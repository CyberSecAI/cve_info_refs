OpenSSH 4.4 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html> and
	<http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
   that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
   expired.

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
   remote.

 * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
   be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:

 * Implemented conditional configuration in sshd_config(5) using the
   "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
   selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
   hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
   authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
   added in future releases.

 * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
   final hash of SHA256.

 * Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd_config(5). Similar to the
   command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
   the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
   requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
   option.

 * Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd_config(5). This mirrors the
   permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
   control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
   establish.

 * Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).

 * ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.

 * Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
   a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
   established.

 * Extend sshd_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
   specification of command-line arguments.

 * Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
   malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.

 * Many manpage fixes and improvements

 * New portable OpenSSH-specific features:

   - Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
     --with-selinux configure option (experimental)

   - Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
     using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
     This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
     built using the "make package" target

   - Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
     enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.

 * Bugs from <http://bugzilla.mindrot.org> fixed:
    #482  - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
    #906  - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
    #975  - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
            about account validity.
    #981  - Flow stop in SSH2.
    #1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
    #1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
            fork/child signals.
    #1131 - error "buffer_append_space:alloc not supported"
    #1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
            too liberal..
    #1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
    #1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
    #1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
    #1161 - scp -r fails.
    #1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
    #1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
    #1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG_MAX..
    #1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
    #1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
    #1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects  connections due to IP options.
    #1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
    #1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
    #1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
            pam_acct_mgmt fails.
    #1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssh security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0703)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix two security issues and various bugs are
now available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. These
packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

A flaw was found in the way the ssh server wrote account names to the
audit subsystem. An attacker could inject strings containing parts of audit
messages which could possibly mislead or confuse audit log parsing tools.
(CVE-2007-3102)

A flaw was found in the way the OpenSSH server processes GSSAPI
authentication requests. When GSSAPI authentication was enabled in OpenSSH
server, a remote attacker may have been able to determine if a username is
valid. (CVE-2006-5052)

The following bugs were also fixed:

* the ssh daemon did not generate audit messages when an ssh session was

closed.

* GSSAPI authentication sometimes failed on clusters using DNS or

load-balancing.

* the sftp client and server leaked small amounts of memory in some cases.
* the sftp client didn't properly exit and return non-zero status in batch

mode when the destination disk drive was full.

* when restarting the ssh daemon with the initscript, the ssh daemon was

sometimes not restarted successfully because the old running ssh daemon was
not properly killed.

* with challenge/response authentication enabled, the pam sub-process was

not terminated if the user authentication timed out.

All users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

OpenSSH security and bug fix update (RHSA-2007-0703)

Original Release Date: January 2, 2008

Last Revised: March 3, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-527

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

OpenSSH is an implementation of an SSH server and SSH/SCP/SFTP
clients.

OpenSSH was found to contain a flaw in the way the SSH server wrote
account
names into the audit subsystem. If an attacker injected strings
containing
parts of audit messages, it could possibly mislead and/or confuse tools
that
parse the audit logs. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-3102](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3102) to this issue.

OpenSSH's SSH server process was found to contain an issue with
GSSAPI
authentication requests that would potentially allow a remote attacker
to
determine if a given username was valid. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-5052](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5052) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0703.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with OpenSSH installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 5.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity Audix LX | IALX 2.0, 2.0 SP1 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x, 4.0 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 3.1 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 5.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.1 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of OpenSSH, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

More details about these issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5052   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/openssh-4.4p1-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to openssh-4.4p1.   This fixes a few security related issues.  From the release notes found at   http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4:     * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,       that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time       expired.     * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal       handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited       to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable       OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to       pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication       is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears       remote.     * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could       be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.   Links to the CVE entries will be found here:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5052     After this upgrade, make sure the permissions on /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd are set   the way you want them.  Future upgrades will respect the existing permissions   settings.  Thanks to Manuel Reimer for pointing out that upgrading openssh   would enable a previously disabled sshd daemon.     Do better checking of passwd, shadow, and group to avoid adding     redundant entries to these files.  Thanks to Menno Duursma.   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

# OpenSSH: Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-06**

Several Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSH.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/openssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4\_p1-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4\_p1-r5** |

### Background

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered a
pre-authentication vulnerability, causing sshd to spin until the login
grace time has been expired. Mark Dowd found an unsafe signal handler
that was vulnerable to a race condition. It has also been discovered
that when GSSAPI authentication is enabled, GSSAPI will in certain
cases incorrectly abort.

### Impact

The pre-authentication and signal handler vulnerabilities can cause a
Denial of Service in OpenSSH. The vulnerability in the GSSAPI
authentication abort could be used to determine the validity of
usernames on some platforms.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/openssh-4.4_p1-r5"
```

OpenSSH 4.4 was released on 2006-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html
For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu
Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================
Security bugs resolved in this release:
\* Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
expired.
\* Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
remote.
\* On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.
This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:
\* Implemented conditional configuration in sshd\_config(5) using the
"Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
added in future releases.
\* Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
final hash of SHA256.
\* Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd\_config(5). Similar to the
command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys, this forces
the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
option.
\* Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd\_config(5). This mirrors the
permitopen="..." authorized\_keys option, allowing fine-grained
control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
establish.
\* Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).
\* ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
~/.ssh/authorized\_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.
\* Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
established.
\* Extend sshd\_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
specification of command-line arguments.
\* Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.
\* Many manpage fixes and improvements
\* New portable OpenSSH-specific features:
- Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
--with-selinux configure option (experimental)
- Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
built using the "make package" target
- Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.
\* Bugs from http://bugzilla.mindrot.org fixed:
#482 - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
#906 - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
#975 - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
about account validity.
#981 - Flow stop in SSH2.
#1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
#1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
fork/child signals.
#1131 - error "buffer\_append\_space:alloc not supported"
#1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
too liberal..
#1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
#1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
#1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
#1161 - scp -r fails.
#1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
#1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
#1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG\_MAX..
#1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
#1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
#1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects connections due to IP options.
#1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
#1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
#1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
pam\_acct\_mgmt fails.
#1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
greater than 8 characters..
#1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
help messages.
#1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
#1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
non-interactive logins.
#1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
#1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
at log level < INFO).
\* Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
static analysis tool
\* Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
SATURN tool
Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

=== Content from openssh.org_46216b28_20250125_001813.html ===
OpenSSH 4.4 was released on 2006-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.
Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.
T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html and
http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html
For international orders use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order
and for European orders, use http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu
Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================
Security bugs resolved in this release:
\* Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
expired.
\* Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
remote.
\* On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.
This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:
\* Implemented conditional configuration in sshd\_config(5) using the
"Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
added in future releases.
\* Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
final hash of SHA256.
\* Added a "ForceCommand" directive to sshd\_config(5). Similar to the
command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized\_keys, this forces
the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
option.
\* Add a "PermitOpen" directive to sshd\_config(5). This mirrors the
permitopen="..." authorized\_keys option, allowing fine-grained
control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
establish.
\* Add optional logging of transactions to sftp-server(8).
\* ssh(1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
~/.ssh/authorized\_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.
\* Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause ssh(1) to exit (with
a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
established.
\* Extend sshd\_config(5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
specification of command-line arguments.
\* Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.
\* Many manpage fixes and improvements
\* New portable OpenSSH-specific features:
- Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
--with-selinux configure option (experimental)
- Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
built using the "make package" target
- Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.
\* Bugs from http://bugzilla.mindrot.org fixed:
#482 - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
#906 - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
#975 - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
about account validity.
#981 - Flow stop in SSH2.
#1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
#1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
fork/child signals.
#1131 - error "buffer\_append\_space:alloc not supported"
#1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
too liberal..
#1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
#1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
#1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
#1161 - scp -r fails.
#1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
#1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
#1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG\_MAX..
#1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
#1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
#1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects connections due to IP options.
#1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
#1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
#1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
pam\_acct\_mgmt fails.
#1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
greater than 8 characters..
#1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
help messages.
#1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
#1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
non-interactive logins.
#1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
#1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
at log level < INFO).
\* Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
static analysis tool
\* Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
SATURN tool
Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs and
tested releases.

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix two security flaws are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure SHell) protocol implementation. This
package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

Mark Dowd discovered a signal handler race condition in the OpenSSH sshd
server. A remote attacker could possibly leverage this flaw to cause a
denial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-5051) The OpenSSH project believes the
likelihood of successful exploitation leading to arbitrary code execution
appears remote. However, the Red Hat Security Response Team have not yet
been able to verify this claim due to lack of upstream vulnerability
information. We are therefore including a fix for this flaw and have rated
it important security severity in the event our continued investigation
finds this issue to be exploitable.

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a denial of service
bug in the OpenSSH sshd server. A remote attacker can send a specially
crafted SSH-1 request to the server causing sshd to consume a large
quantity of CPU resources. (CVE-2006-4924)

All users of openssh should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches that resolves these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.
