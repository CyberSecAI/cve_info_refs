# users can enter dangerous serialized strings

### Description

Users can enter serialized objects etc. as strings in (e.g.) the "first name" field on the profile page, and these strings aren't necessarily safe to unserialized.

For example, serialized objects run the magic \_ \_wakeup() function when they're unserialized. If the PDO extension is enabled -- and it is by default in PHP 5 -- you can cause a fatal error with this:

```
O:3:"PDO":0:{}

```

Much worse, you can enter something like:

```
a:100000000:{}

```

i.e., an array with 100,000,000 elements. PHP doesn't know they're empty, so it starts eating up memory. In my test it crashed Apache.

Either way, it's a problem. I think it's best to add something to maybe\_unserialize(), since just sanitizing input will still leave plugins vulnerable down the road.

I'm not adding a patch since I can only think of hacks like checking for /O:/ or that the number of elements doesn't go over some arbitrary limit. Thoughts?

Maybe a type-hinting field for the setting, so something input as a string isn't unserialized?

We should probably get smart and maintain a list of what can be unserialised and what is just plain text. No untrusted data should ever be unserialised.

Another possible solution is to just serialize everything, including strings.

random's suggestion is one I've also proposed. The counter-argument was that it would make it difficult for non-PHP scripts to make use of string data in our options tables.

I think it's pretty trivial to parse a PHP serialized string, so we shouldn't worry about non-PHP programs integrating with our options tables. Serializing every option is fine by me.

Am I missing something? If we serialized everything, wouldn't we unserialize everything as well? Why would anyone have to worry about parsing strings, wouldn't a string be returned?

+1 for serializing everything.

As long as plugins are using the API, it should be fine. I can think of one place in WP where the API is not used, (direct query in wp-settings.php:123) but it just checks that there is a value, it doesn't use the value itself.

As for upgrading of existing strings, couldn't we just let it happen naturally? We'd still be passing stuff through the "maybe unserialize" function, so it'd just get upgraded whenever it was updated.

I'm testing out the uploaded patch on a local SVN test install. It serializes in update\_option() and add\_option() in every case (not just object and array).

Problem: using the secret "options.php" page will destroy your options table. The serialized strings are re-serialized, and serialized arrays are serialized as a string. We'll have to make a special case for this page, and skip serialization.

Okay, I kludged it and made it skip serialization on options.php

Also, user options are now serialized on update, which is really the area where there is the most danger of a malicious attack (someone with a subscriber profile inserts a 1 million member array and crashes the server).

I thought of other ways of avoiding double serialization... there are GPL is\_serialized() functions floating around, but they'd likely leave openings for abuse, as well as cause a lot of extra cycles on option updates... so a kludge for /wp-admin/options.php might actually be the best way. Thoughts?

There's a serialize call in delete\_usermeta() as well as update\_usermeta(), and let's not forget postmeta.

Speaking of postmeta, [changeset:3656](/changeset/3656 "Add meta_key and meta_value options to get_posts() and get_pages(). ...") added querying by meta\_value, so that'd need changing too. (Speaking of which, is querying going to be a problem elsewhere?)

For options.php, we could unserialize and gettype() the result, reserialize if necessary for display, but add a hidden

```
<input type="hidden" name="type[$option_name]" value="array" />

```

field (or similar) to keep track of what's already serialized when the data gets sent back.

You know what? Serializing everything is really more trouble than it is worth. It will break dozens of plugins, and make troubleshooting a nightmare. Manually editing the options table will be a hellish experience.

The problem (i.e. the security risk) is this: serialized objects/arrays are inserted into the database as simple text, but are interpreted as objects/arrays when coming out. We need to recognize when someone is trying to do that, and block it.

So what we need is a function that can detect serialized data WITHOUT doing an acual unserialize test on it. I've seen several GPL functions that do that, using various techniques. So what I'm going to do is find all such GPL functions, merge them (if necessary) and use that is\_serialized() check for the update/add/delete functions so that it rejects serialized data. Next, I'll need to make changes to options.php and post meta so that it doesn't display serialized data. For example, the feeds that are stored in the options table show up in options.php, and you can save them. Honestly, serialized data is a bear to edit, and I really don't think anyone is going to miss it if we just have the value field deactivated and maybe write "array" or "object" and ignore those fields on update.

How's that sound? I just really don't think that serializing plain text strings is a good move in terms of usability and backwards compatability.

How about prepending a hash of the DB password or some such server secret to all serialized values, then unserializing only the values that matched that key?

Hm, possible solution, but it'd have to be more permanent than that, as a DB password change would effectively kill the blog.

Still working on my patch.

First stab at `is_serialized()` and associated code. Noticed that a lot of the object/array serialization stuff was duplicated, so I made and used a new function `prepare_data()`

I also made `maybe_unserialize()` first check `is_serialized()` because it should be faster to run the small grep than do the unserialization... because most options are not serialized.

Post meta that is serialized is simply not shown to the user.

on options.php, serialized data is marked as such, and the value is not editable.

This might be a bit simpler:

```
function is_serialized($arg) {
    return unserliaze($arg) !== false;
}

```

See [​http://us2.php.net/unserialize](http://us2.php.net/unserialize) for an explanation.

Instead of throwing an error if is\_serialized() is true, that string could be double-serialized -- I mean, if I self-identify as a serialized array, who are you to stop me putting that in my bio? ;)

Seriously though, I think the Right way is to ensure that something saved as a string isn't unserialized, not to put a fence up to keep certain types of strings out. Short of an ugly meta\_value\_type column I don't see a non-hackish way to do that, though, so +1 for Mark's latest patch.

David, running unserialize() on everything kind of defeats the purpose of having an is\_serialized() function at all. :)

### [#17](#comment:17) [@markjaquith](https://profiles.wordpress.org/markjaquith) [19 years](/timeline?from=2006-03-25T04%3A21%3A39Z&precision=second "See timeline at 03/25/2006 04:21:39 AM") ago

Good idea, random. I was worried about false-positives. This way, data that looks to be serialized can still be stored, but won't be dangerous, because it's just a serialized string. Those instances should be very rare. And anyway, that data would cause problems now anyway... because what should be a string will come out looking like an array or an object... this way we preserve it as a string.

Writing it up now.

And David, the reason we don't want to try to unserialize it is that it could be a string masquerading as serialized data, like an array with 100 million members. the maybe\_unserialize() function does just that, and that's what is causing this whole problem.

Latest patch does the following:

* Strings that appear to be already serialized data are serialized again, when adding/updating the meta/option
* Serialized strings are unserialized for display in postmeta and option.php fields
* Serialized arrays/objects are displayed as %SERIALIZED\_DATA% on options.php and the field is uneditable. These values are ignored on update.
* maybe\_unserialize() runs an is\_serialized() check first, instead of just blindly unserializing. This should make it faster (I think).
* A new function, prepare\_data(), does the work of serializing objects/arrays as well as serializing strings that are already serialized data, and doing trim() on strings. This replaces about 4 or 5 instances of redundant code (yay!)
* Custom fields with non-string data are simply not displayed. They're not meant to be user-editable anyway.

I think that's it. Please test thoroughly. Try entering malicious data like the data "random" presented in a custom field or an options field. Try entering it in an options.php field. Try to find an instance where valid, serialized data is not serialized again (if it shows up in options.php and unserialize($data) doesn't return false, you've found a false negative).

### [#20](#comment:20) [@elronxenu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/elronxenu) [18 years](/timeline?from=2006-09-04T13%3A41%3A29Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/04/2006 01:41:29 PM") ago

This is basically a data escaping problem. The requirement is to reliably return the same data which was put into the database, whether a scalar or a complex object.

The solution is to prefix all complex objects with a '\*', and to prefix all scalar strings which begin with a '\*' or a '$' with a '$'. That way, "$fred" becomes "$$fred" and "\*fred" becomes "$\*fred" but an object which is serialized looks something like "\*a:5000:{}".

When processing data read from the database, if a string begins with "\*" then deserialize it, and if it begins with "$" then strip the leading $ sign.

(You can choose less common characters than '\*' and '$', I just used them to illustrate the concept).

Take 4 is up. Things to try:

Enter this into postmeta, an option field, an options.php field, or a profile field:

`s:4:"test";`

It should stay the same. If you get `test` back out, that's a problem.

Enter this into the same places:

`a:100000{`}

your server shouldn't crash, and you should get that same string back.

In both cases, the serialized data you tried to sneak in should appear in the DB as that string re-serialized.

objects or arrays inserted by the system should look like like they did before... serialized representations. plain text strings should also stay the same. The only thing that gets treated specially is user-entered text masquerading as a pre-serialized object.

Would appreciate if people would test this out thoroughly, on test installs.

Make sure that a serialized string doesn't come out as the string it represents. Make sure that slashes are appropriately added or stripped. Make sure your options, usermeta, and postmeta are not corrupted, using the built-in functions.

One thing I've found, this makes saving your options.php page MUCH faster because it's not churning through those feed arrays.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# WordPress 2.0.5 – Ronan

---

It’s new release time. The latest in our venerable 2.0 series, which now counts over 1.2 million downloads, [is available for download immediately](https://wordpress.org/download/), and we suggest everyone upgrade as this includes security fixes. We’re breaking the tradition of naming releases after jazz musicians to congratulate Ryan Boren on his new son (and first WP baby) Ronan.

What’s new? We have about 50 or so bugfixes, which you [can review on our dev tracker here](https://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=2.0.5), mostly minor bug fixes around feeds, custom fields, and internationalization. If you’d like a nitty-gritty view, check out [Mark’s blog post on the changes](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/10/17/changes-in-wordpress-205/).

Like every release this was the result of a lot of people in the WordPress community, and I’d like to thank all our contributors and testers including Mustlive, Peter Westwood, and Robert Deaton. This is also the first release handled by our new 2.0 maintainer, Mark Jaquith. He joins myself and Ryan with commit access and is “committed” to keeping the 2.0 base stable as we head into the exciting new 2.1 world. Congrats to Mark

# WordPress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200611-10**

Flaws in WordPress allow a Denial of Service, the disclosure of user
metadata and the overwriting of restricted files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.5** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based multiuser blogging system.

### Description

"random" discovered that users can enter serialized objects as strings
in their profiles that will be harmful when unserialized. "adapter"
found out that user-edit.php fails to effectively deny non-permitted
users access to other user's metadata. Additionally, a directory
traversal vulnerability in the wp-db-backup module was discovered.

### Impact

By entering specially crafted strings in his profile, an attacker can
crash PHP or even the web server running WordPress. Additionally, by
crafting a simple URL, an attacker can read metadata of any other user,
regardless of their own permissions. A user with the permission to use
the database backup plugin can possibly overwrite files he otherwise
has no access to.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Every logged in user can spy out the metadata of all other users by typing in the URL /wp-admin/user-edit.php?user\_id=XXX irrespective if he has the right to do this or not. If not in fact there will be shown the error message "You do not have permission to edit this user." but after that message the complete form with all data will also be shown.

* **Milestone**
  set to *2.1*

I can't reproduce this.

You can edit/see your own profile this way but otherwise the edit\_users cap check blocks you from editing someone else.

### [#2](#comment:2) [@adapter](https://profiles.wordpress.org/adapter) [18 years](/timeline?from=2006-09-18T18%3A30%3A38Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/18/2006 06:30:38 PM") ago

That could be another bug.

The whole story: user-edit didn't work on my wordpress-blog www.poplog.de. Tried to edit users other than mine, but always I got the edit-form for my user though I'm the admin. Checked the code of user-edit.php and saw that there are two variables in use:

$user\_id (ID of the user to edit)

and

$user\_ID (ID of the user looged in = in this case: admin-ID = 1)

The values of both were 1 irrespective the value of user\_id in the query string.

Maybe configuration of PHP is the reason for this. PHP on this server doesn't work case sensitive. Therefore I found the bug described above.

### [#3](#comment:3) [@foolswisdom](https://profiles.wordpress.org/foolswisdom) [18 years](/timeline?from=2006-09-22T00%3A43%3A31Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/22/2006 12:43:31 AM") ago

Hi adapter, I have not heard of PHP that is not case sensitive for variables. What PHP are you running?

* **Resolution**
  set to *fixed*
* **Status**
  changed from *new* to *closed*

Thanks foolswisdom. You're right. This bug was caused by my-hacks.php. In one of my blogs I've implemented a user-tracking-functions and there I'm using $user\_id for the ID of the user logged in. Sorry!

But I'm running several installations of wordpress, some of them without any changes and in all of them you can spy out user-data.

But it's easy to patch: Add this line of code in line 71 of user-edit.php:

```
<?php if (!current_user_can('edit_users')) { include('admin-footer.php'); die(); } ?>

```

Hi Adapter,

Thank you for participating in WordPress!

Please do not mark bugs as FIXED. That is done when a fix is checked into the official source tree.

Please try to be as concise as possible. For example when you say "this bug" I do not know if you are referring to the originally reported problem or, my guess, what you thought was causing the "case insensitivity".

Please do not attach files, but attach a diff.

ENV: WP 2.0.4

Using 2 "subscribers", I have not been able to reproduce the problem you describe.

Below "You do not have permission to edit this user." the users \*own\* data is displayed. I think this experience is a bit awkward (and a new bug could be created), but this is not the bug you describe.

That's strange.

Yesterday I downloaded the current release WP 2.0.4 and installed it here: [​http://test.poplog.de](http://test.poplog.de). There you can register, log in and call [​http://test.poplog.de/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user\_id=1](http://test.poplog.de/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user_id=1). You will see admin's data.

Hmm - I can now reproduce this both on your test blog and my test 2.0.4 install.

I believe this affects 2.0.4 and 2.1 so is a candidate for a fictional 2.0.5 as a security release.

I'm attaching patches for 2.0.x and trunk.

Thanks Adapter. I can also now confirm the bug -- also not sure what I was doing before. Thank you for your patience and sticking with it.

I have also verified the fix.

   I think #2938 is a regression, should probably be rolled back. It’s a behavior change, not a bugfix.

   Matt — Yeah, probably right. Plus, it’s a popular one, so it can act as some extra 2.1 upgrade juice.

    Looks like we can expect wordpress 2.1 very soon.

    Mark one question? do you think changing parmalink structure might cause missing link?

    feretris,

    This is unrelated to 2.1 … most of these fixes were backported from fixes already in 2.1

    As for permalink structures, yeah, your links will break if you change your structure, unless you’re going from a `?p=N` structure to something else. `?p=N` will always work.

    > Chris, you can help make TinyMCE better by filing repeatable bug reports that we can fix.

    Wouldn’t filing bug reports involve having to *use* the thing? No thank you. 😉

    `2.0.5` is a security and bugfix release. Atom 1.0 support is more of a feature, so when that gets added, it’ll get added to `Trunk` first.

     Do you need to upload tinymce for the upgrade? Just trying to keep the patch smaller is possible.

     Ummm yeah- what a comedian…Good one Roy \*\*rolling eyes\*\*~

     Tiny MCE has a major tendency to add a lot of extra tags and html in posts at random times which creates some issues so it drives you to not want to use it at all. I submitted the bugs but will a patched version be shipped with the 2.0.5?

     Chris,

     TinyMCE suffers the same issue as most ‘gui’ based embedded HTML editors – it does it’s best to write clean code, but it will often inject far more than needed, to be on the safe side.

     If clean code is important to you, don’t use TinyMCE – stick with the basic editor (or use a good offline editor). You then have as much control over code as you like.

     I wish someone in the WP dev team would take over EditorMonkey (which has been abandoned) and make it an optional editor built into WP. I loved it, but stopped using it when WP development outpaced EM (resulting in annoying bugs).

     Brendan,

     Your definetly right on that and clean code is always best. What I don’t get though is why WordPress developers don’t enchance the usuability of its editor for folks that may not be able to write clean mark-up. I enjoy doing but some just don’t have the capacity to do so. That is the main tool that bloggers use within WordPress right? Just a thought. I think this may be the major reason why some of the desktop clients are favored more than the editor within WordPress itself. We should have the “WordPress Desktop Editor”…nice ring to it yes?

     total newbie here. hey there this might have been asked before, worse, could be a stupid question, but does it natively support the wp-cache plugin already, or is there any plans of having it in the future? thanks and i appreciate the value of work you put into this project.

     > does it natively support the wp-cache plugin already

     The WP-Cache plugin (latest version) continues to function in WordPress, but its functionality has not been integrated into WordPress core, if that’s what you’re asking.

     Autosave will be coming to version 2.1

     2.0.5 was just a bugfix and security release.

     I’ve had problems with the write post editor in IE 7. I don’t know if anyone else has, but when I write a blog entry in IE 7, when I type characters on my keyboard, it takes about 5-10 seconds for those characters to appear on the page inside the editor. This seems to be IE 7 specific. Its almost as if, the ajax text-to-HTML conversion thingy is too slow in IE 7 for some reason. personally I never liked that whole “on the fly” text to html thing anyway, would rather have a plain old text editor. Most of the time, I have to click on the “HTML” tab in quicktags anyway for links that I add, which takes me longer to post a blog entry then it would without it, so I agree with the above comment about the MCE editor. I say we should just get rid of it altogether. or at least a way to disable it, that would really help.

     another suggestion I have, is to pick a admin color scheme that is more pleasing to the eye for people with visual disabilities.. People like me who are visually impaired, have trouble seeing text on white backgrounds.. Usually on webpages I prefer a black background on white letters, instead of the other way around. I am suggesting an alternate stylesheet be created for the WP admin area with darker backgrounds for those of us with visual impairments.

     thanks

     You should [report this issue](http://trac.wordpress.org/newticket/).

     > Its almost as if, the ajax text-to-HTML conversion thingy is too slow in IE 7

     It’s not done via AJAX… TinyMCE does it locally using JS.

     > I agree with the above comment about the MCE editor. I say we should just get rid of it altogether. or at least a way to disable it, that would really help.

     It can be disabled in your user’s profile. Also, starting in 2.1, you’ll be able to disable it globally just by deleting the `/wp-includes/js/tinymce/` directory.

     My theme uses serialized information to store changes in the style, so that users don’t have to edit any hard files.

     This update seems to break this functionality.

     Does this update prevent any and all serialized data from being saved to the database or is there something that I have to add to my theme’s code in order for it to be saved properly. As it stands, this change in WordPress has proven to be a bit of a setback, but I’ll withhold any finger pointing until I can get all the details. 😛

     Jonathan,

     There were indeed security-related changes to code that deals with serialization. Please file a [bug report](http://trac.wordpress.org/newticket) if something is not working correctly.

     You shouldn’t be manually serializing your data before putting it in the database. That was the security issue that is blocked by the update. If you use the built-in `update_option()` and `get_option()`, you don’t have to (and now with 2.0.5 *can’t*) pass serialized data. Just pass the original data (like the array or the object) and WP will take care of it as always, and deliver the original object or array for you on the way out.

     Well, that was almost too simple. I was indeed manually serializing the data. Removed that bit everything works peachy.

     I see white spots there for a bit.

     Thanks for the clarification and now that I understand the specifics of the bugfix, thanks for further increasing WordPress’ security. Kudos.

     I am knew to blogging and not to familiar with HTML, just enough to get by.

     Before I upgraded to 2.0.5 I could add color to my page title, in the left hand column, using HTML in the title on the edit page. This feature helped my readers to know when I had added new material to this page. Since I upgraded I am no longer able to add HTML to my page title without the HTML code showing up on the left side column page title.

     HELP!

     Teresa

     All this talk about the post editing… I hope that you continue to keep the non-visual rich editor. I only use the basic editor because it allows me to customize the code behind the posts. Just my 2 cents.

     Thank you for all your efforts!

     Will this update prevent hackers from being able to hack my blog? This has happened two or three times now! My web host told me that WordPress is easily hacked. It is driving me nuts!

     I am using WordPress on my hugehnagover.com web site and I find it quite good.

     I have to spend some time on it though as it is much more complicated that the Blogger one, but obviously much more powerful.

     I am looking forward to being a pro in the near future.

     When I am, then I will start a blog with my site [how much water drink](http://www.how-much-water-drink.com)

     Cheers, Mike King.

     I’m currently running Duke. Will this throw a monkey wrench into my current configuration? I’m all about an upgrade, but is this a beta release or a stable one?

     Nate,

     This should be a smooth upgrade from Duke. WP 2.0.5 is stable for all who are not running PHP as FastCGI. WP 2.0.6 fixes those issues and a 2.0.6 beta is out now.

     I have noticed that A LOT of “Advanced WYSIWYG” functionality support is lost from the the upgrade from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5… Just wondering if you guys are looking at this?

     I should probably add that the “Advanced WYSIWYG” functionality is from a third party plugin; However the Tiny MCE editor by Moxiecode has full feautured functionality, but the editor in WP only shows simple support. As mentioned above, works in 2.0.4 not in 2.0.5

     Nielson/NetRatings has issued a study showing that the top 10 social networking sites saw traffic grow 47% over the last year, with MySpace seeing the biggest growth (367% increase) and MSN Spaces (286%) seeing the biggest growth. Hosted blogging systems were included in the study.

     One thing to note about those numbers is that while Classmates had one of the lowest positive growth rates at 10%, they spend loads on advertising while MySpace, Youtube, and Facebook haven’t spent a penny.

     If I recall correctly, a couple years ago Classmates.com was one of the 10 largest spenders on online advertising.

     There are plenty of new social networking sites poping up but what get’s me why can’t myspace there instant messenger working. $580 mill and can’t afford to fix instant messenger BAD myspace.

     There are so many better ones how about <http://cubiclelife.net> for example has all the features of myspace plus quizzes, polls, webchat with audio and video oh and hey they have instant messenger. You have a long way to go myspace.

     We’re going through some of these changes so fast, I can barely keep up. The new version seems fairly stable, though, and is working out just fine.

     Smooth upgrade for us which also solved a problem we were having with spam posts being added to existing blog posts using the CSS Display Hide tags. The only reason I spotted what was gioing on was that I went to edit an existing post and it was two foot long with hundreds of spam links. WIth the latest version this has now stopped.
