# Fetchmail

Fetchmail ist ein vollwertiges, robustes, gut dokumentiertes Dienstprogramm zum Abrufen und Weiterleiten von Remote-Mails, das für die Verwendung über On-Demand-TCP/IP-Verbindungen (wie SLIP- oder PPP-Verbindungen) vorgesehen ist. Es unterstützt jedes Remote-Mail-Protokoll, das derzeit im Internet verwendet wird: POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, alle Varianten von IMAP, ETRN und ODMR. Es kann sogar IPv6 und IPSEC unterstützen.

Fetchmail ruft E-Mails von entfernten Mail-Servern ab und leitet sie über SMTP weiter, so dass sie dann von normalen Mail-Benutzeragenten wie mutt, elm oder BSD Mail gelesen werden können. Es ermöglicht es allen Filter-, Weiterleitungs- und Aliasing-Funktionen Ihres System-MTAs, genauso zu arbeiten wie auf normalen E-Mails.

Fetchmail bietet einen besseren Schutz vor Passwortsniffing als jeder andere Unix-Remote-Mail-Client. Es unterstützt APOP, KPOP, OTP, Compuserve RPA, Microsoft NTLM und IMAP RFC1731 verschlüsselte Authentifizierungsmethoden einschließlich CRAM-MD5, um das Senden von Passwörtern en clair zu vermeiden. Es kann konfiguriert werden, um eine End-to-End-Verschlüsselung über Tunneling mit ssh, der Secure Shell, zu unterstützen.

Fetchmail kann als POP/IMAP-zu-SMTP-Gateway für eine gesamte DNS-Domäne verwendet werden, indem E-Mails aus einer einzigen Dropdown-Box auf einem ISP gesammelt und SMTP basierend auf Kopfadressen weitergeleitet werden. (Wir empfehlen dies jedoch nicht wirklich, da es wichtige Informationen über den Kuvertkopf verlieren kann. ETRN oder eine UUCP-Verbindung ist besser.)

Fetchmail kann automatisch und geräuschlos als Systemdämon beim Booten gestartet werden. Wenn man in diesem Modus mit einem kurzen Poll-Intervall läuft, ist es für jeden ziemlich schwer zu sagen, dass der eingehende Mail-Link keine Vollzeit- „Push“-Verbindung ist.

Fetchmail ist einfach zu konfigurieren. Sie können die Dotfile direkt bearbeiten oder den interaktiven GUI-Konfigurator (fetchmailconf) verwenden, der mit der fetchmail-Distribution geliefert wird. Es wird auch direkt in linuxconf Versionen 1.16r8 und höher unterstützt.

Fetchmail ist schnell und leicht. Es enthält alle seine Standardfunktionen (POP3-, IMAP- und ETRN-Unterstützung) in 196K Core auf einem Pentium unter Linux.

Fetchmail ist eine Open-Source- und kostenlose Software.

## Download

Fetchmail Download unter <https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/>

## Alternative

Eine gute Alternative ist getmail.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5974   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5867   Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/fetchmail-6.3.6-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:   Upgraded to fetchmail-6.3.6.  This fixes two security issues.  First, a bug   introduced in fetchmail-6.3.5 could cause fetchmail to crash.  However,   no stable version of Slackware ever shipped fetchmail-6.3.5.  Second, a long   standing bug (reported by Isaac Wilcox) could cause fetchmail to send a   password in clear text or omit using TLS even when configured otherwise.   All fetchmail users are encouraged to consider using getmail, or to upgrade   to the new fetchmail packages.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5974     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5867   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fetchmail: Denial of Service and password disclosure — GLSA **200701-13**

Fetchmail has been found to have numerous vulnerabilities allowing for
Denial of Service and password disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/fetchmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.3.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.3.6** |

### Background

Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility.

### Description

Neil Hoggarth has discovered that when delivering messages to a message
delivery agent by means of the "mda" option, Fetchmail passes a NULL
pointer to the ferror() and fflush() functions when refusing a message.
Isaac Wilcox has discovered numerous means of plain-text password
disclosure due to errors in secure connection establishment.

### Impact

An attacker could deliver a message via Fetchmail to a message delivery
agent configured to refuse the message, and crash the Fetchmail
process. SMTP and LMTP delivery modes are not affected by this
vulnerability. An attacker could also perform a Man-in-the-Middle
attack, and obtain plain-text authentication credentials of users
connecting to a Fetchmail process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All fetchmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/fetchmail-6.3.6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
