The content describes a vulnerability in gCards version 1.13, specifically a remote file inclusion vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `languagefile` parameter in `gcards/admin/addnews.php` not being properly sanitized before being used in an `include_once` statement.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes a file based on the value of the `languagefile` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By manipulating the `languagefile` parameter, an attacker can include a file from a remote server containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `gcards/admin/addnews.php` by setting the `languagefile` parameter to a remote URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to have a remote server hosting the malicious code.
