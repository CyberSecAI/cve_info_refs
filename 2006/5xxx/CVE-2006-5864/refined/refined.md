Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2006-5864 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the handling of user-supplied data within the PostScript parsing code of GNU gv, which is used by other applications such as Evince and mgv. Specifically, there's a lack of boundary checks when copying user-provided data into process buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow. When the application copies user-supplied data without proper length validation, an attacker can provide input larger than the buffer, leading to overwriting adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application (Evince, gv, or mgv).
- **Denial of Service:** The overflow can cause the application to crash leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted PostScript document:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a specially crafted PostScript file (.ps) with the vulnerable application.
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is often described as "remote" because an attacker can send a malicious file to a user to open.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PostScript document.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted PostScript document using a vulnerable application such as Evince, gv, or mgv.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Multiple Affected Applications:** The vulnerability is not only in GNU gv but also affects other applications like Evince and mgv that use or include code from gv.
- **Gentoo Advisories:** Gentoo Linux issued advisories (GLSA 200611-20 for gv, GLSA 200704-06 for Evince, GLSA 200703-24 for mgv) detailing the vulnerability and recommended upgrades.
- **Ubuntu Security Notices:** Ubuntu also issued security notices (USN-390-1, USN-390-2 and USN-390-3) to address the vulnerability in evince and evince-gtk.
- **Debian Security Advisory:** Debian issued DSA 1243-1, advising users to update evince to fix the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- **CERT Vulnerability Note:** The CERT vulnerability note VU#352825 provided an overview of the vulnerability, along with affected vendors.
- **Exploit-DB entry:** Exploit-DB lists an exploit (EDB-ID: 2858) that can be used against evince, detailing how to craft a malicious PostScript file to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Workarounds:** While upgrading is the primary solution, there's no known workaround, according to some sources. One source recommended not running gv with root privileges.
- **Unmaintained mgv:** The mgv package was unmaintained at the time of discovery of this vulnerability, and has been masked in Portage as a result.

In summary, CVE-2006-5864 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in GNU gv that can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PostScript file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. It affects gv directly, as well as applications embedding gv code such as evince and mgv. Multiple Linux distributions released security advisories and patches to address this vulnerability.
