```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! component Joomlaboard 1.1.1 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion due to insufficient input validation in the `sbp` parameter within the `file_upload.php` and potentially `image_upload.php` files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This allows for complete compromise of the affected system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to `file_upload.php` (and possibly `image_upload.php`) containing a malicious URL in the `sbp` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application and have a publicly accessible remote server hosting the malicious file.
