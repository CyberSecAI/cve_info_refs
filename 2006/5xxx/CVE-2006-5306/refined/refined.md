RELATED: CVE-2006-5306

Root cause of vulnerability:
The phpBB Journals System Mod 1.0.2 RC2 suffers from a remote file inclusion vulnerability.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion: The vulnerability allows an attacker to include a remote file, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code. The `phpbb_root_path` parameter in `includes/journals_delete.php`, `includes/journals_post.php`, and `includes/journals_edit.php` is vulnerable.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web server and the application.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to one of the vulnerable files (`journals_delete.php`, `journals_post.php`, or `journals_edit.php`) with a malicious URL passed in the `phpbb_root_path` parameter. The attacker provides the URL of a file hosted on a remote server under their control.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and have a remote server where they can host a malicious file containing arbitrary code to be executed on the target system.
