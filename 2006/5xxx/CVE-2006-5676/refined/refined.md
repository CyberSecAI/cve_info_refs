    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-5676",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_0fbfd326_20250125_135609.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'champ' parameter of the 'classement.php' script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other database contents. The provided exploit targets user credentials within the `phpl_membres` table.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to 'classement.php' with a crafted 'champ' parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the application's structure and database schema to craft the SQL injection payload. The provided ASP exploit code demonstrates how to automate this process, requiring only the target URL and User ID from the user."
