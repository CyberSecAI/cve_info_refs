Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5351:

**CVE-2006-5351**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within Oracle Application Express (APEX), specifically in the `NOTIFICATION_MSG` and `WWV_FLOW_ITEM_HELP` components, as well as the `WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES` package
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users. This occurs because user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed.
    *  **SQL Injection:** In `WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES`, an SQL injection vulnerability exists.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Successful XSS exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Redirection to malicious sites
        *   Theft of sensitive user information
    *  **SQL Injection**: Could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized queries or data modification in the database.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   XSS attacks are typically carried out by injecting malicious scripts via URL parameters, user input fields or other mechanisms, that get reflected back to the user by the vulnerable application.
    *   SQL injection is typically performed via crafted input to parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious input into the vulnerable application. This could involve crafted URLs, or manipulating data sent to the application through input fields or other parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content from `red-database-security.com` provides more detail than the CVE description. It lists specific vulnerable components in Oracle APEX (`NOTIFICATION_MSG`, `WWV_FLOW_ITEM_HELP`, and `WWV_FLOW_UTILITIES`) and identifies both XSS and SQL injection issues, whereas the CVE itself only broadly references a vulnerability in "Oracle Application Express."
*  The `red-database-security.com` content also maps the specific APEX vulnerabilities to the CVE ID.
*   It further identifies that most of the 35 APEX security bugs were already fixed in earlier versions, so upgrading from older version prior to 2.1 is highly recommended.
*   The `secunia.com` content mentions Secunia Research as a source of vulnerability intelligence which is relevant, but does not contain specific technical details about CVE-2006-5351
*   The `vupen.com` content is unrelated.
