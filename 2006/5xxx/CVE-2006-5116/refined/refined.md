Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2006-5116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands by tricking an authenticated user into following a crafted link. The vulnerability is related to how phpMyAdmin handles user sessions and URL generation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability allowing the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
- The vulnerability affects multiple files: `libraries/common.lib.php`, `session.inc.php`, and `url_generating.lib.php`.
- The initial fix in version 2.9.1-rc1 was incomplete, and some issues remained.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database managed by the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance.
- This could result in unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially leading to full compromise of the database and related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted link that the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking. This can be achieved through various social engineering methods, including phishing emails, malicious websites, or injecting the link into forums/comments.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the phpMyAdmin server but relies on the active session of a legitimate user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know that a user is using a vulnerable version of phpMyAdmin.
- The attacker does not need to know the credentials of the user, only that they are logged into a phpMyAdmin instance.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and to trick the user into clicking that URL.
