## IBM Tivoli Storage Manager SmExecuteWdsfSession( ) function vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#350625

Original Release Date: 2007-02-05 | Last Revised: 2007-02-09

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow condition exists in certain login fields on the IBM Tivoli Storage manager server. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability would allow an attacker to
cause a denial-of-service condition or possibly execute arbitrary code

### Description

| The IBM [Tivoli Storage Manager](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr/) (TSM) is a remote backup software package that runs on clients and servers. TSM clients must register and authenticate to servers before performing backup functions. The SmExecuteWdsfSession() function is used during the initial part of the authentication process.  From a [public vulnerability report](http://www.tippingpoint.com/security/advisories/TSRT-06-14.html), a buffer overflow vulnerability exists in this function. The overflow can be triggered during the processing of two separate fields sent in the request, both of which are copied into fixed sized buffers, without any validation of their lengths.An attacker may be able to send specially crafted malformed input to the SmExecuteWdsfSession() funtion that triggers a buffer overflow on the TSM Server.Note that IBM has released the below information on their [support site](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250261), which conflicts with the original public report:*This problem relates to an internal buffer overflow in TSM but IBM does not believe it is possible to exploit this buffer overflow for remote code execution, however, this exposure can be used to crash the TSM server.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause the TSM server to crash, thereby creating a denial-of-service condition. It may also be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the TSM server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  The [update](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250261) provided by IBM may address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restricting access to port 1500/tcp at the network perimeter may mitigate the effects of this vulnerability. Note that an administrator can change the port that the TSM servers use with the [port\_address](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v1r1/topic/com.ibm.itsmc.doc/ans10000251.htm#opt6088) parameter. |

## IBM Tivoli Storage Manager vulnerable to a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#478753

Original Release Date: 2007-02-05 | Last Revised: 2007-02-09

---

### Overview

A buffer overflow condition exists in the IBM Tivoli Storage manager. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability would allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The IBM [Tivoli Storage Manager](http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/products/storage-mgr/) (TSM) is a remote backup software package that runs on clients and servers. TSM clients must register with servers before performing backup functions. TSM servers can be configured to allow closed or open registration. Per the Tivoli User Guide, in [open registration](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v1r1/topic/com.ibm.itsmhpn.doc/update/anrhrf53389.htm#setregs), when a user accesses a server from an unregistered client, the server prompts the user for a node name, password, and contact information before registering the workstation.  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way the TSM server performs this open registration message proccessing. An attacker may be able to send a specially crafted registration message to a vulnerable TSM server that triggers the overflow.Note that IBM has released the below information on their [support site](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250261), which conflicts with the original public report:*This problem relates to an internal buffer overflow in TSM but IBM does not believe it is possible to exploit this buffer overflow for remote code execution, however, this exposure can be used to crash the TSM server.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause the TSM server to crash, thereby creating a denial-of-service condition. It may also be possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the TSM server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  The [update](http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250261) provided by IBM may address this issue. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**  Restricting access to port 1500/tcp at the network perimeter may mitigate the effects of this vulnerability. Note that an administrator can change the port that the TSM servers use with the [port\_address](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/tivihelp/v1r1/topic/com.ibm.itsmc.doc/ans10000251.htm#opt6088) parameter. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

TSRT-06-14: IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Mutiple Buffer Overflow
Vulnerabilities
http://www.tippingpoint.com/security/advisories/TSRT-06-14.html
December 4, 2006
-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-5855
-- Affected Vendor:
IBM
-- Affected Products:
Tivoli Storage Manager <5.2.9
Tivoli Storage Manager <5.3.4
-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since April 3, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 4248. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:
http://www.tippingpoint.com
-- Vulnerability Details:
These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication
is not required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
The specific flaws are similar and exist in the processing of messages
by the Tivoli Storage Manager service, bound on TCP port 1500. The
messages are structured in the form [index][size]. The 'index' field
specifies an integer offset into the body of the message for a specific
field, and the 'size' field specifies the size of the indexed field.
As no validation is done on the index fields, an attacker can force the
service to look beyond the end of the packet, often landing in
unallocated memory and resulting in a denial of service.
The size fields are often checked to ensure they do not exceed the
bounds of the destination buffers that data is being copied to.
However, we have found the following four instances where the size
files are left unchecked:
Overflow 1
The initial sign-on request contains a field to specify the language.
In normal cases we've seen, this string is dscenu.txt. Typically the
server will validate that the language string is no longer than 0x100
bytes. However, if the first byte of the language string is 0x18, this
check will not occur, and a fixed sized buffer will be overrun.
Overflows 2 and 3
There is an overflow vulnerability in messages processed by the
SmExecuteWdsfSession function. There are two fields in this request,
both are copied into fixed sized buffers, without any validation of
their lengths.
Overflow 4
There is an overflow in the open registration message due to an
unchecked copy into a fixed size buffer for the contact field of the
registration.
All four of the above detailed overflows can lead to arbitrary code
execution under the context of the Tivoli service.
-- Vendor Response:
IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21250261
-- Disclosure Timeline:
2006.04.03 - Digital Vaccine released to TippingPoint customers
2006.05.09 - Vulnerability reported to vendor
2006.12.04 - Coordinated public release of advisory
-- Credit:
This vulnerability was discovered by the TippingPoint Security Research
Team.
-- About the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI):
Established by TippingPoint, a division of 3Com, The Zero Day Initiative
(ZDI) represents a best-of-breed model for rewarding security
researchers for responsibly disclosing discovered vulnerabilities.
Researchers interested in getting paid for their security research
through the ZDI can find more information and sign-up at:
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com
The ZDI is unique in how the acquired vulnerability information is used.
3Com does not re-sell the vulnerability details or any exploit code.
Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor, 3Com provides its
customers with zero day protection through its intrusion prevention
technology. Explicit details regarding the specifics of the
vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until an official vendor
patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the altruistic aim of
helping to secure a broader user base, 3Com provides this vulnerability
information confidentially to security vendors (including competitors)
who have a vulnerability protection or mitigation product.
