  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-5855",
      "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflows exist due to insufficient validation of input data lengths in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager server.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer overflow in the language field of the initial sign-on request if the first byte is 0x18, bypassing the length check.",
        "Buffer overflows in the SmExecuteWdsfSession function during the processing of two fields due to a lack of length validation when copying into fixed-size buffers.",
        "Buffer overflow in the open registration message processing when copying the contact field into a fixed-size buffer without length validation."
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (crashing the TSM server) or potentially arbitrary code execution in the context of the TSM server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Sending a malformed sign-on request to trigger the language field overflow.",
        "Sending specially crafted messages to the SmExecuteWdsfSession function with oversized fields.",
        "Sending a crafted registration message with an oversized contact field to an open registration enabled TSM server."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages to the TSM server on TCP port 1500.",
       "additional_notes": "IBM has acknowledged the buffer overflow issues but believes they are only exploitable for denial of service, contradicting other reports that indicate potential for remote code execution. The vulnerability is present in versions of Tivoli Storage Manager prior to 5.2.9 and 5.3.4. TippingPoint IPS customers were protected from this vulnerability via a Digital Vaccine filter ID 4248 since April 3, 2006."
