Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `sq_remote_page_url` function in Squiz MySource Matrix allows the inclusion of remote content into the body of a website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorised HTTP Proxy:** The software can be used as an unauthorized HTTP proxy by fetching and displaying content from arbitrary URLs.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Remote content, which could include malicious JavaScript, can be executed in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Proxy Abuse:** An attacker can use the vulnerable website as a proxy server, potentially consuming significant bandwidth and incurring costs for the website owner.
*   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the proxied content, enabling actions such as stealing cookies or performing other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a URL with the `sq_remote_page_url` parameter, pointing to a malicious website or content.
*   The crafted URL is accessed by a user, causing the vulnerable website to fetch and display the attacker's content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs no authentication and can be an anonymous user.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable `sq_remote_page_url` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable Squiz MySource Matrix installation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor did not initially consider this a vulnerability, instead suggesting the use of a whitelist and base64 encoding of the URL parameter.
*   The issue was discovered during an audit on April 27, 2006, and publicly disclosed on September 22, 2006.
*   Newer versions introduced `sq_content_src` to hide URL using Base64 encoding and utilize a whitelist to limit inclusions.
*   Remote PHP inclusion does not appear to be possible, it returns % hex value.
