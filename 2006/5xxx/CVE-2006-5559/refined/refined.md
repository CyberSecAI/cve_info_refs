  "CVE-2006-5559": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the ADODB.Connection ActiveX control that is provided as part of the ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and that is distributed in MDAC. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "Root cause": "The ADODB.Connection ActiveX control, when processing unexpected data, can cause a memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability within the ADODB.Connection ActiveX control due to improper parameter validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user, potentially taking complete control of an affected system, installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights. It can also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment).",
      "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML document or web page.",
      "The attacker must trick the user to visit the malicious web page or open the malicious document."
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability resides within the `Execute()` function of the ADODB.Connection ActiveX object.  The vulnerability is triggered by improper parameter validation. The severity is rated as Critical on systems like Windows 2000 and XP but rated as Moderate on Windows Server 2003 due to Enhanced Security Configuration which sets the Internet Zone security level to High, mitigating the attack.  Microsoft also mentions that this vulnerability was publicly disclosed by YAG KOHHA."
