# USN-375-1: PHP vulnerability

3 November 2006

PHP vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Stefan Esser discovered two buffer overflows in the htmlentities() and

htmlspecialchars() functions. By supplying specially crafted input to

PHP applications which process that input with these functions, a

remote attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the application. ([CVE-2006-5465](/security/CVE-2006-5465))

This update also fixes bugs in the chdir() and tempnam() functions,

which did not perform proper open\_basedir checks. This could allow

local scripts to bypass intended restrictions.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.4
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* php5-cli
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.6
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.6

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

# PHP 5.2.0 Release Announcement

The PHP development team is proud to announce the immediate release of PHP
5.2.0. This release is a major improvement in the 5.X series, which includes a
large number of new features, bug fixes and security enhancements.

**The key features of PHP 5.2.0 include:**

* New memory manager for the Zend Engine with improved performance and a more accurate memory usage tracking.
* Input filtering extension was added and enabled by default.
* JSON extension was added and enabled by default.
* ZIP extension for creating and editing zip files was introduced.
* Hooks for tracking file upload progress were introduced.
* Introduced E\_RECOVERABLE\_ERROR error mode.
* Introduced DateTime and DateTimeZone objects with methods to manipulate date/time information.
* Upgraded bundled SQLite, PCRE libraries.
* Upgraded OpenSSL, MySQL and PostgreSQL client libraries for Windows installations.
* Many performance improvements.
* Over 200 bug fixes.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.2.0:**

* Made PostgreSQL escaping functions in PostgreSQL and PDO extension keep track of character set encoding whenever possible.
* Added allow\_url\_include, set to Off by default to disallow use of URLs for include and require.
* Disable realpath cache when open\_basedir and safe\_mode are being used.
* Improved safe\_mode enforcement for error\_log() function.
* Fixed a possible buffer overflow in the underlying code responsible for htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities() functions.
* Added missing safe\_mode and open\_basedir checks for the cURL extension.
* Fixed overflow in str\_repeat() & wordwrap() functions on 64bit machines.
* Fixed handling of long paths inside the tempnam() function.
* Fixed safe\_mode/open\_basedir checks for session.save\_path, allowing them to account for extra parameters.
* Fixed ini setting overload in the ini\_restore() function.

All users of PHP, especially those using earlier PHP 5 releases are advised
to upgrade to this release as soon as possible. This release also obsoletes
the 5.1 branch of PHP.

For users upgrading from PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1 there is an upgrading guide
available [here](/UPDATE_5_2.txt), detailing the changes between those releases
and PHP 5.2.0.
