Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the way e107 handles language settings through cookies. Specifically, the 'e107language_e107cookie' cookie is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application includes files based on the value of the 'e107language_e107cookie' cookie without proper validation.
- Code Injection: The exploit uses log poisoning to inject PHP code into log files. Because the path to the log files is under the attacker's control via the LFI, the injected code can be executed by including the log file.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: By injecting PHP code into log files and then including those files via the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP Cookie Manipulation: The attacker sets the 'e107language_e107cookie' to a path of their choice, targeting server logs or other files.
- HTTP GET Request to include the target file based on the injected path.
- Log Poisoning: The attacker injects malicious PHP code into server log files by sending a crafted request that gets logged.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable e107 application.
- Knowledge of the application's directory structure is helpful.
- The attacker needs to have a registered user account to successfully log in and inject the payload, prior to exploiting the LFI.
