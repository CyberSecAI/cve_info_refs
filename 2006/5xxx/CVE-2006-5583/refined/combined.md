# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows SNMP Memory Corruption Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#901584

Original Release Date: 2006-12-13 | Last Revised: 2007-01-05

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft Windows handles SNMP may allow a buffer overflow that may allow remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows contains a buffer overflow that may occur when handling malformed SNMP packets. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms06-074](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-074.mspx) the exploit is triggered by sending a specially crafted SNMP packet to a vulnerable system.  Note that the SNMP service is not installed on any version of Microsoft Windows by default. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms06-074](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-074.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Apply a Workaround**       + Block UDP port 161 + Disable SNMP service - Note that according to Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms06-074](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-074.mspx):  *If you disable the SNMP service, you may not be able to monitor systems via SNMP.* See Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms06-074](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-074.mspx) for more details. |

## Vulnerability Details

#### SNMP Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5583:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in SNMP Service that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for SNMP Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5583:

* SNMP service is not installed by default in any supported version of Windows.
* For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for SNMP Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-5583:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Restrict the IP addresses that are allowed to manage the computer.**

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
  2. In the **Open** box, type **services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  3. Click **SNMP Service** and select **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Security tab** and select **Accept SNMP packets from these hosts**.
  5. Add the approved management station's IP address by clicking **Add**, typing in the IP address or host name, and clicking **Add**.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + UDP port 161

  This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking it at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured SNMP port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the Windows Firewall, which is included with Windows XP.**

  By default, the Windows Firewall feature in Windows XP helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  + Click **Start,** and then click **Control Panel**.
  + Double-click **Network Connections** and then click **Change Windows Firewall settings.**
  + On the **General tab**, ensure that the **On** (recommended) value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.
  + Once the Windows Firewall is enabled, select **Donât allow exceptions** to prohibit all incoming traffic.

  If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, de-select **Donât allow exceptions** and click the Exceptions tab. On the Exceptions tab, select the programs, protocols, and services you want to enable.
* To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
* **Disable the SNMP service**

  Disabling the SNMP service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the SNMP service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **SNMP Service**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the SNMP service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop SNMP & sc config SNMP start= disabled`
* **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the SNMP service, you may not be able to monitor systems via SNMP.

For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
