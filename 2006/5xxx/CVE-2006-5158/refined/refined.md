  "CVE-2006-5158": {
    "description": "A flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause denial of service (deadlock).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The NFS locking daemon (lockd) did not correctly handle mixing of 'lock' and 'nolock' option mounts on the same client, leading to a deadlock.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of different mount options ('lock' and 'nolock') within the NFS locking daemon."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. The lockd process deadlocks, rendering NFS imports inaccessible and requiring a reboot of the server to recover.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local user on a system that is an NFS client."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user capable of mounting NFS shares with specific combinations of lock and nolock options."
