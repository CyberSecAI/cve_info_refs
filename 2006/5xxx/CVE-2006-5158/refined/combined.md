## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0488)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and bugs in the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel are now available.

This security advisory has been rated as having important security impact
by the Red Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the security issues described
below:

* a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed a remote

user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
(CVE-2007-2876, Important)

* a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit systems that allowed a

local user to cause denial of service (crash). (CVE-2006-7203, Important)

* a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to cause an

out-of-bounds access. (CVE-2007-2172, Important)

* a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local user

to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket
using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has been
called. (CVE-2007-2525, Important)

* a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on

64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
(panic). (CVE-2007-0773, Important)

* a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause

denial of service (deadlock). (CVE-2006-5158, Moderate)

* a flaw in the sysfs\_readdir function that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. (CVE-2007-3104, Moderate)

* a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user to create core

dumps from unreadable binaries via PT\_INTERP. (CVE-2007-0958, Low)

* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an

information leak. (CVE-2007-1353, Low)

In addition, the following bugs were addressed:

* the NFS could recurse on the same spinlock. Also, NFS, under certain

conditions, did not completely clean up Posix locks on a file close,
leading to mount failures.

* the 32bit compatibility didn't return to userspace correct values for the

rt\_sigtimedwait system call.

* the count for unused inodes could be incorrect at times, resulting in

dirty data not being written to disk in a timely manner.

* the cciss driver had an incorrect disk size calculation (off-by-one

error) which prevented disk dumps.

Red Hat would like to thank Ilja van Sprundel and the OpenVZ Linux kernel
team for reporting issues fixed in this erratum.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users are advised to upgrade their kernels
to the packages associated with their machine architectures and
configurations as listed in this erratum.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not

correcly handle fragmented packets. By sending specially crafted

packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass firewall

rules. This has only be fixed for Ubuntu 6.10; the corresponding fix

for Ubuntu 5.10 and 6.06 will follow soon. ([CVE-2006-4572](/security/CVE-2006-4572))

Dmitriy Monakhov discovered an information leak in the

\_\_block\_prepare\_write() function. During error recovery, this function

did not properly clear memory buffers which could allow local users to

read portions of unlinked files. This only affects Ubuntu 5.10.

([CVE-2006-4813](/security/CVE-2006-4813))

ADLab Venustech Info Ltd discovered that the ATM network driver

referenced an already released pointer in some circumstances. By

sending specially crafted packets to a host over ATM, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash that host. This does not affect

Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-4997](/security/CVE-2006-4997))

Matthias Andree discovered that the NFS locking management daemon

(lockd) did not correctly handle mixing of 'lock' and 'nolock' option

mounts on the same client. A remote attacker could exploit this to

crash lockd and thus rendering the NFS imports inaccessible. This only

affects Ubuntu 5.10. ([CVE-2006-5158](/security/CVE-2006-5158))

The task switching code did not save and restore EFLAGS of processes.

By starting a specially crafted executable, a local attacker could

exploit this to eventually crash many other running processes. This

does not affect Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-5173](/security/CVE-2006-5173))

James Morris discovered that the ip6fl\_get\_n() function incorrectly

handled flow labels. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the

kernel. ([CVE-2006-5619](/security/CVE-2006-5619))

Fabio Massimo Di Nitto discovered that the sys\_get\_robust\_list and

sys\_set\_robust\_list system calls lacked proper lock handling on the

powerpc platform. A local attacker could exploit this to create

unkillable processes, drain all available CPU/memory, and render the

machine unrebootable. This only affects Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-5648](/security/CVE-2006-5648))

Fabio Massimo Di Nitto discovered a flaw in the alignment check

exception handling on the powerpc platform. A local attacker could

exploit this to cause a kernel panic and crash the machine.

([CVE-2006-5649](/security/CVE-2006-5649))

Certain corrupted squashfs file system images caused a memory

allocation to be freed twice. By mounting a specially crafted squashfs

file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel.

This does not affect Ubuntu 5.10. ([CVE-2006-5701](/security/CVE-2006-5701))

An integer overflow was found in the get\_fdb\_entries() function of the

network bridging code. By executing a specially crafted ioctl, a local

attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with root

privileges. ([CVE-2006-5751](/security/CVE-2006-5751))

While this is a simple NULL pointer dereference, it seems to deadlock the NFS lockd and so allows a denial of service attack.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c1)  Jeff Layton    2007-06-08 10:39:24 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [210128](show_bug.cgi?id=210128) ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c2)  Jeff Layton    2007-06-08 10:45:34 UTC  ``` My mistake, didn't realize this was on z-stream proposed. Might have been better to clone the other BZ that contains the patch.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c3)  Jason Baron    2007-06-12 15:33:55 UTC  ```  committed in stream rhel‑4.5.z build 55.0.1    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=243251#c6)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-06-25 18:05:03 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

OK. I think this client patch ought to fix the Oopses. It should apply
to a 2.6.14 kernel as well as 2.6.15-rc5.

NLM: Fix Oops in nlmclnt_mark_reclaim()

Hi, nfs locking stopped working on my file server running 2.6.15-rc5
today.  All clients that try locking operations hang, and I get the
message from the server:

lockd: couldn't create RPC handle for w.x.y.z

Also, the lockd process is unkillable, it looks like I'll have to
reboot.

The nfs mounts look like:

rw,nosuid,nodev,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,udp,lock

I've recently posted the kernel .config and dmesg for both the server
and clients for other bug reports.  For the server:

Message-ID: <20051129200013.GB6326@tau.solarneutrino.net>

and the clients:

Message-ID: <20051208022624.GA12944@tau.solarneutrino.net>

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
-ryan

kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0488)

Original Release Date: July 30, 2007

Last Revised: February 25, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-287

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages. Below
is a list
of the security issues fixed in the update as reported by Red Hat:

- a flaw in the connection tracking support for SCTP that allowed
  a remote
  user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- a flaw in the mount handling routine for 64-bit systems that allowed
  a
  local user to cause denial of service (crash).
- a flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to
  cause an
  out-of-bounds access.
- a flaw in the PPP over Ethernet implementation that allowed a local
  user
  to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by creating a socket
  using connect and then releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl has
  been
  called.
- a flaw in the fput ioctl handling of 32-bit applications running on
  64-bit platforms that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
  (panic).
- a flaw in the NFS locking daemon that allowed a local user to cause
  denial of service (deadlock).
- a flaw in the sysfs\_readdir function that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- a flaw in the core-dump handling that allowed a local user to create
  core
  dumps from unreadable binaries via PT\_INTERP.
- a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to
  trigger an
  information leak.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2007-2876](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2876),
[CVE-2006-7203](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7203),
[CVE-2007-2172](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2172),
[CVE-2007-2525](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2525),
[CVE-2007-0773](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0773),
[CVE-2006-5158](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5158),
[CVE-2007-3104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3104),
[CVE-2007-0958](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0958) and
[CVE-2007-1353](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1353) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0488.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.1 and CM 4.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 3.1.1 or newer | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.x | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
