    "source": "www.exploit-db.com_9b11384e_20250125_130812.html",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in the '/admin/index.php' script.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure direct object reference",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can change user passwords by sending a crafted POST request to the '/admin/index.php' page. This allows the attacker to take over user accounts by changing their password.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack is performed via HTTP POST requests, exploiting the lack of proper validation and authorization checks on the user edit functionality.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know or guess a valid username of the iPrimal Forums installation. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
    },
    "exploit": {
        "description": "The provided Perl script automates the exploitation of this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the target application's admin interface. The script takes the target host, path to the application, username, and the desired new password as command-line arguments.",
        "steps": [
            "The script constructs a POST request containing the target username and the desired new password.",
            "It sends this request to the vulnerable '/admin/index.php' script with the 'p=members&edit=' parameters, where the user is specified in the edit parameter.",
            "The server, lacking sufficient validation, updates the password of the target user.",
            "The script prints a success message indicating the user and password"
