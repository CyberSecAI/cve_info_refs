{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BlooMooWeb ActiveX control lacks proper protection, allowing path parameters to point to any location on the user's hard drive, not just the game's installation directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of file paths in `BW_DownloadFile`, `BW_LaunchGame` and `BW_DeleteTempFile` methods.",
      "Lack of access control or validation to ensure that file operations are confined to the intended game data directory.",
      "Use of non-blocking streaming with overwrite IO permission in `BW_DownloadFile`.",
      "Lack of user interaction requirements or signaling for ActiveX execution."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the user's privileges. Additionally, arbitrary files on the user's system can be deleted, potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via a malicious website or link that induces the user to click the link and silently execute the methods within the ActiveX control.",
       "The attacker can provide a malicious URL to the BW_DownloadFile method which downloads an executable over writing the original BlooMooWeb.exe"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure the victim to a malicious website or make the victim click on a crafted link which utilizes the vulnerable ActiveX control."
