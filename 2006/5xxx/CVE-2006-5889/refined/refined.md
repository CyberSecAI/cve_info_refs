{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the 'id' parameter passed to `printLog.php`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the 'users' table by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "attack_vector": "By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `printLog.php` URL, attackers can inject SQL code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL.",
    "additional_details": "The exploit script constructs a URL with a crafted SQL query that uses `UNION SELECT` to retrieve the user name and password from the `users` table. The script allows iterating through user IDs to retrieve their credentials. The application uses `get_magic_quotes_gpc()` which is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection attacks."
