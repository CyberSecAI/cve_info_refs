1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:** The phpBB PlusXL application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to an insecure implementation in the `constants.php` file. The `phpbb_root_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files through the `phpbb_root_path` parameter.
3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete system compromise.
4.  **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `constants.php` file, with a malicious URL provided in the `phpbb_root_path` parameter.
5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious file on a server that is accessible to the vulnerable application server.
