{
  "CVE-2006-5330": {
    "Description": "HTTP Header Injection Vulnerabilities in the Flash Player Plugin",
    "Root cause": "The `addRequestHeader()` and `contentType` methods in the Flash Player plugin do not sufficiently sanitize their input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "HTTP Header Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can manipulate HTTP headers in requests sent by the Flash Player plugin. This can be used to:\n  - Spoof headers such as `Host`, `Referer`, and `User-Agent`.\n  - Send malformed HTTP requests.\n  - Facilitate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by bypassing `Referer` checks or inserting malicious HTTP request bodies.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious website hosting a Flash object. When a user visits this website, the Flash object executes ActionScript code to construct a malicious HTTP request and send it to a target server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious website with a specially crafted Flash object, then convince users to visit this website. The user must have an affected Flash Player plugin installed."
    ,
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability exists in the XML class' `addRequestHeader()` and `contentType` methods within Flash. When the server supports `keep-alive` connections, and Firefox is used, attackers can insert multiple HTTP requests through HTTP Request Splitting method. When using the HTTP Request Splitting method, the first argument of `addRequestHeader()` must not contain spaces (ASCII 0x20). Additionally, tabs must be used instead of spaces around URI's and the header `Content-length` has to be manually added so that the server knows where the request body ends."
