{
  "CVE-2006-5552": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in RevilloC MailServer 1.x when handling the 'RCPT TO' or 'MAIL FROM' commands with a large buffer (4080 bytes or more). This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to crash or consume excessive CPU resources. It may also allow for a heap overflow, overwriting registers such as EDI, EBX, EAX and ECX if the buffer exceeds 4088 bytes.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking when processing the input to the 'RCPT TO' or 'MAIL FROM' commands, leading to a buffer overflow in the application's heap when a large buffer is sent.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow",
      "Lack of bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS), application crash, excessive CPU usage, and potentially arbitrary code execution (heap overflow). Overwriting registers can allow for control over program execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted, oversized buffer (4080+ bytes) with the 'RCPT TO' or 'MAIL FROM' command over a network connection to the vulnerable SMTP server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable SMTP server, typically over a network connection. No special privileges or prior authentication is required."
