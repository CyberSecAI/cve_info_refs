    {

      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication bypass due to insufficient checks."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrator access to the application.",

        "By manipulating the `en_login_id` parameter in the URL."

       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to access the vulnerable `admin.php` file with a manipulated `en_login_id` parameter."
      ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the application only checks if `$admin[$en_login_id] == \"true\"` without verifying the login status. When `register_globals` is enabled, providing `en_login_id=0` bypasses the authentication. After bypassing the login, the attacker can modify `config2.php` to execute arbitrary code."
