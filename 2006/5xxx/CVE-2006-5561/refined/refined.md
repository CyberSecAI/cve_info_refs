  "CVE-2006-5561": {
    "Description": "The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in Discuz! 5.0.0 GBK, allowing for admin credential disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Discuz! handles user input in admincp.php, specifically within the 'recyclebin' action. The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data passed through the 'cdb_auth' cookie, which is then directly used in an SQL query. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Insufficient Input Sanitization",
        "Direct use of unsanitized input in SQL queries"
      ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including the administrative user's password hash, security question, and user ID. This information can be used to gain complete control of the affected application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable admincp.php page. The malicious SQL injection payload is embedded within the 'cdb_auth' cookie.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Discuz! application. They also need knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (admincp.php) and the vulnerable cookie parameter (cdb_auth).  The attacker also needs to have knowledge of the application's authentication mechanism to forge the required cookies to reach the vulnerable code."
