Dorkfire.com Security Advisory
Discovered By: vooduhal (at) gmail (dot) com [email concealed]
Type of problem: Directory Traversal
Software: TorrentFlux 2.1
Software Description: TorrentFlux is a FREE PHP based Torrent client
that runs on a web server. Manage all of your Torrent downloads
through a convenient web interface from anywhere.
Problem description:
The dir.php script doesn't properly sanitize path passed via the "dir"
GET variable and also doesn't confirm where it's currently creating a
directory list for.
Example:
http://target/torrentfluxroot/dir.php?dir=../../../etc/
will produce a directory list of /etc/
