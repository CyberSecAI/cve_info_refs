```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `dir.php` script in TorrentFlux 2.1 does not properly sanitize the path passed via the `dir` GET variable and does not validate the location of directory listings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can list the contents of arbitrary directories on the server file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `dir.php` with a `dir` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../etc/`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No authentication is required."
