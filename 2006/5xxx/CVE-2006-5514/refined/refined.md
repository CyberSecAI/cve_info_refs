```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed to the "qzid" parameter in the quiz.php file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database, leading to potential data exfiltration (e.g. usernames, passwords, emails) and further compromise of the application.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'qzid' parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable quiz.php script. The attacker needs to log in to access quiz.php.
