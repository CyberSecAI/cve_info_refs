{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient bounds checking in the `localtime_r()` and related functions within the HP-UX libc when handling the `TZ` environment variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation to root by exploiting a vulnerable suid or sgid program.",
  "Attack vectors": "The `TZ` environment variable is manipulated to cause a buffer overflow in `localtime_r()` or related functions. Any suid or sgid program that utilizes these functions is a potential attack vector. In this specific exploit, the `su` binary is used.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the vulnerable HP-UX system. The attacker needs the ability to execute programs and manipulate environment variables."
