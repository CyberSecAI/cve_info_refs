The provided content is related to CVE-2006-5205. It describes an exploit for Invision Gallery 2.0.7 that leverages both a `readfile()` vulnerability and an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **`readfile()` vulnerability:** The application uses user-supplied input within a `readfile()` function without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Unsanitized user input passed to `readfile()` function.
*   Lack of proper input validation in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **`readfile()` vulnerability:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data from the database, or modify the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **`readfile()` vulnerability:** HTTP GET requests with specific parameters are used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET requests with manipulated parameters that bypass sanitization and alter SQL queries are used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No special position or authentication is required for the `readfile()` exploit.
*   For the SQL Injection, the attacker needs to know the table and column names, as well as the database prefix or to be able to obtain this using the `getprefix` functionality.
