- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `yesno.phtml` script in VAMP Webmail allows remote file inclusion through the `no_url` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a remote file, potentially containing malicious code, which is then executed by the web server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to `yesno.phtml` with a malicious URL as the value for the `no_url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need any prior authentication or special permissions.
