Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `/highlight/index.html` script of Verity Ultraseek. This script is used to highlight search terms on spidered pages.
*   The script improperly handles user-provided parameters allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs, leading to the ability to retrieve content from those URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted URL Parameter Handling:** The `/highlight/index.html` script doesn't properly validate or restrict the URLs provided as parameters. This enables attackers to make the server fetch content from arbitrary URLs.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The application exposes numerous scripts that allow for information disclosure, such as `/help/urlstatusgo.html`, `/help/header.html`, `/help/footer.html`, and others.
* **Arbitrary File Retrieval (Authenticated):** Authenticated users can retrieve arbitrary files from the server via the `/admin/logfile.txt` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Web Proxying:** Attackers can use the vulnerable Ultraseek server as a proxy to make web requests to other servers, both internal and external.
*   **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal network addresses and open ports by leveraging the vulnerable server as a proxy.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The ability to inject arbitrary content can lead to XSS attacks against users of the vulnerable application.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Various scripts expose potentially sensitive information about the application and its configuration.
*  **Arbitrary File Retrieval:** Authenticated users can retrieve sensitive files using the `/admin/logfile.txt` script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The primary vulnerability in `/highlight/index.html` can be exploited remotely without requiring any authentication.
*   **Direct Script Access:** Attackers can directly access the `/highlight/index.html` script by crafting specific URLs and passing malicious parameters.
*   **Exploiting exposed scripts:** Various information disclosure vulnerabilities can be accessed remotely through specific script URLs.
* **Authenticated access:** Authenticated users can access the `/admin/logfile.txt` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Ultraseek server.
*   **No Authentication Required (for primary vulnerability):** Exploitation of the core proxying issue does not require authentication.
*   **Authentication Required (for file retrieval):** Exploitation of the arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability requires valid user authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Verity on 2006-05-09, and a coordinated public release occurred on 2006-11-15.
*   Verity has released an update to address the vulnerability.
* The default configuration of Ultraseek was changed to restrict in-document highlighting to the current domain or the collection URL filters in version 5.7.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter.

**Summary of Changes in Ultraseek 5.7:**
* The default filters for document highlighting were made more restrictive. This means that, by default, the highlighting features would only be allowed for the server's domain name or the collection URL filters.
