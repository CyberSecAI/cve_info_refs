```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a variable `$pn_lang` in include statements without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the path of the included file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `pn_lang` parameter in the HTTP GET request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a remote server hosting the malicious file."
