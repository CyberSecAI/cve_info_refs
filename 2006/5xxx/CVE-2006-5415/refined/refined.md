{
  "CVE-2006-5415": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a failure in the 'functions_newshr.php' script to properly sanitize the 'phpbb_root_path' parameter. This allows for remote file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'functions_newshr.php' script, providing a malicious URL in the 'phpbb_root_path' parameter.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the server and have a malicious script hosted on a remote server that they control. The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability."
