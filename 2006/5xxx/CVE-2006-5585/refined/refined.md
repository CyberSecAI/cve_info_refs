Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-5585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper processing and management of file manifests by the Client-Server Run-time Subsystem (Csrss). Specifically, the issue lies in how Csrss validates embedded file manifests before passing data to the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Manifest Corruption:** The core weakness is the possibility of corrupting or manipulating file manifests in a way that allows for unintended code execution or privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow a local user to gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights
- This effectively leads to a privilege elevation, where a standard user can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:**  An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and must be able to log on locally to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An attacker needs to have valid user credentials on the target machine.
- **Ability to Run Programs:** The attacker needs to be able to execute programs on the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was privately identified and not publicly disclosed before the release of the security update.
- The security update modifies the way that the Client Server Run-time Subsystem validates embedded file manifests, correcting the improper processing issue.
- The vulnerability is present in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003, but not in later service packs or OS versions.
- Microsoft recommends that users apply the patch as soon as possible.
