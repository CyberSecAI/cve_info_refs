      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated attacker.",
        "details": "The affected code is reused by several Netmail services including SMTP, POP, IMAP, HTTP and the proprietary NMAP, making each of these services vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow."

       "root_cause": "The HTTP Protocol Stack in Novell eDirectory iMonitor fails to check the length of client-supplied HTTP Host request-header values before using them to build a formatted URL into a statically-sized buffer on the stack. Specifically, the `snprintf()` function uses the length parameter to specify the number of bytes to copy from the Host request-header, without verifying if the destination buffer is large enough.",

        "Stack-based buffer overflow"

       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
         "HTTP GET/POST/HEAD requests to paths like `/nds` and `/dhost`"

      "required_capabilities": "Remote unauthenticated attacker.",
         "details": "The overflow is triggered in a call to `snprintf()` while preparing an HTTP redirect response. The vulnerability can be triggered before any authentication takes place."

      "source": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_a70b5db9_20250125_062953.html",
