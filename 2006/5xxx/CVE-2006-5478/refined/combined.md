| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Netmail. Exploitation does not require authentication.  The specific flaw exists within the user authentication component of Novell Netmail. The routine responsible for authenticating Netmail users lacks adequate bounds checking when processing a username containing one or more period (.) characters. The affected code is reused by several Netmail services including SMTP, POP, IMAP, HTTP and the proprietary NMAP. Each of these services is vulnerable to an exploitable stack-based buffer overflow. |

Novell eDirectory/iMonitor Remote Code
Execution Security Advisory

08-Sept-2006

  Summary

Novell’s HTTP Protocol Stack (httpstk) is a component of iMonitor which provides a web-
based interface for management of eDirectory, an LDAP service forming the basis for many
of the world’s largest identity-management deployments. The code fails to check the length
of client-supplied HTTP Host request-header (e.g. Host: www.host.com) values before using
them to build a formatted URL into an inadequate, statically-sized buffer on the stack. This
condition  occurs  in  a  call  to  snprintf()  while  the  server  is  preparing  an  HTTP  redirect
response and can be triggered remotely, before any authentication takes place.

  Affected Software

This vulnerability has been confirmed to exist in the following products and corresponding
platforms. For additional information, see Novell’s website.

  Impact

this is NT_AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on Windows and root on Linux and Solaris.

  Details – C++ Pseudo Code

The  vulnerable  function’s  logic  was  examined,  and  the  general  structure  of  the  code,
depicted in the C++ language, is presented in this section. This code mimics the functions’
behavior as accurately as possible in order to illuminate the vulnerability; however, it is only a
modest representation of the original source.

The  BuildRedirectURL()  method  calls  snprintf()  in  order  to  store  the  user-supplied  HTTP
Host request-header value into a 64-byte buffer.  The assumed intention of this code is to
redirect  the  client  to  a  valid  URL  on  the  host  that  was  specified  in  the  request.    Under
correct circumstances, snprintf()’s length parameter is set to the maximum number of bytes
the destination buffer can hold.  However, this code utilized the length parameter in order to
specify  the  number  of  bytes  to  copy  from  the  Host  request-header  value,  regardless  of
whether  or  not  the  destination  buffer  is  capable  of  holding  it.    Therefore,  a  malicious
individual  may  specify  a  Host  request-header  value  exceeding  64  bytes,  causing  a  standard
stack-based buffer overflow.

  Details - Disassembly

The  following  disassembly  of  httpstk.dlm  for  Windows,  version  201.14.24.0,  depicts  this
vulnerability.

HRequest::SendRedirectRsp:

.text:62407079  lea     eax, [ebp+request_url]
.text:6240707C  mov     ecx, esi
.text:6240707E  test    bl, bl
.text:62407080  push    eax
.text:62407081  setz    al
.text:62407084  push    eax
.text:62407085  push    [ebp+stackid]
.text:62407088  call    HRequest::BuildRequestURL

HRequest::BuildRedirectURL:

.text:62406EF0  push    [ebp+szHostHdrValue]
.text:62406EF3  mov     esi, eax
.text:62406EF5  add     esi, dword ptr [ebp+request_url]
.text:62406EF8  lea     eax, [edi+1]
.text:62406EFB  push    offset aS_3
.text:62406F00  push    eax
.text:62406F01  push    esi
.text:62406F02  call    ds:_snprintf

  Exploit Design

The stack overflow can be triggered with a GET, POST, or HEAD request to a path on the
server  that  produces  an  HTTP  302  redirect  response  (mainly  /nds  and  /dhost),  when
accompanied by an overly-long Host request-header value. By examining the stack segment
around the vulnerable function, one can locate and overwrite the return address (Linux) or
structured exception handlers (Windows) to gain control of execution. When exploiting this
vulnerability,  the  shell  code  should  be  optimized  to  not  contain  NULL  bytes,  colons,
carriage returns, or line feeds.

A  proof-of-concept  exploit  has  been  developed  that  will  reliably  exploit  all  versions  of
eDirectory  on  both  Windows  and  Linux,  without  the  need  of  fingerprinting.   This  was
accomplished by using SEH overwrites and saved-instruction-pointer overwrites at the same
time.

The  vulnerability’s  existence  may  be  determined  by  sending  an  overly-long  HTTP  Host-
header value containing a colon in the first few bytes.  Versions that are not vulnerable will
send  a  redirect  containing  an  IP  address,  whereas  versions  that  are  vulnerable  will  send  a
redirect  containing  the  initial  bytes  before  the  colon.   Furthermore,  a  web  request  to  an

Page 5

invalid  resource  (e.g.  http://host/an_invalid_resource)  will  result  in  an  error  page  being
returned.   This  error  page  has  been  found  to  be  variable  depending  on  the  version  of
eDirectory that is installed.

  Defense

The  following  Snort  rules  can  assist  in  the  detection  or  prevention  of  attacks  against
vulnerable  systems,  however  limitations  exist  and  they  should  never  be  used  in  lieu  of
patching.  False  negatives  may  be  high  if  certain  evasion  techniques  are  implemented,
including  the  use  of  non-standard  white  space  and/or  carriage  returns.  Additionally,  it  is
possible to exploit vulnerable systems over the HttpStk SSL listener (if enabled), and this will
go undetected by these rules.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
