Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of upload filtering in the Speedwiki 2.0 CMS. Specifically, the `upload.php` script does not validate the type or content of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The most critical vulnerability is the ability for an authenticated user to upload any type of file, including malicious PHP scripts, due to the missing upload filter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS through the `showRevisions` parameter in `index.php`. Specifically, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `showRevisions` parameter.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the full path of the web server due to vulnerabilities in  `index.php` when using the `showRevisions` and `searchText` parameters and in `upload.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS can allow an attacker to steal user session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Full path disclosure can help an attacker gain insights into the server's file system structure, aiding in further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An authenticated user can upload a malicious PHP script via the upload functionality found at `/speedywiki/index.php?upload=1`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL such as `/index.php?showRevisions=</textarea>'"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` and tricking a user into clicking it.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker can trigger the path disclosure by accessing `/speedywiki/index.php?showRevisions[]`, `/speedywiki/index.php?searchText[]`, or `/speedywiki/upload.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Requires an authenticated user account on the Speedwiki system.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Requires the ability to entice a user to click on a crafted URL.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Requires the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application URLs.
