{
  "CVE-2006-5850": {
    "Description": "The Essentia Web Server 2.15 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow, triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request with an overly long URI.",
    "Root cause": "The web server does not properly validate the length of the URI in a GET request, leading to a buffer overflow.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server, leading to complete system compromise. A less severe impact is a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the web server with an overly long URI."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a network request to the web server, implying a remote attacker. The attack complexity is low and no authentication is required."
