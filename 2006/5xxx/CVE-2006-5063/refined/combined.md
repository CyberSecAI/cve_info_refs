How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : elog
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-5063 CVE-2006-5790 CVE-2006-5791 CVE-2006-6318

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in elog, a web-based
electronic logbook, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2006-5063

    Tilman Koschnick discovered that log entry editing in HTML is vulnerable
    to cross-site scripting. This update disables the vulnerable code.

CVE-2006-5790

    Ulf Harnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered several
    format string vulnerabilities in elog, which may lead to execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-5791

    Ulf Harnhammar of the Debian Security Audit Project discovered
    cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the creation of new logbook
    entries.

CVE-2006-6318

    Jayesh KS and Arun Kethipelly of OS2A discovered that elog performs
    insufficient error handling in config file parsing, which may lead to
    denial of service through a NULL pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge3.

The upcoming stable distribution (etch) will no longer include elog.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2+r1754-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your elog package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

```
Package: elog
Version: 2.6.1+r1642-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

when editing a log entry in HTML mode, elog accepts arbitrary JavaScript
code. This code will be executed in the browser of other users viewing the
entry (provided they have JavaScript enabled), thus exposing the users
to a XSS (cross site scripting) attack.

To reproduce the problem, add or edit a log entry, switch to HTML mode
and enter the following code snippet:

--------------------------------8<------------------------------
<script type='text/javascript'>
<!--
  alert("There seems to be the possibility of an XSS attack...");
//-->
</script>
--------------------------------8<------------------------------

When viewing the entry, a JavaScript Popup should appear.

To remedy the problem, all <script> tags should be filtered out (or
better yet, only "safe" HTML code should be allowed). At the very least,
it should be possible to disable HTML entries (and this should be the
default, with a big warning if someone wants to change it).

Cheers, Til

The reported XSS vulnerability has been fixed in SVN revision 1719 of
elog by not allowing HTML mode by default. This mode has to be enabled
explicitly by setting "Allowed encoding = 7".

Hi,

Thanks for your bug report.  I'm going to make a new upload (r1719) which

Hi Stefan,

Thanks for the fix!  I haven't checked the stable version.  Does this issue
also exist in our stable version (release 2.5.7, svn revision: r1558)?  If
so, we should prepare a backport for it.

Cheers,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
