Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability in the `calcul-page.php` script of patchlodel-0.7.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files via the `home` parameter in the `calcul-page.php` script. This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This could lead to complete compromise of the web server and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `calcul-page.php` script, using the vulnerable `home` parameter to specify the URL of the malicious script to include.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `patchlodel-0.7.3` software. The attacker also needs a publicly available web server to host their malicious script that will be included.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**
The content describes a Remote File Include vulnerability in the `calcul-page.php` file of patchlodel-0.7.3.  This vulnerability arises due to the failure to validate user input passed through the `home` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject a URL to a remote file that is then included and executed. This could result in arbitrary code execution on the server.
