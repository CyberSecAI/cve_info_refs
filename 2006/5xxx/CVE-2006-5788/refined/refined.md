  "CVE-2006-5788": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "iPrimal Forums is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The 'p' parameter in the '/admin/index.php' script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file by supplying a URL. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of the `include()` function in the `/admin/index.php` script. The script takes the value of the `p` parameter from the URL and directly includes a file using that value.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary code by including a malicious file from a remote server. This can lead to complete server compromise, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/index.php` script with the `p` parameter set to a malicious URL."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They also need to have access to a server where they can host the malicious file that they intend to include. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
