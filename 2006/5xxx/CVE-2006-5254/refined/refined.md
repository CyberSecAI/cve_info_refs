{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `registration_detailed.inc.php` file of the Mambo component `com_registration_detailed`, where the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is used in an `include_once` statement without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include a remote file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server on the vulnerable Mambo installation. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activity.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `registration_detailed.inc.php` file, with a crafted `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter pointing to a malicious PHP file on an attacker-controlled server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mambo application. The attacker also needs to host a malicious PHP file on a web server accessible by the vulnerable application."
