Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `$GLOBALS['lib']['db']['path']` array not being properly declared within the ZoomStats application. This allows for the injection of a remote file path into the `mysql.php` file via the vulnerable parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a remote file inclusion, where an attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server into the application.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input provided through the `GLOBALS['lib']['db']['path']` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary remote URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP script. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
- **Data Theft/Modification:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or modify application data by injecting malicious code.
- **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, the injected code could be designed to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `mysql.php` file. The malicious URL is injected through the `GLOBALS['lib']['db']['path']` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ZoomStats application.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable parameter (`GLOBALS['lib']['db']['path']`).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example shows how to inject a remote shell by setting `GLOBALS['lib']['db']['path']` to a URL containing the attacker's shell.
- The vulnerability is present in the `/libs/dbmax/mysql.php` file.
