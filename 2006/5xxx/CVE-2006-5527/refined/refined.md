  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file via the `sys_path` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `lib.editor.inc.php` file and providing a malicious URL through the `sys_path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make an HTTP request to the vulnerable server and must have a web server hosting the malicious file."
