{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the SAP 'enserver.exe' which allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, logs containing passwords, and other confidential data. This can lead to further compromise of the system or network.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out via network by sending crafted TCP packets to the SAP server. The attacker must know the target server's IP address and the port number of the 'enserver.exe' service (usually TCP/3200+SYSNR).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the SAP server. They must know the server's IP address, the port number of the service, and the path of the file they wish to download."
