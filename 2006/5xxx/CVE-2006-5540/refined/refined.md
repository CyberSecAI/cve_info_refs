{
  "CVE-2006-5540": {
    "description": "A crash was reported when using aggregate functions in UPDATE statements. A local authenticated attacker could exploit this to crash the server backend. This update disables this construct, since it is not very well defined and forbidden by the SQL standard.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of aggregate functions in UPDATE statements during 'MIN/MAX index optimization'.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Server crash (daemon crash), leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "Local authenticated users.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a local user account with privileges to execute SQL queries, specifically UPDATE statements using aggregate functions.",
    "details": "The vulnerability lies in the `backend/parser/analyze.c` file of PostgreSQL versions 8.1.x, specifically how it handles aggregate functions within an UPDATE statement. This improper handling can lead to a server crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of SQL command using aggregate functions within an UPDATE statement, which causes a crash due to improper MIN/MAX index optimization. The fix disables the construct, as it violates SQL standards."
