# USN-369-2: postgresql-8.1 vulnerabilities

1 November 2006

postgresql-8.1 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)

## Details

USN-369-1 fixed three minor PostgreSQL 8.1 vulnerabilities for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 6.10.

Original advisory details:

Michael Fuhr discovered an incorrect type check when handling unknown

literals. By attempting to coerce such a literal to the ANYARRAY type,

a local authenticated attacker could cause a server crash. ([CVE-2006-5541](/security/CVE-2006-5541))

Josh Drake and Alvaro Herrera reported a crash when using aggregate

functions in UPDATE statements. A local authenticated attacker could

exploit this to crash the server backend. This update disables this

construct, since it is not very well defined and forbidden by the SQL

standard. ([CVE-2006-5540](/security/CVE-2006-5540))

Sergey Koposov discovered a flaw in the duration logging. This could

cause a server crash under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2006-5542](/security/CVE-2006-5542))

Please note that these flaws can usually not be exploited through web

and other applications that use a database and are exposed to

untrusted input, so these flaws do not pose a threat in usual setups.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* postgresql-8.1
  -
  8.1.4-7ubuntu0.1

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

postgresql security update (RHSA-2007-0067)

Original Release Date: March 19, 2007

Last Revised: February 13, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-117

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database system.

PostgreSQL was found to contain two vulnerabilities in its processing
of SQL
functions. An authenticated user with permissions to add and drop
database
tables could potentially exploit these issues to cause the PostgreSQL
server
process to crash or possibly read data frorm arbitrary memory locations.
The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the names
[CVE-2007-0555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0555) and
[CVE-2007-0556](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0556) to these issues.

Multiple bugs were found in PostgreSQL that could lead to a Denial of
Service
(DOS) condition. If specific types of SQL commands were used by an
authenticated
user, it could potentially cause the PostgreSQL server process to crash.
The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-5540](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5540),
[CVE-2006-5541](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5541) and
[CVE-2006-5542](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5542) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0067.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with postgresql installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0, 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.0 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of postgresql, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as the upgrade and can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and
then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-369-1: PostgreSQL vulnerabilities

25 October 2006

PostgreSQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Michael Fuhr discovered an incorrect type check when handling unknown

literals. By attempting to coerce such a literal to the ANYARRAY type,

a local authenticated attacker could cause a server crash.

Josh Drake and Alvaro Herrera reported a crash when using aggregate

functions in UPDATE statements. A local authenticated attacker could

exploit this to crash the server backend. This update disables this

construct, since it is not very well defined and forbidden by the SQL

standard.

Sergey Koposov discovered a flaw in the duration logging. This could

cause a server crash under certain circumstances.

Please note that these flaws can usually not be exploited through web

and other applications that use a database and are exposed to

untrusted input, so these flaws do not pose a threat in usual setups.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* postgresql-8.1
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1.1

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.
