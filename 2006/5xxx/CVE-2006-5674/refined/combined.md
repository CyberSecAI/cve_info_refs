|  | Security Vulnerability... yet another sad story with register\_globals set to ON in php.ini |  |

| Recently discovered vulnerability, again, is related to the hosting servers, which have register\_globals setting turned ON in php.ini. Despite I agree it's our fault this error appeared in the latest release, most importantly it means you have a very insecure hosting, when having turned this on.Read more info on PHP site:<http://php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php>Issue to solve is top paste at the very top of each of these files:bb\_func\_forums.phpbb\_func\_txt.phpbb\_functions.phpthe following line:**if (!defined('INCLUDED776')) die ('Fatal error.');** these files are updated in the freshly issued [updated package](https://www.minibb.com/download.php?file=minibb20).*Everybody still is recommended* to do this short upgrade. | |

| **krko**Download the latest version of RSS addon from Downloads section. It has been updated already to be compliant with the latest miniBB release. Also as 1st page news addon has been updated, too.Actually this line of code should appear in any addon using mentioned updated scripts:define ('INCLUDED776',1); | |

| **Krko**Do you have the latest setup\_mysql.php file in your forum folder?My RSS feed was also broken until I included just that file itself along with the other one (setup\_[insert the name of your database here].php). | |

| *Actually this line of code should appear in any addon using mentioned updated scripts:define ('INCLUDED776',1);*Where should it be? At the very top?What about file upload and private messaging plugin? Do they need to be updated? | |

| *At the very top?* - yes.Addons do not contain this hole, they all are already secured... thus remember - they are not publically distributed. | |

| **Karel II****This is bogus**, about 5-10 lines above it includes a file which declares $pathToFiles.*include ('./setup\_options.php');* | |
