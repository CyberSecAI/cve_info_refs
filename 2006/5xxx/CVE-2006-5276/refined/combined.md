##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Snort: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200703-01**

The Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor contains a buffer overflow that could result
in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/snort** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.6.1.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.6.1.3** |

### Background

Snort is a widely deployed intrusion detection program.

### Description

The Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor does not properly reassemble certain
types of fragmented SMB and DCE/RPC packets.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted fragmented SMB or
DCE/RPC packets, without the need to finish the TCP handshake, that
would trigger a stack-based buffer overflow while being reassembled.
This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions
of the user running the Snort preprocessor.

### Workaround

Disable the DCE/RPC processor by commenting the 'preprocessor dcerpc'
section in /etc/snort/snort.conf .

### Resolution

All Snort users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/snort-2.6.1.3"
```

## Sourcefire Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor does not properly reassemble fragmented packets

#### Vulnerability Note VU#196240

Original Release Date: 2007-02-19 | Last Revised: 2008-01-30

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Sourcefire Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Sourcefire Snort is a widely-deployed, open-source network intrusion detection system (IDS). Snort and its components are used in other IDS products, notably Sourcefire, and Snort is included with a number of operating system distributions.Snort preprocessors are modular plugins that extend functionality by operating on packets before the detection engine is run. The [DCE/RPC](http://www.snort.org/docs/snort_htmanuals/htmanual_261/node104.html) preprocessor reassembles fragmented SMB and DCE/RPC packets so that Snort rules operate on a complete packet. The preprocessor does not properly reassemble SMB Write AndX commands, creating a stack buffer overflow vulnerability.  The DCE/RPC preprocessor is enabled by default and dynamically detects SMB traffic. An attacker does not have to complete a full TCP connection to exploit this vulnerability. According to [ISS](http://www.iss.net/threats/257.html):*This vulnerability is in a dynamic-preprocessor enabled in the default configuration, and the configuration for this preprocessor allows for auto-recognition of SMB traffic to perform reassembly on. No checks are performed to see if the traffic is part of a valid TCP session, and multiple Write AndX requests can be chained in the same TCP segment. As a result, an attacker can exploit this overflow with a single TCP PDU sent across a network monitored by Snort or Sourcefire.*Note that this issue affects the following systems:     + Snort 2.6.1, 2.6.1.1, and 2.6.1.2 + Snort 2.7.0 beta 1 + Sourcefire Intrusion Sensors versions 4.1.x, 4.5.x, and 4.6.x with SEUs prior to SEU 64 + Sourcefire Intrusion Sensor Software for Crossbeam versions 4.1.x, 4.5.x and 4.6.x with SEUs prior to SEU 64  Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available.This vulnerability occurred as a result of violating rule [ARR33-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/ARR33-C.%2BGuarantee%2Bthat%2Bcopies%2Bare%2Bmade%2Binto%2Bstorage%2Bof%2Bsufficient%2Bsize) of the CERT Secure Coding Standard. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privilege level of the Snort preprocessor. In most cases this would allow an attacker to compromise the system running Snort. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Sourcefire has released Snort [2.6.1.3](http://www.snort.org/docs/release_notes/release_notes_2613.txt) which is available from the Snort [download](http://www.snort.org/dl/) site. See Snort document [2007-02-19](http://www.snort.org/docs/advisory-2007-02-19.html) for more details. Sourcefire customers should see [Sourcefire Support Login](https://support.sourcefire.com/) for more details on updates. |
| --- |

| **Disable the preprocessor**  Disable the DCE/RPC preprocessor (dcerpc) by removing the DCE/RPC preprocessor directives from the configuration file (often /etc/snort.conf or user.conf). Note that disabling this preprocessor may allow fragmented attacks to evade the Snort sensor. See Sourcefire Advisory [2007-02-19](http://www.snort.org/docs/advisory-2007-02-19.html) for more details. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=229265#c0)  Dennis Gilmore    2007-02-19 20:32:16 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Sourcefire has learned of a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the Snort  DCE/RPC preprocessor. This preprocessor is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer  overflow that could potentially allow attackers to execute code with the same  privileges as the Snort binary. Sourcefire has prepared updates for Snort  open-source software to address this issue.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Snort Versions Affected:      * Snort 2.6.1, 2.6.1.1, and 2.6.1.2     * Snort 2.7.0 beta 1  How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=229265#c1)  Fedora Update System    2007-09-07 17:20:22 UTC  ``` snort-2.7.0.1-3.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
