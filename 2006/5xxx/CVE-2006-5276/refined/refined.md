{
  "CVE-2006-5276": {
    "Description": "The Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor does not properly reassemble fragmented SMB and DCE/RPC packets, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of fragmented SMB and DCE/RPC packets by the Snort DCE/RPC preprocessor during reassembly.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the Snort preprocessor, potentially compromising the system running Snort. Can also lead to denial of service due to crashes.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted fragmented SMB or DCE/RPC packets.",
        "Exploitation can occur without completing a full TCP handshake."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of Snort with the DCE/RPC preprocessor enabled.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is in a dynamically enabled preprocessor that auto-recognizes SMB traffic and does not perform checks to ensure traffic is part of a valid TCP session. Multiple 'Write AndX' requests can be chained in the same TCP segment. Exploit code is publicly available."
