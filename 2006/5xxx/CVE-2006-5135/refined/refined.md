  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-controlled parameters without proper sanitization, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters such as `open_box`, `middle_box`, `close_box`, `navigation_start`, `navigation_middle`, `navigation_end`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have access to a remote server hosting the malicious code."
