  "CVE-2006-5521": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `phpdns_basedir` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include remote files.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes files based on the user-controlled `phpdns_basedir` parameter.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially executing malicious code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `phpdns_basedir` parameter in the HTTP request.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files using a user-controlled variable `phpdns_basedir` without proper sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete server compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that specifies a remote file URL in the `phpdns_basedir` parameter.",
