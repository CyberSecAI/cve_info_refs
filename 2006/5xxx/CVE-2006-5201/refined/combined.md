How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A) Use an alternate login mechanism such as dtlogin(1) or if using Solaris
10, gdm(1).

or:

B) Modify the xdm(1) configuration file, xdm-config, and create a new
Xsession file using the following commands as the root user:

**# cd /usr/openwin/lib/X11/xdm

# mv xdm-config xdm-config.orig

# sed -e 's/cp \/dev\/null "$errfile"/umask 077 \&\& cp \/dev\/null
"$errfile"/' Xsession > /etc/X11/Xsession

# sed -e 's/\/usr\/openwin\/lib\/X11\/xdm\/Xsession/\/etc\/X11\/Xsession/'
xdm-config.orig > xdm-config**

then restore executable permissions to the file by running the following
command:

## Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle signatures

#### Vulnerability Note VU#845620

Original Release Date: 2006-09-11 | Last Revised: 2007-02-08

---

### Overview

Multiple RSA implementations fail to properly handle RSA signatures. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to forge RSA signatures.

### Description

| RSA signatures are used to authenticate the source of a message. To prevent RSA signatures from being forged, messages are padded with data to ensure message hashes are adequately sized. One such padding scheme is specified in the Public-Key Cryptography Standard #1 (PKCS-1), which is defined in RFC [3447](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt).  Many RSA implementations may fail to properly verify signatures. Specifically, the verifier may incorrectly parse PKCS-1 padded signatures, ignoring data at the end of a signature. If this data is ignored and a RSA key with a public exponent of three is used, it may be possible to forge the signing key's signature.Note that any application that uses RSA signatures may be affected by this vulnerability. This includes, but is not limited to, SSH, SSL, PGP, and X.509 applications. This issue is further discussed on the [ietf-openpgp](http://www.imc.org/ietf-openpgp/mail-archive/msg14307.html) mailing list. |

### [F-Secure Corporation](#MIMG-6TFMRF) Not Affected

Notified:  September 08, 2006  Updated: October 04, 2006

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

F-Secure antivirus products are not vulnerable. The list of non-vulnerable products includes F-Secure Anti-Virus, F-Secure Internet Security, F-Secure Client Security, F-Secure Server Security, F-Secure Mobile Security, F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway, F-Secure Network Control, and all other products in F-Secure small business and corporate suites, also listed at <http://www.f-secure.com/enterprises/products/>.

F-Secure VPN+ versions up to version 6.12 are vulnerable in installations that use PKI CA issued certificates, which use third-party generated keys. The RSA key generator in F-Secure products has never allowed the generation of RSA keys with a public exponent of 3. This means that keys created with F-Secure tools cannot be used to mount an attack against F-Secure products or other systems.

The F-Secure SSH product line is exclusively distributed by Attachmate under the Reflection for Secure IT brand. Please see the vendor statement from Attachmate for more information.

### [PuTTY](#MIMG-6TFMY9) Not Affected

Notified:  September 08, 2006  Updated: September 11, 2006

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

I do not believe that any program in the PuTTY suite is, or has ever been, vulnerable to this attack.

The RSA verification code is in the function rsa2\_verifysig() in our source file sshrsa.c, and a quick inspection shows clearly that it rigorously enforces that the ASN.1 data and hash value must be at the very bottom of the PKCS#1 padded integer.

For good measure, our RSA key generator does not, and has never, generated keys with an exponent of 3. (This has nothing to do with whether we're vulnerable to the attack itself, of course, but it does mean we are also not generating keys which can be abused to mount the attack against other systems.)

### [Cryptlib](#MIMG-6TDHXM) Unknown

Notified:  September 06, 2006  Updated: September 18, 2006

### Status

Unknown

### Vendor Statement

Although cryptlib shouldn't be vulnerable to the original Bleichenbacher attack, there is ongoing discussion about further attacks that affect any RSA keys with e=3. Because the security community currently doesn't know how serious the problem is, cryptlib users should disable the use of any RSA keys with e=3 by changing the check 'if( BN\_get\_word( e ) < 3 )' in initCheckRSAkey() in context/kg\_rsa.c to 'if( BN\_get\_word( e ) < 17 )'. Note that this will disable the use of a small number of existing keys that use e=3 (although cryptlib itself will never generate or use private keys with this

value), but until the exact nature of the problem is fully understood this is the only safe fix.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
