How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Additional information will be added soon.   With this CPU Oracle has fixed 101 security bugs in various products and components:   The Oracle database patches are fixing 10 Oracle Spatial, 6 Change Data Capture, 3 XMLDB, 2 Database Core and 1 database Scheduler.   Oracle fixed some really old cross site scripting bugs in Oracle Reports. Finally Oracle fixed these reports vulnerbilities after 1056 (!!!) days. It seems that Oracle is now fixing also old bugs.   The analysis of the 35 APEX/HTMLDB security vulnerabilities shows that most of the vulnerabilities were already fixed with earlier versions (e.g. 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2). The Upgrade to 2.2.1 contains only a few security fixes (see section APEX in this analysis).   | Database | 22 | | --- | --- | | OHS | 8 | | APEX | 35 | | OAS | 14 | | OCS | 12 | | APPS | 21 | | OPA |

items after upgrading to Apex 2.2.1The following table shows a report and analysis (using Repscan and a PL/SQL Unwrapper) of the modified database objects after upgrading to Apex 2.2.1. It seems that most of the 35 security bugs were already fixed with older versions of HTMLDB/APEX. Especially if your are using an older version (< 2.1) of APEX/HTMLDB it is highly recommended to upgrade to 2.2.1. Keep in mind that only 2.2.0 is only running on Oracle Express Edition or 10.2.0.3.  | **Modification type** | **Owner** | **Type** | **Name** | **new MD5-checksum** | Security | Modification | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | FUNCTION | WWV\_FLOWS\_RELEASE | 0e04aa3b11d13b3817f41fb71f089ee1 | No | Reduce length of deinstall\_script to 30000 | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_EXECUTE\_IMMEDIATE | d93b2bb92815f13dcb7a2c717e895783 | No | Exception added | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW | 8ffb3b9030a0ec53ede8d2c1c223d03b | No |  | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_CALENDAR3 | 34bc685b5819d33c1a8fd3f4a91712b2 | No |  | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_COPY\_PAGE | a923bbe09bc172083a32f08152d6d1be | No | Procedure list, get\_sc\_name modified | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_DISP\_PAGE\_PLUGS | 485a2fb6ea8510d7302c66c1308ce648 | No | Procedure populate\_plug\_query\_info modified | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_DML | 7b17c81a2886ccd7dcceb3024ab5f194 | No | Procedure fetch\_row, insert\_row modified | | added | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_DYNSQL\_PARSE | 89ef494debb9223255f9c53d1da220ab | No |  | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_DYNSQL\_UTIL | 10db3f244d8f36cf6d04f09c4d1f791e | Yes? | Procedure run\_block/parse\_block\_vc2/parse\_block\_arr modified for Oracle XE/10.2.03 | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_F4000\_UTIL | d43915fe4a4659c71ebe67665e76e488 | No | Procedure copy\_list,copy\_list\_from\_app modified | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_FORMS | 4ba4d980eb07f75b0353601b8f41e3aa | Yes? | Procedure display\_positional\_form | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_GENERATE\_DDL | 4d2b6df9e376e088643009baa813077e | No | Change Foreign-Key-Handling in function get\_ddl | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_GEN\_API2 | 1d1d1e15e325802dbaf21a320a0be717 | No | Procedure create\_install modified from 32767 to 30000 | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_INSTALL\_WIZARD | 60e248d2e19fa73c2960e1d9cf44c195 | No | Procedure set\_sub\_strings modified | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_ITEM | 48248f419eef9a157085c3770d42e891 | No | Now support for timestamp added | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_ITEM\_HELP | 2f11e8cb2cffbc0bc9b262c7933ee065 | Yes | Procedure show\_help modified, Step\_id truncated | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_LOAD\_EXCEL\_DATA | 86763b4270e8af1d36b6896a6d7f278f | No | Procedure run\_ddl modified for Oracle XE/10.2.03 | | modified | FLOWS\_020200 | PACKAGE BODY | WWV\_FLOW\_REGION\_LAYOUT | 081704d87947175d8c57e15d01472106 | No | Procedure show\_page\_buttons modified.
