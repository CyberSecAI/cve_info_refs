{
  "CVE-2006-5841": {
    "Description": "The DodosMail application is vulnerable to a remote file inclusion vulnerability. This is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the dodosmail.php script. The application uses the $dodosmail_header_file and $dodosmail_footer_file variables without proper validation which allows an attacker to inject a remote file that will be included into the current script.",
    "Root cause": "The application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `dodosmail_header_file` and `dodosmail_footer_file` GET parameters in the `dodosmail.php` script.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a web request to the vulnerable server. They need to control a server with a malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable server."
