Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5957:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content from `attrition.org` directly references CVE-2006-5957, indicating it is relevant. The vendor dispute further specifies that the vulnerability is within the "infinicart" product, which is also mentioned in the `securityreason.com` content.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The primary vulnerability is **SQL Injection**. Specifically, the content indicates SQL injection vulnerabilities in the following parameters:
    *   `groupid` in `/infinicart-demo/browse_group.asp`
    *   `productid` in `/infinicart-demo/added_to_cart.asp`
    *   `catid` in `/infinicart-demo/browsesubcat.asp`
    *   `subid` in `/infinicart-demo/browsesubcat.asp`
*   The secondary vulnerability is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. This is present in the following POST parameters:
    *   `username` in `/infinicart-demo/login.asp`
    *   `passwd` in `/infinicart-demo/login.asp`
    *   `search` in `/infinicart-demo/search.asp`
    *   `email` in `/infinicart-demo/sendpassword.asp`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improperly sanitized input in GET parameters leads to SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of output encoding in POST parameters allows injection of malicious scripts into the application's responses.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
    *   The attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
    *   The attacker could potentially gain control of the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker could inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.
    *   The injected scripts could also be used to phish user credentials.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities by crafting malicious SQL queries via GET parameters.
*  **XSS:** Attackers can inject XSS payloads via POST parameters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **SQL Injection:** Requires the ability to send crafted GET requests to vulnerable web pages. No special privileges are required.
*   **XSS:** Requires the ability to submit crafted POST requests to vulnerable web pages. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vendor, Ecommercemax Solutions, claims that the vulnerabilities were only present in the demo version of the `infinicart` product and not in the official released product. This claim is disputed by the vulnerability reporters.
*   The `securityreason.com` content provides specific injection points for the SQLi and XSS attacks, offering more details than the vendor's response.

**Summary:**
This CVE involves SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities within the `infinicart` product. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the database, inject malicious scripts, and potentially compromise user accounts.
