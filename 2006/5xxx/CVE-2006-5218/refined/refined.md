- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the kernel component of systrace when handling large integer values in a systrace ioctl().
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer overflow in `systrace_preprepl` function, specifically in the calculation of `len`. The `len += repl->strr_offlen[i]` can overflow, as well as the sum `repl->strr_offlen[i] + repl->strr_off[i]`. This bypasses a sanity check of the length of replacement data.
    - Out-of-bounds write in `systrace_fname` function.  The attacker controls the `len` parameter, which is used to write a NULL byte at `strp->fname[strp->nfname][len - 1]`.  This allows writing a NULL byte to an attacker-controlled kernel address.
    - Information leak due to the use of attacker-controlled length parameter in `copyout` in `systrace_replace` to copy kernel memory to userspace, potentially revealing sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Local privilege escalation by writing NULL bytes to overwrite UID to get UID 0.
    - Local privilege escalation by writing NULL bytes over the securelevel storage.
    - Information disclosure by reading chunks of kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by using a crafted `systrace ioctl()`.
    - Attackers need to supply large integer values for `strr_offlen` and `strr_off` parameters in the `ioctl`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local access to the system to call the vulnerable `ioctl`.
    - Ability to execute code on the target system.
