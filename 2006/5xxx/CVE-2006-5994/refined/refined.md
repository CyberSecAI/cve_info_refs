    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "www.kb.cert.org_694a3a29_20250124_190838.html",
      "Match Type": "Partial"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "Microsoft Word contains a vulnerability that could be exploited when Word opens a specially crafted document. It is possible that the vulnerability can be exploited by opening a Microsoft Office document that includes an embedded Word document.",
      "Weaknesses": "Malformed string handling in Microsoft Word",
      "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word, potentially gaining complete control of the system if the user has administrative privileges.",
      "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Word document, either as a direct attachment or embedded within another document, or via a malicious website.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to craft a malicious Word document and convince a user to open it."

    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "docs.microsoft.com_025ca24e_20250124_190841.html",
      "Match Type": "Exact"
    },
    "Vulnerability": {
      "Root cause": "Microsoft Word does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file. When Word opens a specially crafted Word file and parses a malformed string, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
      "Weaknesses": "Improper data validation of strings in Word files.",
      "Impact": "Remote code execution leading to complete control of an affected system if the user is logged on with administrative rights. An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "Specifically crafted Word files sent as email attachments or hosted on malicious websites that, when opened by the user, trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create a specially crafted Word file. Attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file either as an email attachment or by visiting a malicious website."
