```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `BSX_LIBDIR` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `BSX_LIBDIR` GET parameter in the URL, an attacker can force the application to include and execute code from a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible server. They need to know the path to the vulnerable script."
