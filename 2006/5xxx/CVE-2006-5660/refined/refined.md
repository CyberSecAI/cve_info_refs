Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-5660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cisco Security Agent Management Center (CSAMC) handles authentication when configured to use an external Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** CSAMC allows a user to bypass authentication by providing a valid administrator username and a blank (zero-length) password when LDAP authentication is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker who knows a valid administrator username can gain full administrative access to CSAMC.
- **Complete Control:** The attacker obtains role privileges equivalent to those of a legitimate administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Network-Based:** The attack occurs over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Admin Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid administrator username for the affected CSAMC system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable CSAMC instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects CSAMC version 5.1 before 5.1.0.79.
- A workaround involves disabling LDAP authentication and using the local CSAMC database for administrator authentication.
- Cisco has released a software update to address this vulnerability.
