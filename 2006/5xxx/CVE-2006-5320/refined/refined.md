Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-5320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `getimg.php` script of Album Photo Sans Nom version 1.6. Specifically, the script directly uses the `$_GET['img']` parameter to read a file using `readfile()`, without sufficient validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal/Local File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. By manipulating the `img` parameter (e.g., using `..` sequences), an attacker can navigate the directory structure and access files outside of the intended web directory.
*   **Source Code Disclosure:** Because of the file inclusion vulnerability, an attacker can access and disclose sensitive files like configuration files (e.g., `config.inc.php`). This exposes sensitive information such as database credentials or other confidential settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive configuration details, potentially leading to further compromise of the application and server.
*   **Full Read Access:** An attacker could potentially read source code of the PHP scripts, internal application files, data files and other server side files, depending on file system access rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `getimg.php` with the `img` parameter modified for path traversal.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious file paths through the `img` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate URL parameters in HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided diff shows a fix implemented in version 1.7, adding a regular expression to validate the `img` parameter and prevent directory traversal (`!^(\.){2}|(/\.)!`).
*   The exploit-db entry confirms that version 1.6 of Album Photo Sans Nom is vulnerable.
*   The provided content gives more details than the original CVE description by specifying the vulnerable file, vulnerable code and the fix applied in the next version.
