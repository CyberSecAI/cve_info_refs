## Description

Despite [[1701]](/changeset/1701 "Better protection against ..."), trac appears to still be vulnerable to a fairly widespread class of Cross Site Request Forgery attacks.

These attacks require minimal action by the user: All the user needs to do is:

1. be logged into a targeted trac installation, and
2. visit a malicious remote web site (or click a malicious remote link) with the same browser

Because these attacks make use of the browsers' cached credentials, and they are launched from the browser (not from the malicious remote site), firewalls and other perimeter restrictions are not useful against them.

I've put a demonstration of this attack up [​here](http://lair.fifthhorseman.net/~dkg/testing/trac-exploit/frame.html), along with details of how trac might be modified to protect against such an attack.

Please let me know if i can be of any help fixing this.

Assuming the conditions above are met, the remote malicious site can perform any actions on the targeted trac installation that the browsing user is authorized to do. I believe this is a serious security concern.

I should add that i've tried this and tested it successfully using a fairly standard Firefox 1.5 installation, and konqueror 3.5.5, on a different trac installation. The exploit was tuned to the other installation.

I just made a couple changes to the exploit to make it function with this trac installation so that it is more apparent. If you tried it already but it failed and you want to see it in action, refresh the linked page (perhaps with your cache cleared).

sigh. even my bug reports have bugs!

Well, I've got the php source, so yes you can take it down ;)

As you said, there's nothing special to do in it… so this is indeed a bit scary.

The patch above automatically adds a form token to every method="post" form. The token generation might not be strong enough. It's probably better to use the session id instead of the username to build the token.

I've now committed trac-csrf.3.patch to trunk [r4133](/changeset/4133 "Experimental CSRF protection, see #4049.
").

The 0.10-stable version still needs more testing before we can commit anything to the stable branch.

`trac-0.10-csrf.3.patch` seems to work when applied to 0.10 for me. my original exploit fails against it. Nice work, jonas.

### [comment:15](#comment:15) by Jonas Borgström, [18 years ago](/timeline?from=2006-11-05T16%3A37%3A51%2B01%3A00&precision=second "See timeline at Nov 5, 2006, 4:37:51 PM")

I've applied trac-0.10-csrf.3.patch to the 0.10-stable branch and upgraded t.e.o to get some good testing.

we get

```
 WARNING: 500 Internal Server Error (500 Internal Server Error
 (Missing or invalid form token Do you have cookies enabled?))

```

either caused by [r4147](/changeset/4147 "The trailing '?' in XHTML processing instructions is already included ..."), or [r4145](/changeset/4145 "0.10-stable branch: Applying CSRF-patch from #4049.
").

usually we have [​http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin) enabled as well, and i thought it might be incompatible with that. trying to go back to

```
 trac.web.auth.LoginModule = enabled
 # acct_mgr.web_ui.LoginModule = enabled

```

had no effect. finally we did a roll back of the two changesets.

Ok, I've committed an updated version of the CSRF patch uses a new cookie (trac\_form\_token) to keep trac of the token. The trac\_session/auth cookie is no longer reused. I think this will solve the problem.

For those who upgraded to trac 0.10.1 to work around this bug and you are using an authz file, you probably need to apply [[4201]](/changeset/4201 "Ported [4200] to 0.10-stable (''#3996, TracBrowser hanging'')") and [[4207]](/changeset/4207 "Ported [4206] to 0.10-stable, follow-up to r4201 (''use repos.authz in ...") to your trac install to avoid [#3996](/ticket/3996 "#3996: defect: Browse Source takes forever, no debug output (closed: fixed)").

Well, using the HTMLParser has its limits… see e.g. [​http://dog4.dyndns.org:8080/trac/wiki/AxisAngleRotation](http://dog4.dyndns.org:8080/trac/wiki/AxisAngleRotation) (picked from a conversation on IRC).

There, simply *viewing* a wiki page fails because the LaTeX formula plugin probably returns some invalid HTML.

What about adding *explicitely* the `<input type="hidden" name="__FORM_TOKEN" value=<?cs var:__FORM_TOKEN ?>">` element in all the forms, instead of using the injector?

That would be a one time fix, as existing [ClearSilver](/wiki/ClearSilver) templates won't evolve anymore. Same goes for plugins, the few requiring POSTs could be easily adapted.

Actually, [0.10.1](/milestone/0.10.1 "Completed 18 years ago (Nov 8, 2006, 8:53:52 PM)") has triggered one HTML syntax [​issue](https://trac-hacks.org/intertrac/ticket%3A882 "ticket:882 in Trac-Hacks Community Site") in [​XmlRpcPlugin](https://trac-hacks.org/intertrac/wiki%3AXmlRpcPlugin "wiki:XmlRpcPlugin in Trac-Hacks Community Site"), another [​one](https://trac-hacks.org/intertrac/ticket%3A881 "ticket:881 in Trac-Hacks Community Site") in [​GraphvizPlugin](https://trac-hacks.org/intertrac/wiki%3AGraphvizPlugin "wiki:GraphvizPlugin in Trac-Hacks Community Site").

### follow-up: [27](#comment:27) [comment:26](#comment:26) by Jonas Borgström, [18 years ago](/timeline?from=2006-11-13T19%3A18%3A37%2B01%3A00&precision=second "See timeline at Nov 13, 2006, 7:18:37 PM")

As far as I know the [XmlRpcPlugin](/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin) issue was about FORM\_TOKEN validation and not HTML syntax. This should be fixed in 0.10-stable already.

The [GraphvizPlugin](/wiki/GraphvizPlugin) issue is both invalid HTML and invalid XHTML so I guess they will need to find some other way to do this. IMHO it's not important enough to block the 0.10.2 release.

| Summary: |  | | |
| Description: | Despite [1701], trac appears to still be vulnerable to a fairly widespread class of Cross Site Request Forgery attacks. These attacks require minimal action by the user: All the user needs to do is: 1. be logged into a targeted trac installation, and 1. visit a malicious remote web site (or click a malicious remote link) with the same browser Because these attacks make use of the browsers' cached credentials, and they are launched from the browser (not from the malicious remote site), firewalls and other perimeter restrictions are not useful against them. I've put a demonstration of this attack up [http://lair.fifthhorseman.net/~dkg/testing/trac-exploit/frame.html here], along with details of how trac might be modified to protect against such an attack. Please let me know if i can be of any help fixing this. You may use [WikiFormatting](/wiki/WikiFormatting) here. | | |

# Trac: Cross-site request forgery — GLSA **200612-14**

Trac allows remote attackers to execute unauthorized actions as other
users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/trac** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.1** |

### Background

Trac is a wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects.

### Description

Trac allows users to perform certain tasks via HTTP requests without
performing correct validation on those requests.

### Impact

An attacker could entice an authenticated user to browse to a specially
crafted URL, allowing the attacker to execute actions in the Trac
instance as if they were the user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Trac users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/trac-0.10.1"
```
### References
