  "cve": "CVE-2006-5815",
  "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sreplace()` function of ProFTPD. This could lead to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "ProFTPD",
    "versions": [
      "All versions up to and including 1.3.0"
    ]
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow in the `sreplace()` function due to insufficient bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ProFTPD service or cause a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading a crafted .message file",
      "Sending specially crafted commands to the server"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send commands or upload files to the server, which could be done remotely. Authentication is not required for all attack vectors, depending on the configuration.",
        "additional_details": "The exploit was demonstrated with version 1.3.0rc3 and relies on write access via FTP, however, other attack vectors may be possible on read-only servers. Mitigation techniques can be used, including removing certain directives from configuration files and using a DenyFilter directive to restrict FTP command arguments."

    "fix_information": {
    "fixes": [
      "Upgrade to ProFTPD 1.3.0a or later.",
          "Apply provided patches to affected code.",
            "Mitigation steps involving restricting configuration directives can be taken until the software can be updated."
