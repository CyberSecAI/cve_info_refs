How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : proftpd
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-5815 CVE-2006-6170 CVE-2006-6171
Debian Bug     : 399070

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the proftpd FTP
daemon, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2006-5815

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the sreplace() function
    may lead to denial of service and possibly the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2006-6170

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the mod_tls addon module
    may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-6171

    It was discovered that insufficient validation of FTP command buffer
    size limits may lead to denial of service. Due to unclear information
    this issue was already fixed in DSA-1218 as CVE-2006-5815.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problem has been fixed in version
1.2.10-15sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-16 of the proftpd-dfsg package.

We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

# ProFTPD: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200611-26**

ProFTPD is affected by mutiple vulnerabilities allowing for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/proftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.0a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.0a** |

### Background

ProFTPD is a highly-configurable FTP server.

### Description

Evgeny Legerov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
s\_replace() function in support.c, as well as a buffer overflow in in
the mod\_tls module. Additionally, an off-by-two error related to the
CommandBufferSize configuration directive was reported.

### Impact

An authenticated attacker could exploit the s\_replace() vulnerability
by uploading a crafted .message file or sending specially crafted
commands to the server, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. An
unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted data to the
server with mod\_tls enabled which could result in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running ProFTPD. Finally,
the off-by-two error related to the CommandBufferSize configuration
directive was fixed - exploitability of this error is disputed. Note
that the default configuration on Gentoo is to run ProFTPD as an
unprivileged user, and has mod\_tls disabled.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.0a"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2858#c0)  John Morrissey    2006-11-27 09:48:48 UTC  ``` ======= Summary =======  On 6 November 2006, Evgeny Legerov <admin@gleg.net> posted to BUGTRAQ[1], announcing his commercial VulnDisco Pack for Metasploit 2.7[2]. One of the included exploits, vd_proftpd.pm, takes advantage of an off-by-one string manipulation flaw in ProFTPD's sreplace() function to allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This vulnerabillity, identified as CVE-2006-5815[3], is believed to affect all versions of ProFTPD up to and including 1.3.0, but exploitability has only been demonstrated with version 1.3.0rc3. The demonstrated exploit relies on write access via FTP for exploitability, but other attack vectors may make exploitation of a read-only FTP server possible.  This vulnerability has been patched[4] in the latest release of ProFTPD, 1.3.0a, which is available from the ProFTPD web site, <http://www.proftpd.org/>. Mitigation techniques have also been developed for use until a patched version can be installed.   ======== Timeline ========  10 November - security@proftpd.org receives a message from a ProFTPD               user inquiring about a fix for the vulnerability announced               in GLEG's product. 10 November - ProFTPD core team attempts contact with admin@gleg.net. 15 November - Second contact attempt with admin@gleg.net. 16 November - Contact established, vulnerability details transferred. 20 November - Disclosure date coordinated. 27 November - Coordinated disclosure.  Given the Thanksgiving holiday, the ProFTPD core team chose to perform a coordinated disclosure the following Monday, to allow affected users and vendors ample opportunity to perform patching operations.  Unfortunately, erroneous information on the location and nature of this flaw has disseminated from unofficial sources. Some vendors have already released patches that attempt to address CVE-2006-5815 based on reports that a bug in ProFTPD's CommandBufferSize processing is its cause. To the best of the core team's knowledge, the CommandBufferSize bug in ProFTPD is not exploitable.  Vendors are welcomed and encouraged to contact security@proftpd.org to exchange information on announced vulnerabilities, and we endeavor to work to the best of our abilities with those contacting the core team. Given that we had no information about this vulnerability until several days after it was published and a CVE issued, we attempted to address it to the best of  our abilities. Constructive criticism is welcome on how to better handle  similar situations should they arise in the future.   ========== Mitigation ==========  Some users may not be able to immediately patch their ProFTPD installations. Until they are able to install a patched version, the following steps can mitigate the impact of this flaw:  - Remove DisplayConnect, DisplayLogin, DisplayChdir, DisplayFirstChdir,      DisplayFileTransfer, AccessDenyMsg, and WrapDenyMsg directives from your   ProFTPD configuration.  - Avoid using variable substitutions/magic cookies/%-style escapes in   /etc/shutmsg, when specifying a warning message with the ftpshut(8)   command, or in RewriteRule directives.  - Add a DenyFilter directive to your configuration to limit FTP command   arguments to only characters that you require. For example: 'DenyFilter   [^A-Za-z0-9_.-]' limits FTP command arguments (such as filenames) to   alphanumeric characters, the underscore, period, and dash.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c0)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-09 17:10:08 UTC  ``` <http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-5815>  Very little information available at the moment.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c1)  Matthias Saou    2006-11-09 17:40:11 UTC  ``` Indeed... please keep me posted if you manage to get more information.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c2)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-10 11:59:21 UTC  ``` Gentoo person suggested, that this might be related to this. Though I didn't give it a look... But it seema unlikely to me, because this looks like related to a configuration file parsing bug.  <http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/proftp/proftpd/src/main.c?r1=1.292&r2=1.293&sortby=date> <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152473>  I'm puzzled at all... did Evgeny report it in silence or not at all?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c3)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-10 12:25:35 UTC  ``` Aah, this is the line that is added:  cmd_buf_size = 512;  Buffer size limit was not set correctly in case CommandBufferSize had been specified in the config file. But it is present neither in any of sample config files from proftpd distribution nor in Fedora Core default one.  Thus I assume this is not related with the issue, or is it?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c4)  Matthias Saou    2006-11-13 12:26:01 UTC  ``` Strange report... one seems to have to pay in order to get access to the code that supposedly triggers the exploit and the proftpd devs seem completely silent about the issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c5)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-13 15:18:30 UTC  ``` Pointer to this was Evgeny's response to my direct question towards him. Seems, like that part of code didn't change since 2004 (<http://proftp.cvs.sourceforge.net/proftp/proftpd/contrib/mod_tls.c?view=annotate>), so might still be exploitable. <http://elegerov.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-remember-2-years-old-overflow.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c6)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-13 16:06:18 UTC  ``` The FrSIRT advisory has more info: <http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2006/4451>  "ProFTPD version 1.3.0rc5 and prior" may be incorrect though as the CVS change the advisory points to was made on Oct 31 but 1.3.0 final has been packaged for half a year already.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c7)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-13 16:08:36 UTC  ``` Oh, and the FrSIRT advisory implies that this would indeed be the same issue that Lubomir mentioned in comments 2 and 3.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c8)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-13 16:27:24 UTC  ``` Do you think, that Evgeny would sell an exploit for something, that is so unlikely (if possible at all) to exploit. I guess not. Please rethink it :)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c9)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-13 16:38:33 UTC  ``` In this case, I don't think, I report findings ;)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c10)  Matthias Saou    2006-11-13 18:12:04 UTC  ``` OK, I've queued a rebuild for devel with the patch applied. After some testing, I'll backport the patch to FC5 and FC6 branches too.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c11)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-13 18:20:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c10)) Excuse me, but how can you apply a patch and enqueue a build for devel, backport to FC5 and FC6, when we/you do not know what the issue is?     ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c12)  Matthias Saou    2006-11-13 18:24:56 UTC  ``` See the FrSIRT advisory, the section "A fix is available via CVS", which links to the change you already suggested. Since it does not say when exactly the "remote exploit" is available, it might be with non default settings, who knows (not me).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c13)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-16 09:54:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 141353](attachment.cgi?id=141353&action=diff "contrib/mod_tls.c buffer overflow patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=141353&action=edit "contrib/mod_tls.c buffer overflow patch") contrib/mod_tls.c buffer overflow patch  Hi Matthias, I have one more patch for you :) This one is from the OpenPKG project and it fixes the mod_tls issue i mentioned in  [Comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c5).   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c14)  Paul Howarth    2006-11-17 18:41:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 141513](attachment.cgi?id=141513&action=diff "Revised version of proftpd-1.3.0-cmdbufsize.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=141513&action=edit "Revised version of proftpd-1.3.0-cmdbufsize.patch") Revised version of proftpd-1.3.0-cmdbufsize.patch  The patch in CVS ([Comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c2)) appears to dereference a null pointer in the default case where the config file doesn't have a CommandBufferSize specified:  >      if (cmd_buf_size == -1) { > -	 long *buf_size = get_param_ptr(main_server->conf, > -	   "CommandBufferSize", FALSE); > +	 int *bufsz = get_param_ptr(main_server->conf, "CommandBufferSize", > +	   FALSE); >   > -	 if (buf_size == NULL || *buf_size <= 0) > -	   cmd_buf_size = 512; > +	 if (bufsz == NULL || > +	     *bufsz <= 0) { > +   pr_log_pri(PR_LOG_WARNING, "invalid CommandBufferSize size (%d) " > +	     "given, resetting to default buffer size (%u)", > +	     *bufsz, (unsigned int) PR_DEFAULT_CMD_BUFSZ); > +	   cmd_buf_size = PR_DEFAULT_CMD_BUFSZ;  In the case where bufsz is NULL, there is a reference to *bufsz when the log message is done. I found this caused a segfault immediately on connection.  Attached patch handles the cases of "buf_size == NULL" and "*buf_size <= 0" separately.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c15)  Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak    2006-11-27 16:53:56 UTC  ``` It seems the bug has already been disclosed to the public (like myself :-). Also proftpd-1.3.0a which fixes this problem is available. So far it seems that unpacking proftpd-1.3.0-6.src.rpm, and changing the Version: from 1.3.0 to 1.3.0a (and Release: to 1) is sufficient to build an updated package. Please make a new RPM as soon as possible.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c16)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-28 10:28:59 UTC  ``` Okay, just so to summarize what was discovered by Evgeny Legerov, disclosed and now fixed: There are two issues:  sreplace() stack overflow, which is the vd_proftpd.pm VulnDisco metasploit exploit -- <http://www.gleg.net/proftpd.txt>. This is fixed in 1.3.0a  mod_tls pre-auth buffer overflow. This is in VulnDisco since January 2006 and is not yet fixed in 1.3.0a.  So I disagree with Jan's [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c15), updating to 1.3.0a is _not_ sufficient. It is needed to patch for also for the mod_tls issue, because mod_tls.c module is included in Fedora package by default. An [attachment #141353](attachment.cgi?id=141353&action=diff "contrib/mod_tls.c buffer overflow patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=141353&action=edit "contrib/mod_tls.c buffer overflow patch") should fix that.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c17)  Matthew Miller    2006-11-30 15:20:00 UTC  ``` That patch appears to be in the Extras package as of Nov. 16th.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c18)  Matthias Saou    2006-11-30 15:38:35 UTC  ``` Yes, and the update to 1.3.0a has been pushed to FC-5 and FC-6 as of today, so I'll be closing this bug report, unless someone has yet another patch for yet another (possible) exploit to have included in the package ;-)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c19)  Matthew Miller    2006-11-30 15:40:21 UTC  ``` > Yes, and the update to 1.3.0a has been pushed to FC-5 and FC-6 as of today, so > I'll be closing this bug report, unless someone has yet another patch for yet > another (possible) exploit to have included in the package ;-)  I think anything new probably can get its *own* bug. :)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c20)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-30 17:41:35 UTC  ``` Just a note, FE-3 and 4 seem to still ship < 1.3.0a.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c21)  Ville Skyttä    2006-11-30 20:57:27 UTC  ``` The mod_tls issue is now [CVE-2006-6170](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6170) and cmdbufsize [CVE-2006-6171](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6171)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c22)  Matthias Saou    2007-02-02 15:31:59 UTC  ``` I have to admit that I've been mostly lost lost with all these reports... Is it OK with how things stand now? (1.3.0a for F5 & F6, 1.3.1rc for F7) Is it still possible to rebuild for F3 and F4 at all?   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=214820#c23)  Matthias Saou    2007-02-05 13:18:55 UTC  ``` [CVE-2006-5815](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-5815) is the remote code execution detailed here : <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/452760/100/200/threaded>  It was fixed in 1.3.0a, which all supported branches (FC-5, FC-6 and FC-7) have been updated too, so I'll be closing this bug. For any other vulnerabilities, please open new bug reports (the mod_ctrls buffer overflow is already [bug #219938](show_bug.cgi?id=219938 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2006-6563: proftpd < 1.3.1rc1 mod_ctrls buffer overflow")).   ``` |  |
