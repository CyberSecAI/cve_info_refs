Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-3814:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the XM loader of Cheese Tracker. Specifically, the `Loader_XM::load_instrument_internal` function is vulnerable when processing an XM file with excessive data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Buffer Overflow: The `junkbuster` buffer, which is 500 bytes in size, is overflowed when loading an XM file containing extra data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Cheese Tracker. This is achieved by crafting a malicious XM file that causes the buffer overflow, allowing the attacker to overwrite parts of the memory, potentially redirecting the execution flow to attacker-controlled shellcode.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted XM file.  An attacker would need to entice a user to load the malicious XM file into Cheese Tracker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious XM file with extra data to trigger the buffer overflow. The attacker also needs to deliver the file and convince the victim to open it using the vulnerable Cheese Tracker application.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability resides in `loaders/loader_xm.cpp` within the `Loader_XM::load_instrument_internal` function.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```c++
if (!p_xi) {
    if ((reader.get_file_pos()-p_cpos)<p_hsize) {
      Uint8 junkbuster[500];
      reader.get_byte_array((Uint8*)junkbuster,p_hsize-(reader.get_file_pos()-
      p_cpos));
    }
```
- The `junkbuster` buffer is defined with a size of 500 bytes, and the `reader.get_byte_array` function is used to read data from the input file into the buffer. When `p_hsize-(reader.get_file_pos()-p_cpos)` exceeds 500, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Affected versions:**
- Cheese Tracker versions prior to 0.9.9-r1 are vulnerable.
-  Specifically, versions <= 0.9.9 and the current CVS version at the time of discovery were affected.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.9.9-r1 of Cheese Tracker. Users were advised to upgrade to this version or later.
