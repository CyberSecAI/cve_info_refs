{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An error in the Ubuntu installer when clearing the root password from memory led to the root password being left blank instead of being locked under specific circumstances.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The installer failed to properly handle the root password when going back and continuing with the installation from the main menu, leading to a blank root password."
    ],
    "impact": "The root password could be left blank, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the system during the installation process using the alternate or server CDs, selecting 'Go Back' at the 'Installation complete' message, and then continuing the install from the main menu."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
      "Physical access to the system booting from the affected install media during the install process"
    ]
  },
  "affected_systems": [
    "Installations from the alternate or server CDs of Ubuntu 6.06 when the user selects 'Go Back' at the 'Installation complete' message and then continues with the installation from the installer's main menu.",
    "Installations from the desktop CD are not affected"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "Upgrading the `passwd` package to the newest version will detect and lock the blank root password. The next point release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS will include a corrected installer. Installations where the user selected 'Continue' when the 'Installation complete' message was first displayed are not affected."
