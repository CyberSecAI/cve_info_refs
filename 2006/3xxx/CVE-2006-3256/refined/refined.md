- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `report.php` script in WBB version 2.3.1 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `postid` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `report.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `postid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
