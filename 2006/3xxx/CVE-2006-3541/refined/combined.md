How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in [Kyberna ky2help](?product.kyberna:ky2help) ([version now known](?kb.version)). This issue affects some unknown processing of the component *Meine Links*. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a sql injection vulnerability. Using CWE to declare the problem leads to [CWE-89](?vulnerability_cwe.2351 "Cwe"). The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The summary by CVE is:
> SQL injection vulnerability in Meine Links (aka My Links) in Kyberna ky2help allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified "textboxes."

The bug was discovered 10/27/2005. The weakness was released 07/04/2006 by Marc Ruef with scip AG (Website). It is possible to read the advisory at [vuldb.com](?advisory_url.2351). The identification of this vulnerability is [CVE-2006-3541](?source_cve.2351 "Cve") since 07/12/2006. The attack may be initiated remotely. Required for exploitation is a simple authentication. The technical details are unknown and an exploit is not publicly available. The attack technique deployed by this issue is [T1505](?vulnerability_attck.2351 "Attck") according to MITRE ATT&CK.

The vulnerability was handled as a non-public zero-day exploit for at least 250 days. During that time the estimated underground price was around $0-$5k.

Upgrading eliminates this vulnerability. Applying a patch is able to eliminate this problem. The bugfix is ready for download at [kyberna.com](?countermeasure_patch_url.2351). The best possible mitigation is suggested to be upgrading to the latest version.

The vulnerability is also documented in the databases at X-Force ([27598](?source_xforce.2351 "Xforce")), SecurityFocus (BID 18800†), OSVDB (27026†) and Secunia (SA20924†).
