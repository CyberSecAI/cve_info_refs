Security Advisory
Advisory ID: SYMSA-2006-008
Advisory Title: Password Safe - Lock Password Database Configuration Not Enforced
Author: J.R. Wikes
Release Date: 07-24-2006
Application: Password Safe 2.11, 2.16, 3.0BETA1
Platform: Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)
Severity: Locally exploitable
Vendor status: Verified by vendor. Upgrade available
CVE Number: CVE-2006-3675
Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19078
Overview:
Password Safe is open source software which allows users to
create a secured and encrypted master password list. This list
is controlled and accessed through the Password Safe software
resident on a user?s workstation.
One of the security features of the software allows users to
configure the password database to lock upon the workstation
being locked or after a set period of inactivity. It was
determined that this locking feature is not enforced on either
of these events when certain dialogue windows are open in the
software.
More information on Password Safe can be obtained at
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/.
Details:
Password Safe can be configured to lock the password database
when the workstation is locked or after a set period of idle
time to prevent unauthorized access to the database contents.
When the following dialogue windows are left open in the
application the database will not lock on either of these
preconfigured events.
File > New Database
File > Open Database
File > Save As
File > Export To
File > Import From
File > Merge Database
Edit > Add Entry
Edit > Edit/View Entry
Manage > Change Safe Combination
Manage > Make Backup
Manage > Restore from Backup
Help > About Password Safe
By not locking the password database as configured, its contents
may be at risk of compromise by an attacker with access to the
workstation.
Vendor Response:
The above vulnerability was addressed for the affected
platforms in Password Safe 3.01.
Customers can download the latest version of Password
Safe from the following website:
