      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3674",
      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Armagetron Advanced versions 2.8.2 and earlier, as well as the current SVN version. \n\n A] Crash through an invalid owner value:\n   - Root cause: When a client sends an 'owner' value greater than MAXCLIENTS+1, it leads to a crash or program termination. The server terminates with an assertion failure message.\n   - Weakness: Improper input validation of the 'owner' value within the nNetObject::nNetObject function.\n   - Impact: Server crash or termination.\n   - Attack vector: Remote, by sending a crafted network message from a client to the server.\n   - Required attacker capabilities: A malicious client that can send arbitrary values to the server.\n\nB] Freeze through invalid num in id_req_handler:\n   - Root cause: By sending a large number (e.g., 0x7fff or 0xffff) in the id_req_handler function, a client can cause the server to freeze with 100% CPU usage. \n   - Weakness: Lack of proper bounds checking for the 'num' value in the id_req_handler function, located in network/nNetObject.cpp.\n   - Impact: Server freeze, resulting in denial of service.\n   - Attack vector: Remote, by sending a crafted message with a large 'num' value to the server. \n   - Required attacker capabilities: A malicious client that can send specially crafted network messages.",
