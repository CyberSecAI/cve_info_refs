  "CVE-2006-3651": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word, and could be exploited when Word opens a specially crafted mail merge file. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed e-mail message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Word parses the length of a mail merge record before it passes the message to the allocated buffer. When opening a specially crafted mail merge file, system memory may be corrupted, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who opened the file. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email attachment",
      "Malicious website hosting the file"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a specially crafted mail merge file.",
      "Ability to deliver the crafted file to a target user."
    ],
    "Affected software": [
        "Microsoft Word 2000",
        "Microsoft Word 2002",
        "Microsoft Office Word 2003",
        "Microsoft Works Suite 2004",
        "Microsoft Works Suite 2005",
        "Microsoft Works Suite 2006"
