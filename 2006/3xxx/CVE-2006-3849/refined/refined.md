{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-3849",
      "root_cause": "Insufficiently sized buffers are used in the `recvTextMessage` function of the server and the `NETrecvFile` function of the client, leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Warzone 2100 Resurrection application. This can be achieved by sending specially crafted input to the server or by enticing a user to load a specially crafted file from a malicious server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted text messages to the server via `recvTextMessage`.",
        "Enticing a user to load a specially crafted file from a malicious server via `NETrecvFile`."
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the vulnerable server or be able to host a malicious server that the client will connect to.",
      "additional_information": "The `recvTextMessage` function copies the player's name, a separator, and the message into a buffer of 256 bytes, but the maximum size of the data block can be 8000 bytes, leading to a buffer overflow. The `NETrecvFile` function copies a filename of max 255 bytes into a 128-byte buffer, causing a buffer overflow as well."
