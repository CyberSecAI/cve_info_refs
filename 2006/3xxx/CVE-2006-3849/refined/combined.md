# Warzone 2100 Resurrection: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200608-16**

Warzone 2100 Resurrection server and client are vulnerable to separate
buffer overflows, potentially allowing remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-strategy/warzone2100** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.4** |

### Background

Warzone 2100 Resurrection is a real-time strategy game, developed by
Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma discovered two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
Warzone 2100 Resurrection. The recvTextMessage function of the Warzone
2100 Resurrection server and the NETrecvFile function of the client use
insufficiently sized buffers.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted input to the server, or enticing a user to load a
specially crafted file from a malicious server. This may result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Warzone 2100 Resurrection.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround for this issue.

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Warzone 2100 Resurrection users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-strategy/warzone2100-2.0.4"
```

| [CVE-2024-50066](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "CVE-2024-50066") | [In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/mremap: fix move\_normal\_pmd/retract\_page\_tables race In mremap(), move\_page\_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.") |  |

If you visited /invoke/wm.server/connect, you'll be able to see details like internal IPs, ports, and versions.

1) Introduction
===============
Warzone 2100 is a well known commercial game developed by Pumpkin
Studios and released under the GPL license at the end of 2004.
Warzone Resurrection is the project which continues the development and
the maintaining of this game.

2) Bug
======
-------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in recvTextMessage
-------------------------------------
recvTextMessage is the function used by the server for handling the
text messages sent by the clients.
This function uses the msg buffer, which has a size of 256
(MAX\_CONSOLE\_STRING\_LENGTH) bytes, for containing the entire message to
send to all the other clients using the following format:
player\_name : message
The size of the data block can be max 8000 (MaxMsgSize) bytes so an
attacker can cause a buffer-overflow for crashing the server or
executing malicious code.
From src/multiplay.c:
BOOL recvTextMessage(NETMSG \*pMsg)
{
DPID dpid;
UDWORD i;
STRING msg[MAX\_CONSOLE\_STRING\_LENGTH];
NetGet(pMsg,0,dpid);
for(i = 0; NetPlay.players[i].dpid != dpid; i++);
//findplayer
strcpy(msg,NetPlay.players[i].name);
// name
strcat(msg," : ");
// seperator
strcat(msg, &(pMsg->body[4]));
...
---------------------------------
B] buffer-overflow in NETrecvFile
---------------------------------
The NETrecvFile function used by the clients for downloading remote
files is affected by a buffer-overflow caused by the copying of a
string of max 255 bytes in the fileName buffer of only 128 bytes.
From lib/netplay/netplay.c:
UBYTE NETrecvFile(NETMSG \*pMsg)
{
UDWORD pos, fileSize, currPos, bytesRead;
char fileName[128];
unsigned int len;
static PHYSFS\_file \*pFileHandle;
//read incoming bytes.
NetGet(pMsg,0,fileSize);
NetGet(pMsg,4,bytesRead);
NetGet(pMsg,8,currPos);
// read filename
len = (unsigned int)(pMsg->body[12]);
memcpy(fileName,&(pMsg->body[13]),len);
...

This function uses the msg buffer, which has a size of 256

The NETrecvFile function used by the clients for downloading remote
