## Microsoft Office fails to properly parse malformed chart records

#### Vulnerability Note VU#534276

Original Release Date: 2006-10-11 | Last Revised: 2006-11-17

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Microsoft Office parses files containing malformed chart records may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Office fails to properly handle malformed chart records. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-062](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-062.mspx):  *When Office opens a specially crafted file and parses a malformed chart record, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.*This vulnerability affects Microsoft Office for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected user or cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-062](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-062.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Microsoft Office documents**  Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Microsoft Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Disable automatic opening of Microsoft Office documents**By default, Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Office 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open Microsoft Office documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document.**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call a Microsoft Office application to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .ppt, .xls, and .doc) will not detect all Microsoft Office documents. Additionally, a Microsoft Office file with no file extension will also open with a Microsoft Office application. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update addresses several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

**Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers:**

| Vulnerability Identifiers | Impact of Vulnerability | Microsoft Office 2000 | Microsoft Office XP | Microsoft Office 2003 | Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac or Microsoft Office v. X for Mac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

This [assessment](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140) is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**I am updating the administrative installation points and I noticed that there are two .mspâs. Why?**

Limitations in our patch detection logic necessitate us having two separate patches. This is because the file being updated, mso.dll, ships in so many products that if we used a single .MSP to target them all, the detection logic in the MSP would be too large for our detection tools to consume. We are actively working on resolving this limitation.

**The administrative installation points lists mso.msp and pvmso.msp. Do I need to install both packages?**

Yes, the mso.msp targets most of the Office products, such as Word and Excel. The pvmso.msp targets additional Office products, such as Visio, Project and OneNote. In order to be secure you will need to install both packages.

**I do not have all of the Affected Software installed, but I do have other Microsoft Office applications installed. Why am I being offered the security update?**

This vulnerability only affects the products listed in the Affected Software section. However, other Microsoft Office applications use some of the same files as the products listed in the Affected Software that the security update affects. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft Office 2000 | Microsoft Office XP, Project 2002 Service Pack 1, or Visio 2002 Service Pack 2 | Microsoft Office 2003 | Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac or Microsoft Office v. X for Mac |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**MS06-048**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms06-048) | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced | Replaced |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Office parses a file with a malformed string.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Office parses a file with a malformed string.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Office does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file. When Office opens a specially crafted file and parses a malformed string, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
