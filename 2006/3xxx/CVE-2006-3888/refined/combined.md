## AOL YGP Pic Downloader Plugin ActiveX control buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#661524

Original Release Date: 2006-10-09 | Last Revised: 2006-10-12

---

### Overview

The AOL YGP Pic Downloader ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The AOL YGP (You've Got Pictures) Pic Downloader ActiveX control is a component that comes with AOL software. This ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control, such as the AOL browser) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed by AOL 9.0 automatic updates. Log in to the AOL service to receive the appropriate update automatically. Users with AOL older than version 9.0 are recommended to upgrade to the latest version of AOL. |
| --- |

| **Disable the AOL YGP Pic Downloader ActiveX control**The AOL YGP Pic Downloader ActiveX control can be disabled by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{D670D0B3-05AB-4115-9F87-D983EF1AC747}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser"](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer) document and the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html#ie56). |
