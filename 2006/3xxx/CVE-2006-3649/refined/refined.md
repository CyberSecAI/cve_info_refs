Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-3649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).
*   It occurs because VBA fails to properly validate document properties passed to it by a host application when opening a document.
*   Specifically, the host application can pass unchecked parameters to VBA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow, meaning data can be written beyond the allocated memory buffer, leading to potential code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The lack of proper validation of document properties by VBA is the main weakness that allows the buffer overflow to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, a successful exploit allows the attacker to take complete control of the system. This can lead to installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Less Impact on Limited User Accounts:** Users with fewer user rights on the system would be less impacted, but could still be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Documents:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by creating specially crafted documents that contain malicious document properties. These documents could be:
    *   Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.)
    *   E-mail messages (if Word is used as the HTML editor)
    *   Files opened via vulnerable applications
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host a website containing a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerability, or inject malicious content into compromised websites or web sites that accept user-provided content.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers typically rely on social engineering to trick users into opening malicious files or visiting malicious websites, through links in e-mail or instant messenger messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Files:** The attacker must be able to create specially crafted files with malicious document properties that trigger the overflow.
*   **Delivery of Malicious Files/Links:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted files or malicious links to the victim, either through email, web sites or other means.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim has to open the malicious document or visit a malicious website for the vulnerability to be exploited, in most cases, but some older software may not prompt the user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-047, which includes patches for various affected Microsoft Office applications and Visual Basic for Applications SDKs.
*   The vulnerability was privately reported but later publicly disclosed, with Microsoft acknowledging that it was being exploited in the wild.
*   Older Office versions, like Office 2000, do not prompt the user to open, save, or cancel before opening a document, potentially making it easier to exploit.
*   Microsoft recommends that users do not open files from untrusted or unexpected sources.
*   Affected products include:
    * Microsoft Office 2000 SP3
    * Microsoft Project 2000 Service Release 1
    * Microsoft Access 2000 Runtime Service Pack 3
    * Microsoft Office XP SP3
    * Microsoft Project 2002 SP1
    * Microsoft Visio 2002 SP2
    * Microsoft Works Suites 2004, 2005, 2006
    * Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications SDK 6.0, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
