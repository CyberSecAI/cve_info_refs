## Vulnerability Details

#### Visual Basic for Applications Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3649

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) checks the document properties that a host application passes to it when opening a document. This vulnerability could allow an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Visual Basic for Applications Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3649:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. A user would have to click on an attachment and then acknowledge a warning and accept a prompt to **Open** before the vulnerability could be exploited.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**Note** Office 2000 products do not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Visual Basic for Applications Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3649:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from un-trusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources.**

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

#### FAQ for Visual Basic for Applications Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3649:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) checks document properties that a host application passes to it when opening a document. This vulnerability could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results from the way that VBA checks certain document properties that a host application passes to it when opening a document. As a result, it is possible for the host application to pass unchecked parameters to VBA, causing a buffer overrun condition that could allow arbitrary code to be executed.

**What is Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)?**

Microsoft VBA is a development technology for developing client desktop packaged applications and integrating them with existing data and systems. Microsoft VBA is based on the Microsoft Visual Basic development system. Microsoft Office products include VBA and make use of VBA to perform certain functions. VBA can also be used to build customized applications based around an existing host application.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order for an attack to be successful, a user would have to open a specially crafted document sent to them by an attacker. This document could be any type of document that supports VBA, such as a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint presentation. In the case where Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor for Microsoft Outlook, this document could be an e-mail message; however, the user would need to reply to or forward the message in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Visual Basic for Applications parses the function before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. While the initial report was provided through responsible disclosure, the vulnerability was later disclosed publicly. This security bulletin addresses the publicly disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

| **/q /c:install.exe /q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts. Note that the /c and quotes are required exactly as shown. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/r:n** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt:

**VBA64-KB923167-x86-ENU.exe /q /c:install.exe /q**

**Note** Use of the **/q /c:install.exe /q** switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the **/q /c:install.exe /q** switch. Administrators should also review the KB923167.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.

To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt:

**VBA64-KB923167-x86-ENU.exe /r:n**

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125).

**Restart Requirement**
This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

To help reduce the chance that a reboot will be required, stop all affected services and close all applications that may use the affected files prior to installing the security update. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887012).

**Removal Information**
To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**File Information**
The English version of this update has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

**Verifying Update Installation**

**File Version Information**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results pane**, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name box**, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
