How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Versions: <= 3.2.2 and current CVS
versions 2.x.x and all the others in which the GT2 file
format isn't implemented are not vulnerable
Platforms: Windows, POSIX, Mac
Bug: heap overflow in GT2's loadChunk
Exploitation: local

===============
1) Introduction
===============
libmikmod is a library mainly used by Mikmod for playing different
types of audio modules (669, amf, asy, dsm, far, gdm, gt2, imf, it,
m15, med, mod, mtm, okt, s3m, stm, stx, ult, uni and xm).
#######################################################################
======
2) Bug
======
GT2 is the GRAOUMF TRACKER module file format
(http://thorkildsen.no/faqsys/docs/gt2-form.txt).
During the handling of the XCOM chunk (a field which contains an extra
comment) libmikmod reads the 32 bit number which specifies the size of
the comment and then allocates an amount of memory equal to this value
plus one, probably for an optional but unused NULL byte at the end of
the comment.
The result is that the library allocates about zero bytes of memory
("about" since MikMod\_malloc allocates 20 bytes more than the desired
size) if an attacker uses the value 0xffffffff (0xffffffff + 1 = 0) and
then tries to read the amount of memory specified by the size value
overflowing the allocated memory.
From loaders/load\_gt2.c:
GT\_CHUNK \*loadChunk(void)
...
if (!memcmp(new\_chunk, "XCOM", 4)) {
new\_chunk->xcom.chunk\_size = \_mm\_read\_M\_ULONG(modreader);
new\_chunk->xcom.comment\_len = \_mm\_read\_M\_ULONG(modreader);
new\_chunk->xcom.comment = MikMod\_malloc(new\_chunk->xcom.comment\_len + 1);
\_mm\_read\_UBYTES(new\_chunk->xcom.comment, new\_chunk->xcom.comment\_len, modreader);
return new\_chunk;
}
...
