Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way phpMyAdmin handles the "table" parameter in user requests. It's possible to craft a malicious request with a payload in the table parameter that results in XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - Lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input, specifically the "table" parameter.
  - Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users.
  - This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim
    - Theft of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Crafting a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable parameter.
  - Social engineering techniques to lure victims to click on a malicious link containing the crafted request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Remote attacker: An attacker doesn't need to be on the local network.
  - No authentication required: The attacker does not need to log in to the application to exploit the vulnerability.
  - Medium attack complexity: Crafting a malicious request and delivering it might require some knowledge about web application attack techniques.

**Affected Versions:** phpMyAdmin versions prior to 2.8.2, including 2.8.1, are vulnerable.

**Solution:** Upgrade to phpMyAdmin version 2.8.2 or higher.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by bug@securitynews.ir.
- The official phpMyAdmin security advisory is PMASA-2006-4.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2006-3388 and CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-661 (Improper Encoding or Escaping of Data)
