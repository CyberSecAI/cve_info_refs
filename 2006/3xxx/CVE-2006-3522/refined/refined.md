Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "access denied" page of MIMESweeper For Web. This page fails to properly sanitize or HTML encode user-supplied input (specifically, the URL that was blocked).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application displays the blocked URL without sanitizing it, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser.
- **Cookie Theft:** The injected JavaScript code can steal authentication cookies.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can modify the appearance of web pages or perform phishing attacks.
- **Actions on Behalf of User:** The injected code can perform actions within the user's session on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Redirection:** The attacker redirects users to a blocked URL by methods such as email or posting in organization portals.
- **URL Manipulation:** By adding a script payload to the end of the blocked URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to redirect users to a URL that is blocked by MIMESweeper.
- The attacker also needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable page is the "access denied" page shown when a user tries to access a blocked URL.
- The vulnerability arises because the application does not input validate/HTML encode the blocked URL, displaying the user-supplied input "as is".
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) URL is given as: `http://SomeBlackListedSite/<script>PAYLOAD</script>`.
- A patch has been released by Clearswift named "MIMEsweeper for Web 5.1.15 Hotfix".

The vulnerability allows for attackers to use the MIMESweeper as a central point of attack to spread malicious scripts to users. By redirecting users to a blocked URL along with a malicious script, attackers can steal cookies.
