  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'ID' argument in the `$_REQUEST` array is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query within the `engine/shards/blog.php` file, specifically in the `proc_reply` case.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection",
      "Blind SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive data, such as admin usernames and passwords, from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. This could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `index.php?shard=blog&action=proc_reply`",
       "The vulnerable SQL query is triggered by a request to this endpoint.",
        "The injected SQL is included within the 'ID' cookie"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
  },
    "exploit_details": {
    "technique": "The provided exploit uses time-based blind SQL injection. It uses the `benchmark()` function in MySQL to induce delays based on the results of the injected SQL queries. This is done to extract data one character at a time.",
    "steps": [
      "Send an HTTP GET request to `index.php?shard=blog&action=proc_reply`",
        "Include an 'ID' cookie with the SQL injection payload",
      "The exploit iterates through possible characters, triggering a delay if a character matches the data being extracted, specifically, admin username and then password",
       "The character is appended to the extracted data if a delay longer than 5 seconds is detected",
      "The process continues until a null character is found, which is used as the end of the string",
        "The extracted credentials are then printed to the user"
