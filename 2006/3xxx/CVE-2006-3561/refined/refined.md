Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the flawed logic of certain embedded devices that only perform authentication checks based on the HTTP method used in a request. Specifically, the device checks for authentication (e.g., password via Basic Authentication) only when a specific HTTP method is used (e.g., GET). This means that requests using a different HTTP method, like POST, are not subjected to the authentication check, leading to an authentication bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inconsistent Authentication Enforcement:** The primary weakness is the inconsistent application of authentication checks based on the HTTP method. The device fails to enforce authentication for requests using a different method than expected.
- **Lack of HTTP Method Validation:**  The device does not validate that a request uses an appropriate method for protected resources.
- **Reliance on HTTP method for security:** The vulnerability exists due to a security design that incorrectly depends on the HTTP method of the request to determine if authentication is needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain access to sensitive data or functionality, like downloading configuration files containing admin credentials.
- **Data Exposure:** Configuration files containing sensitive information (like admin passwords) can be downloaded without authorization, leading to compromise of the device and network.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The primary attack vector is sending HTTP requests with a different method than what is expected by the authentication mechanism (e.g. using POST instead of GET).
-   This can be achieved by a malicious actor sending a POST request directly to the device (as demonstrated in the provided example).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This means they need to be on the same network or have network access to the device.
-  No prior authentication is needed since the vulnerability allows bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided example shows how this vulnerability was present in the BT Voyager 2091 Wireless ADSL router, where attackers could download the configuration file using a POST request to `/psiBackupInfo` without authentication.

The content from secunia.com and vupen.com are not related to the specific vulnerability described in the other content and do not provide information about this CVE.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent authentication checks based on HTTP methods, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and potentially access sensitive configuration data.
