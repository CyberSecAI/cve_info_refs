{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mail2forum` phpBB Mod has multiple remote file inclusion vulnerabilities due to the insecure use of the `m2f_root_path` parameter in various PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `m2f_root_path` parameter in the URL of vulnerable PHP files, an attacker can specify a URL to a malicious file hosted on their own server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web application. They also need to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control."
