Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2006-3929:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Zyxel Prestige 660H-61 ADSL Router is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper filtering of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `rpSysAdmin` script.
- Improper input sanitization/filtering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface.
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary script execution within the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could result in various impacts such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the router's web interface
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via HTTP requests.
- Attacker crafts a malicious URL with a script embedded within the `a` parameter of the `rpSysAdmin` script, e.g., `http://router/Forms/rpSysAdmin?a=%3Cscript%3Ealert('www.eazel.es')%3C/script%3E`.
- The vulnerable page processes the attacker-supplied script without proper sanitization, causing the browser to execute it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router.
- No authentication is required.
