      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3813",
      "root_cause": "A regression in the fix for CVE-2005-0155 was introduced. The patch to correct the arbitrary file logging vulnerability in sperl (Perl setuid wrapper) was dropped in a subsequent update, reintroducing the vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of environment variables in the sperl setuid wrapper.",
        "Reintroduction of a previously fixed vulnerability due to a patch regression."
      ],
      "impact": "A local user could cause sperl to create files with arbitrary filenames (as root) or append debug information to existing files. This can lead to privilege escalation and potential system compromise.",

        "Local exploitation by setting a specific environment variable.",
        "Manipulation of the sperl process using environment variables."
