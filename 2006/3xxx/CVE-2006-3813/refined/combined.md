* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

perl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0605)

## Topic

Updated Perl packages that fix security a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and Web programming.

Kevin Finisterre discovered a flaw in sperl, the Perl setuid wrapper, which
can cause debugging information to be logged to arbitrary files. By setting
an environment variable, a local user could cause sperl to create, as root,
files with arbitrary filenames, or append the debugging information to
existing files. (CVE-2005-0155)

A fix for this issue was first included in the update RHSA-2005:103
released in February 2005. However the patch to correct this issue was
dropped from the update RHSA-2005:674 made in October 2005. This
regression has been assigned CVE-2006-3813.

Users of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0605)

## Topic

Updated Perl packages that fix security a security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Perl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system
administration utilities and Web programming.

Kevin Finisterre discovered a flaw in sperl, the Perl setuid wrapper, which
can cause debugging information to be logged to arbitrary files. By setting
an environment variable, a local user could cause sperl to create, as root,
files with arbitrary filenames, or append the debugging information to
existing files. (CVE-2005-0155)

A fix for this issue was first included in the update RHSA-2005:103
released in February 2005. However the patch to correct this issue was
dropped from the update RHSA-2005:674 made in October 2005. This
regression has been assigned CVE-2006-3813.

Users of Perl are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

perl security update (RHSA-2006-0605)

Original Release Date: August 25, 2006

Last Revised: October 20, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-163

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Perl is a popular scripting language for a multitude of tasks, including
writing system administration tools, web applications and a myriad of
"glue" programs to tie separate applications and/or data sources
together.

A flaw in how environment variables were handled was found in the setuid
wrapper for Perl (sperl). A local user could possibly cause the sperl
wrapper to create arbitrary files and/or append debug information to the end
of existing files based on setting an environment variable at runtime. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-0155](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0155) to this issue.

This issue was originally fixed in RHSA-2005:103 and updated Perl packages
were issued accordingly. However, updates to the Perl packages made by
RHSA-2006:674 did not contain the fixes applied from RHSA-2005:103, causing
the issue fixed in RHSA-2005:103 to surface again. Accordingly, a separate
CVE number has been assigned to document the reversion of the patches to
the Perl packages from RHSA-2005:103. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3813](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3813) to the issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0605.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected versions of perl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of perl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an upgrade can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
