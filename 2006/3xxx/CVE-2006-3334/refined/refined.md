      "A buffer overflow exists in the function `png_decompress_chunk()` within `pngrutil.c`. This function allocates insufficient memory space for an error message.",
       "The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient buffer allocation when creating an error message within the `png_decompress_chunk` function.",
       "This can lead to overwriting stack data."

    "impact": "By enticing a user to load a maliciously crafted PNG image, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user, or crash the application using the libpng library, such as the emul-linux-x86-baselibs.",
    "attack_vector": "By enticing a user to load a maliciously crafted PNG image.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious PNG image and entice a user to load it. The attacker needs no position as the attack vector relies on a user opening the image.",

       "The vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
       "Affected applications include those using the vulnerable libpng library, such as emul-linux-x86-baselibs.",
