# USN-575-1: Apache vulnerabilities

4 February 2008

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the Expect header from

an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message, which

could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output

during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this

to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords),

within the same domain. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2006-3918](/security/CVE-2006-3918))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server and using a

threaded MPM, Apache did not properly sanitize its input. A remote

attacker could send Apache crafted date headers and cause a denial of

service via application crash. By default, mod\_proxy is disabled in

Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-3847](/security/CVE-2007-3847))

It was discovered that mod\_autoindex did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. ([CVE-2007-4465](/security/CVE-2007-4465))

It was discovered that mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap did not force a

character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable

to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. By

default, mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-5000](/security/CVE-2007-5000))

It was discovered that mod\_status when status pages were available,

allowed for cross-site scripting attacks. By default, mod\_status is

disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-6388](/security/CVE-2007-6388))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer did not sanitize its input,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only vulnerable

in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6421](/security/CVE-2007-6421))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer could be made to

dereference a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could send a crafted

request and cause a denial of service via application crash. By

default, mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6422](/security/CVE-2007-6422))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_ftp is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-0005](/security/CVE-2008-0005))

# Security Contacts and Procedures

Red Hat takes security very seriously, and we aim to take immediate action to
address serious security-related problems that involve our products or
services.

Please report any suspected security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service to Red Hat Product Security at secalert@redhat.com. You can use our [GPG key](#contact) to communicate with us securely.

To report an issue in any Red Hat branded website or online service, please contact Red Hat Information Security at site-security@redhat.com.

## When to contact Red Hat Product Security

You should contact Red Hat Product Security if:

* You think there might be a security vulnerability in a Red Hat product or service.
* You want to provide feedback about our standards of service and performance. If you feel your security concern is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, please contact secalert@redhat.com.

In all other cases, you should contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/).

You should contact Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement if:

* You are unsure about how a known vulnerability affects a Red Hat product or service.
* You wish to report an issue in a language other than English.
* You require technical assistance for a security function (for example, "How do I configure my firewall?").
* You need help upgrading packages due to security alerts. (Refer to "How do I apply package updates from the Red Hat Network?" for information on upgrading packages.)
* Your issue is not security related.

In any of these cases, please contact [Red Hat Customer Experience & Engagement](/site/support/) instead.

## Who reads email sent to secalert@redhat.com?

Only members of Red Hat Product Security, a restricted
and carefully chosen group of Red Hat employees, will have access to
material sent to the secalert@redhat.com address. No outside users can subscribe to this list.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities in Red Hat Offerings

Red Hat Product Security welcomes and encourages all potential vulnerability submissions. For us to provide the best customer service and address issues in a timely manner, please provide the following information, if known:

* The version number of the affected component, such as the rpm package, container image, and java component.
* The environment and corresponding version(s) where the issue was discovered, for example, the operating system's name, version, architecture, or container platform.
* The steps to reproduce, if available.
* The ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability on a system.
* Is the vulnerability already known to the public? If not, when is the planned date for disclosure?
* The immediate impact if an attacker exploits the vulnerability, such as a denial of service, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

## How to contact us securely

Red Hat Product Security uses an OpenPGP key to secure our email communications. Mail sent to secalert@redhat.com can be encrypted with this public key. We expect to change the key we use from time to time. Should we change the key, the previous keys will be revoked, and the [rhsa-announce](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhsa-announce) mailing list will be notified of the change.

advisories are available from [Red Hat Product Security](/site/security/updates/) and via the [Red Hat Customer Portal](/site/security/updates/active/).

## Common Criteria Timely Updates

Refer to the [Life Cycle Security Update Policy](https://access.redhat.com/security/lifecycle-security-update-policy) for information on Red Hat's security update policy as well as information on embargoed (undisclosed) vulnerability handling.

### Resources include the following:

[Red Hat Security Updates (Advisories)](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/security-advisories)

[Red Hat CVE Database](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/cve)

[Red Hat Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) Program](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cve_program)

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)

Red Hat engages with partners, vendors, researchers, and community coordinators to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services. Multi-party coordination is a complex process, and understanding the parties' vulnerability disclosure policies, vulnerability handling policies, and contractual agreements opens the way to trusted communication and collaboration. Increasing transparency between parties assures that vendors can understand and manage the risk imposed by the vulnerability and facilitate engagements with other parties. The aim of CVD is to provide timely and consistent guidance to parties and customers to help them protect themselves.

Please see the [Red Hat CNA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://access.redhat.com/articles/red_hat_cna_vulnerability_disclosure_policy) for details on how Red Hat discloses security vulnerabilities under the Red Hat/Fedora scope.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=200738#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-31 13:45:09 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #200732](show_bug.cgi?id=200732 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-3918 httpd: Expect header XSS") +++  In May 2006 a reporter found a bug in Apache where an invalid Expect header sent to the server (Apache 1.3.3 onwards) would be returned to the user in an error message, unescaped.  This could allow a cross-site scripting attack only if a victim can tricked into connecting to a site and sending such a carefully crafted Expect header.  Whist browsers do not provide this functionality, it was recently discovered that Flash allows you to make a connection with arbitrary headers.  The attack mechanism is therefore:  1. User is tricked into visiting a malicious web site with a flash-enabled browser 2. Malicious web site uses a flash movie to make a connection to the target site with custom Expect header 3. This results in cross-site scripting (attacker could steal your cookies from the third party site, or inject content etc)  Patch: <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs?rev=394965&view=rev> [1.3]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=200738#c3)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-08 19:41:32 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0618.html>    ``` |  |

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

httpd security update (RHSA-2006-0619)

Original Release Date: September 18, 2006

Last Revised: December 6, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-194

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Apache HTTP Server is a free, open-source Web server available from the
Apache Foundation.

The Apache HTTP Server was found to contain a vulnerability when the Expect
header from an HTTP request was included in an error response. This can
create the potential for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in Web client
software that can allow for arbitrary headers in an HTTP request. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918) to this issue.

Due to an unrelated issue in the handling of malformed Expect headers by the
Apache packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 installations, the
resulting content generated by the XSS attack only will be returned after a
timeout happens (2-5 minutes) if the user doesn't cancel the request
first.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0619.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with httpd installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 1.x - 3.1.3 | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or later releases. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All version of IALX prior to IALX 2.0 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 or later releases. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All version of MSS prior to MSS 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later releases. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All version of MN prior to MN 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later releases. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of httpd, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or

The most reliable and versatile information security software on the market, reacts immediately to threats and the notification appears on the screen immediately.

– F‑Secure Total customer

It just seems to work well in the back­ground and F‑Secure have kept my computers safe for many years.

– F-Secure Internet Security Customer

Works and is reliable, just great!

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2006:0618 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2006-08-08
Updated:
2006-08-08
# RHSA-2006:0618 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

apache security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated Apache httpd packages that correct a security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server available for free.

A bug was found in Apache where an invalid Expect header sent to the server
was returned to the user in an unescaped error message. This could
allow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was
tricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect
header. (CVE-2006-3918)

While a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect header by
a third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that certain versions of
the Flash plugin can manipulate request headers. If users running such
versions can be persuaded to load a web page with a malicious Flash applet,
a cross-site scripting attack against the server may be possible.

Users of Apache should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 2 i386
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 ia64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 2 i386

## Fixes

* [BZ - 200738](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=200738)
  - CVE-2006-3918 Expect header XSS

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : apache
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-3918 CVE-2005-3352
Debian Bug     : 381381 343466

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache, the
worlds most popular webserver, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
web script.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2005-3352

   A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists in the mod_imap component of
   the Apache server.

CVE-2006-3918

   Apache does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when
   it is reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site
   scripting (XSS) style attacks.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.33-6sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.34-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

| Log Message: | ``` Thiago Zaninotti reported to security@apache.org on 20060410 a possible cross-site scripting flaw because the Expect header error message isn't escaped.  We couldn't find a way that this could be used by an attacker however, as they can't influence the Expect header a victim will send to a target site.  Thiago agreed and we're therefore not treating this as a security flaw, but it is a bug that ought to get fixed.  I'll add to  STATUS for 1.3/2.0/2.2 shortly for acks.   ``` |

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# PK24631: HTTP EXPECT HEADER VALUE CAN BE ECHOED TO BROWSER UNESCAPED

## A fix is available

[PK65782; 2.0.47.1: IBM HTTP Server V2.0.47 Cumulative Interim Fix](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/575281)

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  When IBM HTTP Server receives an unsupported Expect header field
  it will reply to the client with a 417 status code and an error
  document which includes the Expect value received from the
  client.
  When the input Expect value is included in the error document,
  it should be HTML-escaped to prevent any processing of that
  value by the web client.  The problem addressed by this APAR is
  that the Expect value is not escaped.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  In the handling of the invalid Expect header,
  an error document was sent to the client which contained the
  invalid value.  When such information from the client is
  echoed back, it must be HTML-escaped to prevent any
  processing by the browser.  However, the invalid Expect header
  was not escaped.  This is the general type of defect which can
  lead to a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.
  APAR update based on information received later:
  An exploit has been described which uses a web browser plug-in
  and the web server defect described by this APAR.  Based on this
  description and other behaviors of Apache 1.3.x, the Apache HTTP
  Server group considers the fix in Apache 1.3.x a security fix,
  with id CVE-2006-3918.  This applies to IBM HTTP Server 1.3.x
  as well.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  When building the error document and
  informing the client of the Expect value which could not be
  processed, that value is now HTML-escaped.
  Fix availability:
  6.1: 6.1.0.2 or later
  6.0: 6.0.2.13 or later
  2.0: PK25355 or later
  1.3: PK27875 or later
