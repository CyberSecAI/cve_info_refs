{
  "CVE-2006-3918": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Apache HTTP Server does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the contents of a web page or steal confidential data (such as passwords) within the same domain, if a user is tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious web site that uses a Flash movie to make a connection to the target site with a custom Expect header.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and have the user visit that site with a browser that has a vulnerable Flash plugin that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP headers."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Apache HTTP Server improperly handles the Expect header, returning it unsanitized in an error message.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (Expect header).",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of a vulnerable website, by injecting code via a crafted Expect header, leading to the theft of cookies or injection of content.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a request with a malicious Expect header and induces a user to access this request or a page returning this request, potentially using a vulnerable Flash plugin.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with arbitrary headers, such as with a vulnerable flash plugin."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "When an invalid Expect header is received, the Apache server reflects the header back in the error message without escaping it.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to a lack of output sanitization.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts via a crafted Expect header, potentially leading to information theft or arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a malicious Expect header to the Apache server, which then reflects it in the error response.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request, which may be done using a vulnerable flash plugin."
    },
      {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Expect header is reflected back in an error message without proper encoding or sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient output escaping.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker may inject and execute malicious scripts in a user's browser when they view the crafted error message.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker sends a malicious Expect header which is then reflected in an error response. An attacker may have to craft a request using a tool like a vulnerable Flash plugin to send an arbitrary Expect header.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request. The use of a vulnerable flash plugin might be necessary for crafting this request."
