wireshark security update (was ethereal) (RHSA-2006-0602)

Original Release Date: September 22, 2006

Last Revised: October 13, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-197

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Ethereal/Wireshark is a network packet sniffing and packet analyzing
utility.

The Ethereal project recently was renamed to Wireshark. Red Hat
updated
their packages in this RHSA to use Wireshark going forward on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3 and 4 and deprecate the Ethereal
packages.

Ethereal/Wireshark was found to contain several potential Denial of
Service
(DoS) vulnerabilities when reading packets live from the network.
The issues
were centered around malformed packets in general as well as the
dissectors
for ANSI MAP, NCP NMAS, NDPStelnet, Checkpoint FW-1, MQ, XML NTP.
The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-3627](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3627),
[CVE-2006-3629](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3629),
[CVE-2006-3631](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3631),
([CVE-2006-3630](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3630),
[CVE-2006-3632](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3632), and
[CVE-2006-3628](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3628) to these issues.

In order for these vulnerabilities to be taken advantage of, an
authenticated
user on the local system would have to start Ethereal (tethereal).
For Avaya
system products, only Avaya Service technicians have permissions to
run
Wireshark (tshark).

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0602.html>

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of Ethereal/Wireshark, Avaya recommends that customers
restrict
local and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced
through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and
other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update
becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected package.

# Wireshark: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200607-09**

Wireshark (formerly known as Ethereal) is vulnerable to several security
issues, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code by a remote
attacker.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/wireshark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.2** |

| Package | **net-analyzer/ethereal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.99.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, is a popular network protocol
analyzer.

### Description

Wireshark dissectors have been found vulnerable to a large number of
exploits, including off-by-one errors, buffer overflows, format string
overflows and an infinite loop.

### Impact

Running an affected version of Wireshark or Ethereal could allow for a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's computer by
sending specially crafted packets.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.2"
```

All Ethereal users should migrate to Wireshark:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --unmerge net-analyzer/ethereal
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.2"
```

To keep the [saved] configuration from Ethereal and reuse it with
Wireshark:

```
 # mv ~/.ethereal ~/.wireshark
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                CVE: [CVE-2006-3631](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3631)* The NFS dissector may have been susceptible to a buffer overflow.

                  Versions affected: 0.8.16 to 0.99.0.
                  CVE: [CVE-2006-3632](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3632)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Ethereal crash, use up available
memory, or run arbitrary code by injecting a purposefully
malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read
a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.2.

If are running Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and cannot upgrade, you can disable
each of the dissectors listed above by doing the following:

* Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.* Make sure **every** protocol listed above is un-checked.* Click "Save", then click "OK".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=199231#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-18 07:08:06 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When the developers of Ethereal switched companies they continued to work on the codebase of Ethereal, but were not able to keep the name.  Wireshark is the 'fork' that is continued to be supported for security updates. <http://www.wireshark.org/faq.html#q1.2>  This means that the Ethereal project are unlikely to provide fixes for security or other issues in Ethereal.  Ethereal has a history of needing frequent security updates, and those updates are substantial making backporting infeasible.  The proposal is to therefore replace Ethereal with Wireshark in a security update to all Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   The Wireshark project has already produced a security update which escalates this proposal.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=199231#c4)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-16 13:42:10 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0602.html>    ``` |  |

## Synopsis

wireshark security update (was ethereal)

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0602)

## Topic

New Wireshark packages that fix various security vulnerabilities in
Ethereal are now available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Ethereal is a program for monitoring network traffic.

In May 2006, Ethereal changed its name to Wireshark. This update
deprecates the Ethereal packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4
in favor of the supported Wireshark packages.

Several denial of service bugs were found in Ethereal's protocol
dissectors. It was possible for Ethereal to crash or stop responding if it
read a malformed packet off the network. (CVE-2006-3627, CVE-2006-3629,
CVE-2006-3631)

Several buffer overflow bugs were found in Ethereal's ANSI MAP, NCP NMAS,
and NDPStelnet dissectors. It was possible for Ethereal to crash or execute
arbitrary code if it read a malformed packet off the network.
(CVE-2006-3630, CVE-2006-3632)

Several format string bugs were found in Ethereal's Checkpoint FW-1, MQ,
XML, and NTP dissectors. It was possible for Ethereal to crash or execute
arbitrary code if it read a malformed packet off the network. (CVE-2006-3628)

Users of Ethereal should upgrade to these updated packages containing
Wireshark version 0.99.2, which is not vulnerable to these issues

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=199232#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-18 07:13:58 UTC  ``` From <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2006-01.html>  Name: Multiple problems in EtherealÂ® versions 0.8.14 to 0.10.10  Docid: wnpa-sec-2006-01  Date: July 17, 2006  Versions affected: 0.8.16 up to and including 0.99.0 Details Description Wireshark 0.99.2 fixes the following vulnerabilities:      * The GSM BSSMAP dissector could crash. Versions affected: 0.10.11. CVE: [CVE-2006-3627](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3627)   Ilja van Sprundel discovered the following vulnerabilities:      * The ANSI MAP dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.0. CVE: [CVE-2006-3628](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3628)     * The Checkpoint FW-1 dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.10. CVE: [CVE-2006-3628](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3628)     * The MQ dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.4. CVE: [CVE-2006-3628](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3628)     * The XML dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.13. CVE: [CVE-2006-3628](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3628)     * The MOUNT dissector could attempt to allocate large amounts of memory. Versions affected: 0.9.4. CVE: [CVE-2006-3629](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3629)     * The NCP NMAS and NDPS dissectors were susceptible to off-by-one errors. Versions affected: 0.9.7. CVE: [CVE-2006-3630](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3630)     * The NTP dissector was vulnerable to a format string overflow. Versions affected: 0.10.13.

CVE: [CVE-2006-3632](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3632)   Impact It may be possible to make Ethereal crash, use up available memory, or run arbitrary code by injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file. Resolution Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.2.  If are running Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and cannot upgrade, you can disable each of the dissectors listed above by doing the following:      * Select AnalyzeâEnabled Protocols... from the menu.     * Make sure every protocol listed above is un-checked.     * Click "Save", then click "OK".   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=199232#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-18 07:14:32 UTC  ``` Also affects RHEL3, RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=199232#c3)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-16 13:42:36 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0602.html>    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
