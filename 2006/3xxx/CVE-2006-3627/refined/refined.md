  "CVE-2006-3627": {
    "Root cause": "Malformed packets processed by the GSM BSSMAP dissector.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "The GSM BSSMAP dissector could crash when processing a malformed packet, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject specially crafted packets onto the network or provide a malformed trace file. On Avaya systems, this would require an authenticated user, likely an Avaya Service technician."
