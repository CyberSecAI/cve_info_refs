This content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Banex 2.21, including sensitive information disclosure, SQL injection, and remote file inclusion.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The file `inc/lib.inc` containing database credentials (database name, password, and user) is directly accessible without any protection.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control or proper configuration exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to database credentials, potentially leading to complete database compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `inc/lib.inc` file via HTTP request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker can access the vulnerable URL with a web browser.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improperly sanitized user input in various parts of the application allows injection of arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation or parameterization of database queries.
    *  **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or disclosure.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `admin.php` via HTTP Basic Authentication (exploitable even with magic quotes enabled)
        *   `signup.php` with crafted URL parameters.
        *   Multiple `admin.php` pages using `GET` parameters like `activatebanner`, `activateuser`, `deleteunuser`, `deleteuserbanner`, `viewmem`, `viewmemunb`, `viewunmem`, `deletebanner`, and `deleteuser`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can access the vulnerable URLs with a web browser and crafting the SQL injection payloads. Some exploits require valid admin basic auth credentials (though this too can be bypassed with SQL injection).

3.  **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application uses user-supplied input `cfg_root` to include files from remote locations.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of input validation and sanitization of the include path.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can include arbitrary remote files, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a GET request to members.php with a malicious `cfg_root` parameter
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can access the vulnerable URL with a web browser.
