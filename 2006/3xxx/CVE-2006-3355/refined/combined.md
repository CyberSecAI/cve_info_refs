How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# mpg123: Heap overflow — GLSA **200607-01**

A heap overflow in mpg123 was discovered, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/mpg123** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.59s-r11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.59s-r11** |

### Background

mpg123 is a real time audio player designed for the MPEG format.

### Description

In httpdget.c, a variable is assigned to the heap, and is supposed to
receive a smaller allocation. As this variable was not terminated
properly, strncpy() will overwrite the data assigned next in memory.

### Impact

By enticing a user to visit a malicious URL, an attacker could possibly
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running mpg123.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mpg123 users should update to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/mpg123-0.59s-r11"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-05-21 18:01:21 UTC  ``` When running mpg123 with a HTTP URL which sends _any_ HTTP redirection, mpg123 crashes:  $ mpg123 '<http://patrimonium.amberfisharts.com/download.asp?lang=de&id=20>'                                  High Performance MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 Audio Player for Layer 1, 2 and 3. Version 0.59s-r9 (2000/Oct/27). Written and copyrights by Michael Hipp. Uses code from various people. See 'README' for more! THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0808d1e8 *** Aborted  This server sends (among others) a "Location: downloads/Matthias%20Sachal%20-%20Patrimonium%20Theme.mp3" header, which leads to an overflow in a heap allocated array.  This bug is caused by a Gentoo specific mpg123 patch (103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch), written Jeremy Huddleston (eradicator@gentoo.org), and introduces a possible remote exploitability, which is why I am making this bug Gentoo Dev and Security only.  -------------------------------------------- Details: -------------------------------------------- In httpget.c:279 (after applying 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch), char *purl gets assigned some heap-allocated memory, which the patch author thought to have an upper size limit:  /* The length of purl is upper bound by 3*strlen(url) + 1 if everything in it is a space */ purl = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(url)*3 + 1));  Without the patch, this would be malloc(1024), regardless of the URL length.  In the HTTP redirection code, the redirection target is being copied into this memory area (httpget.c:483):  strncpy (purl, request+10, 1023);  Note that here the assumption is being made that the destination is (at least) 1023 bytes in size (and, additionally, the '\0' termination was not taken care of in case the redirection URL is >=1023 bytes long). The program crashes when free()ing the "request" array which comes right "above" "purl" on the heap (httpget.c:486).  (gdb) p request $4 = 0x80811e8 "Location: downloads/Matthias%20Sachal%20-%20Patrimonium%20Theme.mp3\r\n" (gdb) p purl $5 = 0x80810a0 ""  If purl got assigned a memory area sized <1023 bytes, strncpy() will overwrite the glibc heap data structure for "request" (which comes after the memory purl is pointing at on the heap) as it always pads the destination with zeroes. Additionally, an attacker MIGHT be able to send a well-crafted redirection header which overwrites this structure in a more sophisticated way, in effect enabling him to execute arbitrary code.  -------------------------------------------- Fix: -------------------------------------------- As a quick fix, * purl should be malloc'd to max(1024, strlen(url)*3 + 1), * this initial size should be recorded somewhere (similar to "request"'s "linelength") and be used in the strncpy() call instead of the hard-coded 1023. * zero termination: purl[purl_length-1] = 0  Beyond this heap overflow issue, redirection URLs with arbitrary length should be taken care of.  -------------------------------------------- Notes: -------------------------------------------- * This fix does NOT make mpg123 play the example URL above, because the redirection header is malformed (does not supply an absoluteURI as specified in the HTTP RFC) and mpg123 thinks "downloads" is the new host to connect to. * This bug might be related to [bug #78228](show_bug.cgi?id=78228 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - mpg123 crashed with *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0000000000552180 ***"). * I'm using a recent stable x86 Gentoo, in particular sys-libs/glibc-2.3.6-r3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-05-21 18:02:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 87220](attachment.cgi?id=87220 "103_all_CAN-2004-0982-NEW.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=87220&action=edit "103_all_CAN-2004-0982-NEW.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=87220&action=diff "103_all_CAN-2004-0982-NEW.patch")] 103_all_CAN-2004-0982-NEW.patch  replacement for 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-05-21 18:04:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 87221](attachment.cgi?id=87221 "separate patch on top of 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=87221&action=edit "separate patch on top of 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=87221&action=diff "separate patch on top of 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch")] separate patch on top of 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch  this is what I changed on top of 103_all_CAN-2004-0982.patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-05-21 18:19:04 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 133987](show_bug.cgi?id=133987 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - media-sound/mpg123-0.59s-r9 heap overflow") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-27 01:51:55 UTC  ``` eradicator please have a look ... ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-05-27 04:32:39 UTC  ``` An easy way to reproduce the overflow:  ( echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nLocation: "   echo -ne "[http://fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo/\r\n\r\n](http://fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo/%5Cr%5Cn%5Cr%5Cn)" )\ | nc -lp 8080 &  mpg123 <http://localhost:8080/> ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Horst Schirmeier    2006-06-06 07:04:25 UTC  ``` My report is 16 days old now; eradicator does not seem to be interested at all.

| [Description](#c0)  Stefan Boresch    2002-03-25 06:58:45 UTC  ``` The cyrus-sasl-1.5.27 ebuild fails mysteriously on some of my machines. The more "barebones" the machine, the more likely the probability of failure. I have seen this before on other machines, but when I tried again a  few days later (after upgrading some other stuff), it would compile.  Well,  since it just bit me again, and I don't find any bug report related to it, here is mine:  This is with portage 1.8.8; my USE variables are:  USE="slang readline gpm berkdb gdbm tcpd pam libwww ssl nls mitshm perl python"  The machine is pretty much up2date. NB: I don't care for cyrus-sasl, but the postfix ebuild insists on installing it (aside from the one I hacked not to use it)  Oh, and this is the error:  gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include -I/usr/local/include -Wall -W  -mcpu=i586 -march=i586 -O3 -pipe -Wp,-MD,.deps/common.pp -c common.c  -fPIC  -DPIC -o .libs/common.lo common.c: In function `_sasl_getconfpath': common.c:659: `SASL_CONF_PATH_ENV_VAR' undeclared (first use in this function) common.c:659: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once common.c:659: for each function it appears in.) common.c:661: `CONFIGDIR' undeclared (first use in this function) make[2]: *** [common.lo] Error 1 make[2]: Leaving directory  `/var/tmp/portage/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27/work/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27/lib' make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make[1]: Leaving directory  `/var/tmp/portage/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27/work/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27' make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2  !!! ERROR: The ebuild did not complete successfully. !!! Function src_compile, Line 29, Exitcode 2 !!! compile problem  !!! emerge aborting on   /usr/portage/dev-libs/cyrus-sasl/cyrus-sasl-1.5.27.ebuild .  Could it have anything to do with the fact that for (by now unknown reasons), I have glibc-2.2.4-r9 installed, but kernel-headers 2.4.17-r3. (Don't ask me how I ended up with this combination).  Nevertheless, I fail to see what this could have to do with the compile error. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-25 14:32:41 UTC  ``` does it fail mysteriously at *exactly* the same place every time? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Stefan Boresch    2002-03-25 15:40:25 UTC  ``` I don't know *exactly*, but I think so. It is reproducible *exactly* on the machine I am having the problem (and that is after rebooting several times for completely unrelated reasons --  making sure that an about to be server comes up OK after a planned/unplanned reboot; i.e., services get started in the right order etc.  So, I personally exclude Sig11 or that type of thing problems!!  Now, I can't remember exactly whether it's the same type of error I had on the previous set of machines.  It certainly feels similar; one of the first files after the ./configure step bombs, some missing "environment" variable. On these latter machines the problem somehow vanished, and so I didn't follow up on it.   The one thing I remember is that the last time the problem definitely only occurred in the gentoo(?) patched version; this I can reproduce. A tar -xzvf ; ./configure ; make by hand compiles without error (for what that is worth)  Sorry that I'm not of much help. Would an account on the "affected" machine help? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tobias Quinn    2002-03-26 07:28:31 UTC  ``` I had the same problem building this ebuild. The error messages I got were the same. I was doing:  emerge postfix fetchmail  and, looking at the comments above I found that I had both:  sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.4.16 and sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.4.17-r5 installed. I unmerged sys-kernel/linux-headers-2.4.16 and everything then built fine.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-26 16:08:35 UTC  ``` Reassigning to woodchip, since he's familiar with this problem. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-21 23:20:05 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1820](show_bug.cgi?id=1820 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - problem compiling postfix") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Donny Davies (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-23 16:50:28 UTC  ``` hi!    could you fellas please trying installing the -r1 version of this  ebuild.  i think azarah and jhudson have worked out a fix for it    please let me know how it works out, so that i can close this  bug report.    thank you.    ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Stefan Boresch    2002-04-24 08:42:31 UTC  ``` 1.5.27-r1 just built on a rather bare bones machine (similar to the one I encountered the problem with) without problems.  But to be honest, I had been assuming that the bug was fixed since 1.5.27 (not r1) built on yet  another similar machine about a week ago. So, I don't know what you fixed, but it seems to me that the original problem was less a problem of the ebuild itself rather than of other things in the system that were present (or not present)...  Stefan ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Donny Davies (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-04-24 15:48:35 UTC  ``` this is now fixed in -r1.  it was a build problem. thankfully azarah is an auto* guru ;-) ``` |  |
