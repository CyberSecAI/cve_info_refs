How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
The Quake 3 engine is the famous game engine developed by id Software
(http://www.idsoftware.com) in the far 1999 but is still one of the
most used, licensed and played engines.
It has been released open source under the GPL license some months ago
and now it's mainly maintained by Icculus
(http://www.icculus.org/quake3/) although exist many other derived
projects.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------------------------
A] files overwriting through Automatic Downloading
--------------------------------------------------
The Quake 3 engine supports an option called "Automatic Downloading"
which allows the clients to automatically download the PK3 files (maps
and mods) available on the server but not locally.
This option is disabled by default for security reasons and Icculus
Quake 3 is currently the only version of the engine which uses an anti
directory traversal check for avoiding the overwriting of system files.
Anyway this check can be bypassed through the bug B described in this
advisory, so an attacker can overwrite any file in any disk of the
computer in which Quake 3 is running.
The following is a short description of the mechanism used by the "Auto
Downloading" option for downloading a PK3 file from a server:
- server sends the list of the checksums and names of the PK3 files
currently in use: sv\_referencedPaks and sv\_referencedPakNames
these informations (cvars) are contained in the systemInfo string
- the client compares the server's filenames and checksums with its own
- every unavailable or different PK3 file is added to the neededpaks
buffer using the Q\_strcat function (for avoiding possible
buffer-overflow vulnerabilities) with the limitation of 64 chars for
each filename and the adding of the .pk3 extension to each remote and
local filename following the format: @remotename@localname
- the client starts to automatically download each file (remotename),
saves it (localname) with the temporary .tmp extension and then
renames it with the name available in the localname field seen before
The usage of Q\_strcat allows a malicious server to avoid the adding of
the .pk3 extension (needed for security reasons) to the last filename
of the neededpaks buffer if the length of 1023 bytes is reached:
@remotename.pk3@localname.pk3...@remotename.pk3@localname[.pk3]
So the latest .pk3 extension of the local filename is not added if the
total length of the string reaches this limit, that's all the bug.
The client truncates the filenames at maximum 64 bytes before adding
the .pk3 extension so we need to specify some useless files before our
target file for reaching the 1023 bytes limit.
The result is that a malicious server can overwrite all the files
contained in the folder pointed by the fs\_homepath cvar of the client
or can create new files with any possible extension.
By default fs\_homepath (where are stored the configuration files, the
Punkbuster files and others) is the ~/.q3a folder in Linux and the
Quake 3 folder in Windows BUT, as hinted before, we can modify it
through the B vulnerability which follows.
-------------------------------------------------------
B] cvars overwriting with possible information stealing
-------------------------------------------------------
The same string sent by the server containing the sv\_referencedPaks and
sv\_referencedPakNames cvars (variables) described in the previous bug
contains also many other cvars which are automatically set on the
client when the player joins the server (this is a fixed feature of the
engine, cannot be disabled and is not related to the Automatic
Downloading feature).
Everything is well explained in code/client/cl\_parse.c:
void CL\_SystemInfoChanged( void ) {
...
s = systemInfo;
while ( s ) {
Info\_NextPair( &s, key, value );
if ( !key[0] ) {
break;
}
// ehw!
if ( !Q\_stricmp( key, "fs\_game" ) ) {
gameSet = qtrue;
}
Cvar\_Set( key, value );
}
...
In short is possible to overwrite or create any cvar of the client,
those write protected too!
The malicious intents for exploiting this bug are a lot:
- enabling of the Automatic Downloading feature through
cl\_allowdownload set to 1
- overwriting any file in the system through the fs\_homepath cvar and
the bug A described in this advisory
- many others
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
The proof-of-concept consists in a small modification of the server.
The following are the two diff files for overwriting the client's file
baseq3/games.log in the c: folder, remember to create a file called
bad.txt in the server's Quake 3 folder containing the data to put in
the target client's file.
Keep in mind that this PoC is really very basic and not so optimized,
it's just a quick and simple demonstration of the effects of both the
bugs at the same time.
Enter in the Quake 3 source folder (like /tmp/quake3, the patches have
been created on the revision 810 of Icculus Quake 3) and type:

Note:
As already said the PoC is very very basic, relaunch the server or
change map if you want to re-overwrite the same file on the same client
(useless info, I tell you only in case you are not able to re-overwrite
the same file during the same server session and don't know why).
UPDATE 19 Oct 2007:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A small correction:
The cd-key stealing is not possible since the master server address is
built-in in the client code.
Sorry for this wrong info, I added it almost two weeks ago while taking
note of the possible ways for exploitating these bugs and forgot to
recheck this method.
I have updated the proof-of-concept simply adding the cl\_allowdownload
cvar, so is no longer needed to enable "Automatic Downloading" on the
client since any client with this option disabled or enabled will start
to overwrite any file in the system decided by the server of the attacker
which has full control over the client's cvars (those write protected
too, just like fs\_homepath).
As already said the PoC is very very basic, relaunch the server or
change map if you want to re-overwrite the same file on the same client
