    "description": "A buffer overflow has been discovered in the handling of .vcard files. By tricking a user into importing a malicious vcard into his contacts, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.",
    "affected_products": [
      "SeaMonkey",
      "Thunderbird",
      "Mozilla Suite"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A VCard attachment with a malformed base64 field (such as a photo) can trigger a heap buffer overwrite due to a vulnerability in the lexGetDataFromBase64 function of nsVCard.cpp. The base64 padding character ('=') is accepted anywhere in the string, and the pad count is never reset. This can make numOut negative, which is passed to memcpy() as a large unsigned size_t value.",

        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Integer underflow",
         "Improper handling of Base64 padding characters"
