# JPEG library: Denial of service — GLSA **200606-11**

The JPEG library is vulnerable to a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/jpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6b-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6b-r7** |

### Background

The JPEG library is able to load, handle and manipulate images in the
JPEG format.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Auditing Team discovered that the
vulnerable JPEG library ebuilds compile JPEG without the --maxmem
feature which is not recommended.

### Impact

By enticing a user to load a specially crafted JPEG image file an
attacker could cause a Denial of Service, due to memory exhaustion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

JPEG users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/jpeg-6b-r7"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 14:22:24 UTC  ``` we're distribute the jpeg library without a feature it calls `maxmem`, which is used to restrict images from allocating ridiculous amounts of memory and allowing developers to specify a reasonable limit for allocation.  The documentation all assumes this feature is enabled, and documents settings suc as the JPEGMEM environment variable, max_mem_to_use jpeg option, the -maxmemory argument to djpeg and so on. A user might reasonably expect these setttings to prevent a malicious image from disrupting any image processing routines that accept images from users, however they do nothing, potentially resulting in a dos via memory exhaustion.  Suggest adding --enable-maxmem option to configure, which will solve this problem. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 14:24:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 85214](attachment.cgi?id=85214 "example image") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=85214&action=edit "example image")] example image ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 14:36:19 UTC  ``` graphics herd: please provide an updated ebuild, or comment if appropriate. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 21:08:48 UTC  ``` what exactly would you say a reasonable limit is ? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 01:05:11 UTC  ``` How about we replace jpeg_mem_init() in jmemansi.c with a routine that that uses sysconf() with _SC_PHYS_PAGES?   example:  GLOBAL(long) jpeg_mem_init (j_common_ptr cinfo) {     long phys_size;      if ((phys_size = sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES)) == -1)         return DEFAULT_MAX_MEM; /* defined by libjpeg via --enable-maxmem=xx */     if ((phys_size *= sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)) < 0)         return DEFAULT_MAX_MEM;     return phys_size; }  and set DEFAULT_MAX_MEM to 64M or similar as a fallback?
