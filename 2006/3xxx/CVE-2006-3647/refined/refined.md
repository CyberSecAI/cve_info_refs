{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3647",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Word. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Word parsed a file that contains a malformed string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of malformed strings leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted Word file as an email attachment.",
      "Specially crafted Word file hosted on a malicious website."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word file and convince the user to open the file, either via email or by visiting a malicious website.  The attacker would gain the same user rights as the local user. Users with fewer user rights on the system would be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights."
