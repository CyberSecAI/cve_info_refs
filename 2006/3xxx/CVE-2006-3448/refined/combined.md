For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of EST that is being released this month, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the following FAQ, âCan I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Software | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Step-by-Step Interactive Training | Yes (with EST) | Yes |

SMS 2.0 and SMS 2003 Software Update Services (SUS) Feature Pack can use MBSA 1.2.1 for detection and therefore have the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA 1.2.1 does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT), can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about SUIT, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154/). For more information about the limitations of SUIT, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460/). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates (ITMU) can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 ITMU, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=72181). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**How do I know if I have Step-by-Step Interactive Training installed on my system?**

You can refer to the list of titles provided in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 898458](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/898458).You can also use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to determine whether âMicrosoft Press Interactive Trainingâ and âInteractive Trainingâ are included in the list of installed software. However, this is not a complete method of verification, because âMicrosoft Interactive Trainingâ does not create an Add or Remove Programs entry. âMicrosoft Interactive Trainingâ is based on the Orun32.exe file. Therefore, you must also manually determine whether the Orun32.exe file is present on your system. Customers can also manually search for all the affected files. If any one of these files is present, the system is likely to be vulnerable to this issue. The affected files are any versions of the following files earlier than the file versions that were released as part of this security update:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lrun32.exe | 3.6.0.112 | 21-Aug-2006 | 22:57 | 1,077,321 |
| Mrun32.exe | 3.4.1.102 | 26-Aug-2006 | 00:19 | 1,028,172 |
| Orun32.exe | 3.5.0.118 | 21-Aug-2006 | 22:57 | 1,077,321 |

**If I have none of the above referenced files on my system, am I vulnerable?**

No. Only the files listed in the above table are affected by this vulnerability and require an update. Customers who do not have these files on their system are not affected and will not need this update.

**Can I use SMS to determine if other programs are installed that have to be updated?**

Yes. SMS can help detect if there are other programs installed that may have installed a version of the vulnerable component. SMS can search for the existence of the file Orun32.exe. Update all versions of Orun32.exe that are earlier than version 3.5.0.118. The registry key information available in this bulletin can also be used to write specific file/registry key collection queries in SMS to detect vulnerable systems.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Interactive Training Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3448:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Step-by-Step Interactive Training because of the way that Step-by-Step Interactive Training handles bookmark link files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted bookmark link file that could potentially allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Interactive Training Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3448:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message or must click a link that is provided in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Interactive Training Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3448:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the handler for Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark link files by removing the related registry keys.**
  Delete these keys to help reduce attacks. This workaround helps reduce attacks by preventing Step-by-Step Interactive Training from automatically opening the affected file types. The content can still be opened from within the Step-by-Step Interactive Training user interface.
  **Important** This bulletin contains information about how to modify the registry. Make sure to back up the registry before you modify it. Make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 256986](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986).
  **Warning** Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedt32**, and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry:

     `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbl (for âMicrosoft Press Interactive Trainingâ)HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbm (for âInteractive Trainingâ)HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.cbo (for âMicrosoft Interactive Training â)`
  3. For each subkey that is found, click the subkey, and then click **DELETE**.
  4. In the Confirm Key Delete dialog box, click **OK**.

  These actions can also be performed at a command prompt by using the following commands in the following order:

  `reg.exe export HKCR\.cbl c:\cbl.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbl /freg.exe export HKCR\.cbm c:\cbm.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbm /freg.exe export HKCR\.cbo c:\cbo.regreg.exe delete HKCR\.cbo /f`

  **Impact of Workaround:** Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark files can no longer be opened. The content can still be opened from within the Step-by-Step Interactive Training user interface.
* **Do not open or save Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark link files (.cbo, .cbl, .cbm) that you receive from untrusted sources.**
  This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a .cbo, .cbl, or .cbm file. Do not open files that use these file name extensions. This workaround does not cover other vectors of attack such as Web browsing.
* **Remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training by using the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.**
  To manually remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training from a system, follow these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs**.
  3. In the **Add or Remove Programs** dialog box, click the name of the affected program and then click **Remove**.

  **Note** Affected versions are "Microsoft Press Interactive Training" and "Interactive Training." However, removing these programs may not be a complete workaround, because "Microsoft Interactive Training" does not create an Add or Remove Programs entry. "Microsoft Interactive Training" is based on the Orun32.exe file. Therefore, you must also manually verify that the Orun32.exe file is not present on your system.
* Follow the instructions to complete the removal.

  **Impact of Workaround:** After you remove the Step-by-Step Interactive Training application, any applications that depend on Step-by-Step Interactive Training will fail.
* **Remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training.**
  Removing Step-by-Step Interactive Training will help prevent attacks.To remove Step-by-Step Interactive Training, follow these steps:

  + Click **Start**, click **Run**, and **type**:

    %windir%\IsUninst.exe -x -y -a -f"%windir%\orun32.isu"

  **Note** You may have to replace "orun32.isu" with "mrun32.isu" or "lrun32.isu," depending on the version of Step-by-Step Interactive Training that is installed. If you have several of these versions installed, you must remove them all.

  **Impact of Workaround:** After you remove the Step-by-Step Interactive Training application, any applications that depend on Step-by-Step Interactive Training will fail.
* **Delete or rename the Step-by-Step Interactive Training .ini program file.**
  If Step-by-Step Interactive Training cannot be removed by using the methods that are documented in this section of the security bulletin, you may be able to help prevent attacks by deleting or renaming the physical file. Delete or rename the %windir%\Orun32.ini file.

  **Note** You may have to replace "Orun32.ini" with "Lrun32.iniâ or âMrun32.iniâ depending on the version of Step-by-Step Interactive Training that is installed.

  **Impact of Workaround:** After you disable the Step-by-Step Interactive Training application, any applications that depend on Step-by-Step Interactive Training may fail.

#### FAQ for Interactive Training Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3448:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

An unchecked buffer in the process that is used by Step-by-Step Interactive Training to validate bookmark link files.

**What is a bookmark link file?**

Bookmark link files are created by using the Step-by-Step Interactive Training user interface. These files allow a user the ability to quickly and easily link to a particular topic. Bookmark link files are text files that contain the information that is required by Step-by-Step Interactive Training to view a topic.

**What is Step-by-Step Interactive Training?**

Step-by-Step Interactive Training is used as the engine for hundreds of interactive training titles that are provided by Microsoft Press and other vendors. The list of known titles that contain this software is provided in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 898458](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/898458). For more information about other available Microsoft Press titles that may contain this software see the Microsoft Press Web site. This Web site will only document titles that may contain this software. Because of the nature of the distribution of this software by Microsoft, by our manufacturing partners, and by our publishing partners, there is no definitive list of all the titles that may have provided this software or of manufacturers that may have preinstalled this software. We recommend installing the available security update if you believe that this software may be installed on your system. You can also use the information provided in the "How do I know if I have Step-by-Step Interactive Training installed on my system?" frequently asked question to scan your enterprise for the affected files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker that could construct a specially crafted file and then persuade a user to visit a malicious Web site that opened this file, or an attacker that could persuade a user to open a specially crafted attachment provided in an e-mail message, could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to execute code.

There are several additional ways that an attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in each of these ways. Some examples follow:

* An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Step-by-Step Interactive Training bookmark file (a .cbo, cbl, or .cbm file) and then persuade the user to open the file.
* An attacked could send a malicious file as an attachment to a user through e-mail and then convince a user to open the attachment.
* An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also try to compromise a Web site to have it deliver a Web page that contains malicious content to try to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site or to a Web site that has been compromised by the attacker.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any operating system where Step-by-Step Interactive Training is installed is at risk from this vulnerability. Because this software is typically installed only on client systems, servers would typically not be at risk from the vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Step-by-Step Interactive Training validates the contents of a bookmark file before Step-by-Step Interactive Training copies the content into the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

(Last Updated On: June 28, 2023)

![pos system security](data:image/svg+xml...)

These assessments allow businesses to make more informed decisions and drive revenue growth. The point of sale (POS) industry is no exception.

Today’s [POS systems](https://posquote.com/best-restaurant-pos-systems/) collect huge amounts of data, including sensitive customer data. That data must be safeguarded by top data security protocols and procedures.

Consumers have concerns and need reassurance that their data is being protected.

When it comes to protecting your business, especially when data is involved, you need to take every precaution possible. This means you should have regular security assessments done by a company that specializes in cyber security. Security assessments identify vulnerabilities that criminals could exploit to attack your company’s systems and data, as well as help you develop contingency plans to deal with any attacks or disasters that may occur.

A security assessment is a detailed review of all systems and networks, including physical and virtual components within your company’s infrastructure. These assessments cover everything from data access controls and authentication protocols to software patch levels and aging hardware. They also provide a prioritized list of gaps, with a plan for how to fill those gaps. This helps your IT team create realistic budgets for future security expenses, and it also allows you to build a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness amongst employees.

The Importance of a Security Assessment also helps you meet compliance requirements for regulatory bodies, such as HIPAA for healthcare companies or PCI DSS for retail businesses. It is not enough to simply comply with these regulations, you need to show that you are working hard to prevent breaches and attacks from occurring in the first place. A security assessment provides the documentation you need to demonstrate that your business is making these efforts. This will not only protect you from fines and penalties, but it will also protect your customers’ data as well.

**They ask themselves questions like:**

* How safe *is* the personal data I give to companies I do business with?
* Can unknown third-party entities access my data?
* How easily could hackers access the data stored by vendors I purchase from?
* Are the systems those businesses use prone to viruses that could make my data vulnerable?

These are important questions that align with common concerns consumers have in today’s digital, data-driven world.

# **What Is It Important to Conduct a Security Assessment?**

**![](data:image/svg+xml...)**

This requires carrying out a data security risk assessment, complying with the latest data security protocols, and becoming certified by the highest industry standards of data protection.

But how do you perform a security assessment? Do you need a security risk assessment tool? Or a special cyber security risk assessment template? How do you even begin?

Below we’ll dig into this topic and unpack important information that any business storing customer data need to know and understand.

Then we’ll touch on benefits and other important points to keep in mind when conducting a data security risk assessment.

First, we’ll start with some basics for those starting to learn about data security, and a refresher for those already knowledgeable about the subject.

# **What Is a Security Risk Assessment?**

Also known as a cyber security risk assessment or an IT security risk assessment, it is essentially what it sounds like. It’s an audit of the systems you store data in, and the security measures you have in place to protect that data.

This audit generates a security risk assessment report that analyses your business’s data security preparedness and how secure your customer data actually is.

Common assessments evaluate how vulnerable your information technology (IT) solutions and internal operating processes are. They also provide informed recommendations for improvements in your security practices.

The end results is maximum insight into how secure your data is and which measures will reduce its vulnerability.

# **Why Are Security Risk Assessments So Important?**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/security-risk-assessment-300x246.png)Your [retail customers](https://posquote.com/retail-pos/) trust you with their data when doing business with you. They don’t need or want to be concerned about its safety.

In an age where a single cyberattack can spell financial ruin for any company, the importance of security risk assessment is more important than ever. Whether due to regulatory requirements aimed at protecting sensitive information or the desire to keep customers and business partners happy, companies of all sizes must invest time, resources and money into assessing and mitigating their risk.

To be effective, any security risk assessment must identify and understand all the assets within an organization. This means generating a map of all hardware, applications and data storage containers that might be vulnerable to attack. Once an asset map is established, it is possible to determine how a specific threat would impact each asset and the likelihood of occurrence. Then, it becomes a matter of prioritizing the most valuable assets to protect first. Trade secrets, user data and intellectual property take precedence over the cost of restoring primary business functions after an attack.

Lastly, the assessment must evaluate and score the company’s protocols in comparison to recognized standards. This is particularly true for industries like healthcare, which are required to reveal their storage and data sharing practices in order to meet government regulations such as HIPAA.

A security risk assessment can help a company remain compliant with these regulatory frameworks, as well as create transparency and trust in the minds of the company’s clients, customers and partners. It is a crucial tool for any business that must balance the need to protect its brand image and personal information with the need to keep the company’s systems running efficiently.

Proving to your customers that you are certified by the most stringent data security protocols is critical to building trust in your brand.

If prospects are not convinced that their data will be 100% secure, they are far less likely to do business with you.

Plus, if you do experience a data breach, it can have devastating impacts on your business. It can, in fact, mean the end of your business.

Unfortunately, smaller businesses suffer the most from data hacks and breaches.

**Consider these statistics:**

* 43% of data-related cyber attacks are targeted at small businesses ([Source](https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/04/cyber-attacks-target-small-business.html)).
* 60% of small businesses that experience a cyber attack find themselves out of business within six months or less ([Source](https://www.denverpost.com/2016/10/23/small-companies-cyber-attack-out-of-business/))

### **Basic Cyber Attacks**

You may already be familiar with the most basic types of cyber attacks. Here we cover the two most common types.

### **Malware Attacks**

![cyber attack pos](data:image/svg+xml...)![cyber attack pos](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cyber-attack-pos-300x169.png)Malware takes its name from the two words that describe it, taken from two different languages.

“Mal” means “bad” in Spanish. Tack on the end of the word “software” and you have “malware.”

The term malware refers to worms, viruses, spyware, and ransomware.

Malware is, in the most basic sense, bad software that installs itself or otherwise gains access to the data in an operating system. This generally happens when someone clicks an unknown, risky link in an email or downloads a dangerous attachment.

Clicking the link or opening the attachment sets in motion the installation of that “bad software” on your operating system. It takes place behind the scenes and is well masked, so you don’t notice.

Once installed, malware can:

* Obtain sensitive data from your database without your knowledge
* Prevent access from key processes and components of your operating system
* Interrupt the functioning of important components of your operating system, rendering it inoperable

### **Phishing Attacks**

![phishing attack pos](data:image/svg+xml...)![phishing attack pos](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/phishing-attack-300x243.png)“Phishing” refers to the practice of sending fake emails that, on the surface, appear to be legit communications from known entities.

Their primary goal is to manipulate recipients into disclosing sensitive personal data such as credit card and login information.

Phishing attacks also, at times, install malware on the recipient’s operating system.

### **Advanced Cyber Attacks**

More advanced cyber attacks are harder to detect and have more serious consequences when carried out successfully.

They can dig deeper into your database to uncover more secure data than basic attacks can. They use advanced masking techniques that allow the attacks to fly under the radar of many data security checkpoints, making them more dangerous and a greater risk.

This is why it’s quite important to understand the range of cyber attacks and put in place measures to catch them all, not just the basic ones.

## **The Benefits of Regular Assessments**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/security-assessment-benefits-1.jpg)The primary benefit of conducting regular security risk assessments is, obviously, to protect the sensitive data you store. However, additional benefits exist.

**Here are some key benefits:**

* Identifying potential threats before they take place
* Spotting vulnerabilities in your security systems so you can resolve them before they are exploited
* Predicting the effects that specific, potential attacks could have on your business
* Providing cyber threat recovery options
* Increasing awareness of the types of attacks that pose the largest threat at any given time
* Taking actions ahead of time to prevent potential attacks
* Improving your brand reputation and reassuring prospects and customers that their data will be safe when they do business with your company
* Increasing compliance with payment card industry (PCI) data protection standards to provide peace of mind to customers performing online payments

## **In-House Vs. Outsourced Risk Assessments**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-house-or-outsourcing-300x150.jpg)Larger businesses with in-house data protection teams and officers can more easily conduct assessments than smaller businesses with fewer resources. And those larger businesses typically start with an in-house security risk assessment.

Smaller businesses that don’t have the in-house capacity to conduct a security risk assessment often hire a third-party assessor to carry out the task. Doing so may seem more expensive than doing it in-house.

However, conducting your own security risk assessment in-house requires having a dedicated team on the payroll. So, at the end of the day, it may actually be cheaper to outsource.

Plus, many businesses that do assessments in-house can, at times, miss well-disguised threats. They then hire a third-party to do another assessment to ensure nothing was missed.

The route you take will depend on your budget and whether or not you keep an in-house security risk team on the payroll.

## **Recommended Best Practices**

To cover every recommended practice around data security would require a separate article because the scope of that topic is so broad.

But here we share some of the key practices every business should keep in mind when developing a plan for protecting the data in their [POS system](https://posquote.com/best-pos-systems/).

### **Employee Data Security Training**

![data security training](data:image/svg+xml...)![data security training](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/data-security-training-300x182.png)There are various data security training courses that businesses can implement to employees.

These courses are generally taken online and educate employees on basic and more advanced tactics they can practice themselves to protect their data.

When selecting a training course, be sure to look for one that has been certified by top data security protocols.

### **Backing Up Your Data**

These days most businesses conduct security risk assessments on cloud-based databases. This allows them to automatically back up data so that it is recoverable if it is stolen or otherwise destroyed or rendered inaccessible.

Backing up data is a must for businesses that use POS systems, and virtually every other type of business as well.

### **Strict Password Requirements**

![strict password](data:image/svg+xml...)![strict password](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/strict-passwords-300x225.jpg)

The more complicated a password is, the harder it is for hackers to identify it. That’s why it is important to implement stringent password requirements.

Common practices include requiring at least one capital letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric symbol. It is also advisable to require users to create long passwords—eight characters at minimum.

Finally, businesses should require employees to change their login password every year at least, and every six months if possible. Plus, you should restrict the use of old passwords that employees have used in the past.

### **Limit User Privileges**

POS systems give businesses the ability to determine the level of data access that each user has.

Some users may only be able to access certain functions but be restricted from others. That is necessary. If *everyone* had access to do *everything* in your system, chaos could ensue.

### **Set Up a Firewall**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/firewall-300x225.jpg)This may seem obvious but at a very basic level, it is necessary to have standard virus protection and a firewall around your data to prevent breaches.

Any decent POS system should allow you to install virus protection software and a firewall if the system doesn’t already come with those things out of the box.

### **Conduct Assessments Often**

Data security experts recommend that you conduct a security risk assessment once a month, or at least once per quarter.

Data management changes stemming from new projects have the capacity to render previously secure data processes insecure.

New threats pop up all the time so having a strict cadence around your security risk assessment is crucially important.

### **Additional Layers of Protection**

Think of data protection measures like layers of an onion. The data is at the center but to get to it you must peel off various layers, each one being a little harder to peel.

Similarly, data protection should include multiple layers to minimize vulnerability. Below are a few additional layers of protection you can put in place to ensure your data is safer.

### **Renewing Employee Certification**

Once an employee successfully completes a data security training course and becomes certified, they should retake the course every year. This helps employees to stay up to date on emerging threats and risks, and understand how to deal with them.

### **Physical Security Components**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lock-system-300x199.jpg)A physical security risk assessment should be part of your overall assessment process.

It’s advisable to install a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system with cameras so you can check out what happened if a data breach occurs on site.

You should also include other basic physical security layers like coded locking systems to keep your business safe during closed hours.

If your data is highly sensitive, you can also employ guards, install fences, and leverage other practical security measures.

### **Data Encryption**

Data encryption is a big one. The data passing from an employee into the POS system should be encrypted. And the data that passes from the system into the data server should also be encrypted.

### **User Roles**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/user-roles-pos-300x211.png)As mentioned above, it’s important to restrict the access each employee has to your data. You can do this by giving each user a “user role.”

These can range from an “admin” user who has access to everything, to a “standard user” who can only see limited data.

Let’s use an example of a hypothetical situation a business could encounter during a risk assessment. A new employee starts her first day, and she is given access to all the data in the system.

Now she can see payroll information about her boss, revenue numbers, and other information that is above her paygrade.

Implementing user roles lets you limit access per employee based upon which data they *need* to access.

# **Wrapping It Up**

Data security risk assessments are vital to the safety of your data. New strategies of attack are conceived in the minds of hackers every day.

It is important to stay ahead of those who would steal your and your customers’ data. By following the tips above you can ensure you have the right measures and processes in place to prevent attacks before they happen.

Plus, the advice outlined above will help you quickly resolve any data attacks that ever do happen.

The businesses that embrace data security risk assessments and put in place a strict data protection regime will be the ones that succeed today and in the future.

Those businesses that don’t take data security seriously and do not conduct data security risk assessments will be those who get hacked, lose customers, and ultimately fade from existence.

## Microsoft Step-by-Step Interactive Training contains a buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#466873

Original Release Date: 2007-02-14 | Last Revised: 2007-02-23

---

### Overview

Microsoft Step-by-Step Interactive Training contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Step-by-Step Interactive Training is a training program developed by MIcrosoft. It is preinstalled by some computer manufactuers and is included in many Microsoft Press books. Microsoft Knowledge Base article [898458](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/898458) contains a partial list of software and publications that include the Step-by-Step Interactive training.  The Step-by-Step Interactive Training contains a buffer overflow. To trigger the vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted bookmark link file. The bookmark file name extension can be .CBL, .CBM, or .CBO. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted bookmark link file, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who is running the Step-by-Step Interactive Training program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-005](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms07-005.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Do not run Windows with administrator privileges**Running Windows using an unprivileged regular user account may mitigate the affects of this vulnerability. See the Microsoft Technet article [Applying the Principle of Least Privilege to User Accounts on Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/luawinxp.mspx) for more information. |

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.
