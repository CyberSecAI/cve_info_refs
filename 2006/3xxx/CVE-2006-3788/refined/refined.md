{
  "CVE-2006-3788": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the network components of UFO2000 that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the network handling of the UFO2000 game.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `recv_add_unit` function, where data is copied to a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.",
     "Improper handling of user-supplied data within the `decode_stringmap` function can lead to reading unallocated memory and server crashes.",
     "Array manipulation issues in multiple command handlers, allowing out-of-bounds access, potentially leading to code execution",
      "An SQL injection vulnerability in `server_protocol.cpp`, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
     "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `recv_map_data` function, overflowing a global buffer."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the remote client or server. Furthermore, an attacker could run arbitrary SQL queries against the server's account database, and perform a denial of service by crashing the game.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted network traffic during a multiplayer game.",
      "Specially crafted packets sent to the server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send crafted network packets either as a player on a game server or directly to the server."
