How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# UFO2000: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200702-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the network components of
UFO2000 that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-strategy/ufo2000** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.7.1062** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7.1062** |

### Background

UFO2000 is a multi-player, turn-based tactical simulation.

### Description

Five vulnerabilities were found: a buffer overflow in recv\_add\_unit();
a problem with improperly trusting user-supplied string information in
decode\_stringmap(); several issues with array manipulation via various
commands during play; an SQL injection in server\_protocol.cpp; and
finally, a second buffer overflow in recv\_map\_data().

### Impact

An attacker could send crafted network traffic as part of a
multi-player game that could result in remote code execution on the
remote opponent or the server. A remote attacker could also run
arbitrary SQL queries against the server account database, and perform
a Denial of Service on a remote opponent by causing the game to crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

UFO2000 currently depends on the dumb-0.9.2 library, which has been
removed from portage due to security problems (GLSA 200608-14) .
Because of this, UFO2000 has been masked, and we recommend unmerging
the package until the next beta release can remove the dependency on
dumb.

```
 # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge ufo2000
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
UFO2000 is a multiplayer turn based game based on the X-COM series.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
-----------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in recv\_add\_unit
-----------------------------------
The command used for adding units (just the first command used at the
beginning of the challenge) is affected by a buffer-overflow
vulnerability which happens during the copying of the incoming data to
the name buffer of only 26 bytes.
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_add\_unit()
{
int num;
char name[26];
int cost;
pkt >> num;
pkt >> name;
...
--------------------------------------------
B] invalid memory access in decode\_stringmap
--------------------------------------------
When a packet is received the server calls decode\_stringmap which is
used for reading the number of informations (keys and values) contained
in the incoming data block and for their subsequent reading.
Here exist two problems:
- invalid size values can lead to the reading of the unallocated memory
after the packet and to the subsequent crash of the server (for
example keysize says to read 100 bytes while the packet is only 2
bytes long)
- the server terminates if keysize or valsize are too big and cannot be
allocated with the resize function
From server\_transport.cpp:
bool decode\_stringmap(std::map &info, const void \*buffer)
{
const unsigned char \*p = (const unsigned char \*)buffer;
unsigned int num = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
while (num--) {
unsigned int keysize = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
unsigned int valsize = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
std::string key;
key.resize(keysize);
std::string val;
val.resize(valsize);
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < keysize; i++)
key[i] = decode\_unsigned\_char(p);
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < valsize; i++)
val[i] = decode\_unsigned\_char(p);
info[key] = val;
}
return true;
}
-----------------------------------------
C] possible code execution through arrays
-----------------------------------------
Some commands can be used for crashing the remote client/opponent
through invalid values (too big or negative) used for moving into the
internal arrays of the game.
Another effect is the possibility to execute malicious code, in fact
the game uses large numbers (usually signed 32 bit values) which can be
used to reach any location of the memory, then these commands allow
the writing of the data contained in the packet into these locations
like what happens with "pkt >> scenario->rules[index]" where our 32 bit
number (pkt >>) is copied in the location chosed by us with index.
These commands are recv\_rules, recv\_select\_unit (select\_unit checks
only if num if major not minor), recv\_options and recv\_unit\_data (with
a negative value or minor than 19).
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_rules()
{
int index;
pkt >> index;
pkt >> scenario->rules[index];
...
----------------
D] SQL injection
----------------
The server uses an internal SQL database for handling accounts and
other informations about the matches.
In the points where is used the user's input and the %s format argument
instead of %q could be possible to inject own SQL commands in the query
prepared by the server.
From server\_protocol.cpp:
bool ServerClientUfo::recv\_packet(NLuint id, const std::string &raw\_packet)
...
case SRV\_GAME\_REPLAY\_REQUEST: {
send\_packet\_back(SRV\_GAME\_RECOVERY\_START, "1");
try {
debug\_game\_id = atol(packet.c\_str());
sqlite3::reader reader=db\_conn.executereader("select command, packet\_type, id from ufo2000\_game\_packets where game=%s order by id;", packet.c\_str());
...
---------------------------------
E] mapdata global buffer overflow
---------------------------------
mapdata is a global buffer declared in main.cpp as a GEODATA structure
of 56 bytes which can be overflowed through the recv\_map\_data function.
The effect is the immediate crash of the opponent.
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_map\_data()
{
std::string map\_name;
std::string map\_data;
pkt >> map\_name;
pkt >> mapdata.x\_size;
pkt >> mapdata.y\_size;
pkt >> mapdata.z\_size;
pkt >> map\_data;
ASSERT((int)map\_data.size() == mapdata.x\_size \* mapdata.y\_size);
memcpy(&mapdata.mapdata, map\_data.data(), map\_data.size());
....
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
No proof-of-concept available.
The following is a quick introduction about how server and client work
for understanding the possible exploitation of these bugs.
The server simply acts as a place where clients can meet themselves and
can start 1vs1 challenges.
The server could also disallow anonyomous logins, using just accounts
which require a valid username and password.
In each challenge the work of the server is only that of forwarding the
packets from and to the clients, so they are in a virtual direct
communication and their vulnerabilities can be exploited by both
malicious clients and servers.
The packets exchanged in the lobby are handled by the server (SRV\_\*)
while those during the challenge by the clients (CMD\_\*).
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
Some of the most critical bugs have been fixed in SVN 1058 while the
remaining in revision 1061.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
UFO2000 is a multiplayer turn based game based on the X-COM series.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
-----------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in recv\_add\_unit
-----------------------------------
The command used for adding units (just the first command used at the
beginning of the challenge) is affected by a buffer-overflow
vulnerability which happens during the copying of the incoming data to
the name buffer of only 26 bytes.
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_add\_unit()
{
int num;
char name[26];
int cost;
pkt >> num;
pkt >> name;
...
--------------------------------------------
B] invalid memory access in decode\_stringmap
--------------------------------------------
When a packet is received the server calls decode\_stringmap which is
used for reading the number of informations (keys and values) contained
in the incoming data block and for their subsequent reading.
Here exist two problems:
- invalid size values can lead to the reading of the unallocated memory
after the packet and to the subsequent crash of the server (for
example keysize says to read 100 bytes while the packet is only 2
bytes long)
- the server terminates if keysize or valsize are too big and cannot be
allocated with the resize function
From server\_transport.cpp:
bool decode\_stringmap(std::map<std::string, std::string> &info, const void \*buffer)
{
const unsigned char \*p = (const unsigned char \*)buffer;
unsigned int num = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
while (num--) {
unsigned int keysize = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
unsigned int valsize = decode\_unsigned\_int(p);
std::string key;
key.resize(keysize);
std::string val;
val.resize(valsize);
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < keysize; i++)
key[i] = decode\_unsigned\_char(p);
for (unsigned int i = 0; i < valsize; i++)
val[i] = decode\_unsigned\_char(p);
info[key] = val;
}
return true;
}
-----------------------------------------
C] possible code execution through arrays
-----------------------------------------
Some commands can be used for crashing the remote client/opponent
through invalid values (too big or negative) used for moving into the
internal arrays of the game.
Another effect is the possibility to execute malicious code, in fact
the game uses large numbers (usually signed 32 bit values) which can be
used to reach any location of the memory, then these commands allow
the writing of the data contained in the packet into these locations
like what happens with "pkt >> scenario->rules[index]" where our 32 bit
number (pkt >>) is copied in the location chosed by us with index.
These commands are recv\_rules, recv\_select\_unit (select\_unit checks
only if num if major not minor), recv\_options and recv\_unit\_data (with
a negative value or minor than 19).
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_rules()
{
int index;
pkt >> index;
pkt >> scenario->rules[index];
...
----------------
D] SQL injection
----------------
The server uses an internal SQL database for handling accounts and
other informations about the matches.
In the points where is used the user's input and the %s format argument
instead of %q could be possible to inject own SQL commands in the query
prepared by the server.
From server\_protocol.cpp:
bool ServerClientUfo::recv\_packet(NLuint id, const std::string &raw\_packet)
...
case SRV\_GAME\_REPLAY\_REQUEST: {
send\_packet\_back(SRV\_GAME\_RECOVERY\_START, "1");
try {
debug\_game\_id = atol(packet.c\_str());
sqlite3::reader reader=db\_conn.executereader("select command, packet\_type, id from ufo2000\_game\_packets where game=%s order by id;", packet.c\_str());
...
---------------------------------
E] mapdata global buffer overflow
---------------------------------
mapdata is a global buffer declared in main.cpp as a GEODATA structure
of 56 bytes which can be overflowed through the recv\_map\_data function.
The effect is the immediate crash of the opponent.
From multiplay.cpp:
int Net::recv\_map\_data()
{
std::string map\_name;
std::string map\_data;
pkt >> map\_name;
pkt >> mapdata.x\_size;
pkt >> mapdata.y\_size;
pkt >> mapdata.z\_size;
pkt >> map\_data;
ASSERT((int)map\_data.size() == mapdata.x\_size \* mapdata.y\_size);
memcpy(&mapdata.mapdata, map\_data.data(), map\_data.size());
....
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
No proof-of-concept available.
The following is a quick introduction about how server and client work
for understanding the possible exploitation of these bugs.
The server simply acts as a place where clients can meet themselves and
can start 1vs1 challenges.
The server could also disallow anonyomous logins, using just accounts
which require a valid username and password.
In each challenge the work of the server is only that of forwarding the
packets from and to the clients, so they are in a virtual direct
communication and their vulnerabilities can be exploited by both
malicious clients and servers.
The packets exchanged in the lobby are handled by the server (SRV\_\*)
while those during the challenge by the clients (CMD\_\*).
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
Some of the most critical bugs have been fixed in SVN 1058 while the
remaining in revision 1061.
