I don't know anyone report this but I have detected this when test EzUpload Pro 2.2.0
Attacker can re-config EzUpload system without login.
File: filter.php --> change Extensions Mode file type.
File: access.php --> change Protection Method accept anyone upload file
File: edituser.php --> Add user who can upload
File: settings.php --> Change admin informations
File: index.php --> Upload file without login even system require login
Check it and fun
