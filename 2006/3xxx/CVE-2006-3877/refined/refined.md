  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when PowerPoint opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file which will result in the access of memory outside intended regions when parsing placeholder data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of malformed records.",
      "Insufficient data validation when processing file content."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user. If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights. Vulnerability may cause PowerPoint to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted PowerPoint file included in an e-mail attachment.",
      "Specially crafted PowerPoint file hosted on a malicious web site.",
       "Compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker would have to persuade the user to open the malicious file via email or visit a malicious webpage hosting it."
