### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### PowerPoint Malformed Record Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3877:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PowerPoint and could be exploited when PowerPoint opened a specially crafted file. Such a file might be included in an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Malformed Record Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3877:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update addresses several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**I am updating the administrative installation points and I noticed that there are two .mspâs. Why?**

Limitations in our patch detection logic necessitate us having two separate patches. This is because the file being updated, mso.dll, ships in so many products that if we used a single .MSP to target them all, the detection logic in the MSP would be too large for our detection tools to consume. We are actively working on resolving this limitation.

**The administrative installation points lists mso.msp and pvmso.msp. Do I need to install both packages?**

Yes, the mso.msp targets most of the Office products, such as Word and Excel. The pvmso.msp targets additional Office products, such as Visio, Project and OneNote. In order to be secure you will need to install both packages.

**I do not have all of the Affected Software installed, but I do have other Microsoft Office applications installed. Why am I being offered the security update?**

This vulnerability only affects the products listed in the Affected Software section. However, other Microsoft Office applications use some of the same files as the products listed in the Affected Software that the security update affects. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Office parses a file with a malformed string.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Office Improper Memory Access Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3434:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Office parses a file with a malformed string.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Office does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file. When Office opens a specially crafted file and parses a malformed string, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

## Microsoft PowerPoint malformed record memory corruption

#### Vulnerability Note VU#205948

Original Release Date: 2006-10-10 | Last Revised: 2007-02-26

---

### Overview

Microsoft PowerPoint contains a vulnerability in the handling of malformed records, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft PowerPoint contains a vulnerability that could be exploited when PowerPoint opens a specially crafted document. The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of malformed records, which can cause memory corruption. This vulnerability affects both Windows and Mac versions of PowerPoint. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted PowerPoint document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running PowerPoint. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system. This vulnerability may also cause PowerPoint to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-015.mspx). Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-058](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-058.mspx) attempted to address the problem but the fix was not sufficient. |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted PowerPoint documents**Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected PowerPoint or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).**Disable automatic opening of PowerPoint documents**By default, PowerPoint 97 and PowerPoint 2000 will configure Internet Explorer to automatically open PowerPoint documents. This feature can be disabled by using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8B5762D2-077F-4031-9EE6-C9538E9F2A2F&displaylang=en). Mozilla Firefox users should disable automatic opening of files, as specified in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#ffdownloadactions) document.**Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call PowerPoint to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if presentation.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open presentation.qwer with PowerPoint. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .ppt, .pot, and .pps) will not detect all PowerPoint documents. Additionally, a PowerPoint file with no file extension will also open with the PowerPoint application. |

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update addresses several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of PowerPoint, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### PowerPoint Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3435:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PowerPoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when PowerPoint parsed a file that included a malformed object pointer.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3435:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.

#### Workarounds for PowerPoint Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3435:

* Do not open or save Microsoft PowerPoint files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### PowerPoint Malformed Record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4694:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PowerPoint and could be exploited when PowerPoint opened a specially crafted file. Such a file might be included in an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Malformed Record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4694:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.
