How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Filter Actions

* Article
* 11/17/2009
## In this article

Applies To: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2

A filter action defines the security requirements for the data transmission. Filter actions can be defined when you create a policy or before you create a policy. Filter lists are available to any policy. To define a filter list, right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage filter lists and filter actions**.

A filter action can be configured to:

## Permit traffic

IPsec passes this traffic to and from the TCP/IP driver without modification or the requirement for security. This is appropriate for traffic from computers that are not IPsec-capable. Be sure to limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope when using this type of filter action, so that you do not permit traffic that should be secured.

Consider allowing ICMP traffic for troubleshooting purposes. You might also need to allow a computer that is not in your domain (for example, a consultant's computer) access to another computer in your domain. You can use the permit filter action to allow this access.

Important

The permit filter action allows access without authentication, data integrity, or encryption. Anyone using a computer with the IP address specified in the filter list is given the access. All traffic between the computers is done in plaintext; no integrity checks are performed.

## Block traffic

IPsec silently discards blocked traffic. When using a blocking filter action, be sure to use an IP filter list that defines the correct scope of IP addresses. Using larger scopes increases the chance of blocking traffic between valid computers.

## Negotiate security

If you enable the **Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec** option, IPsec attempts to negotiate security associations (SAs) and the sending or receiving of IPsec-protected traffic. However, if the peer cannot use IPsec, the communication will be allowed without IPsec protection. After you choose this filter action, you can also configure the following:

* Security methods and their order. This list of methods defines in which order the methods will be attempted. The first successful method will be used and the remaining methods will not be attempted. Typically, the list should be ordered from highest security to lowest security, so that the most secure method is used.
* Acceptance of initial incoming unsecured traffic (**Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec**). IPsec allows an incoming packet that matches the configured filter list to be unsecured (that is, not protected by IPsec). However, the outgoing response to the incoming packet must be protected. This setting is useful when you are using the default response rule for clients. When a group of servers are configured with a rule that secures communications with any IP address and accepts unsecured communication, responding with only secured communications, enabling the default response rule on client computers ensures that the clients will respond to the server request to negotiate security. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Enabling of communication with non-IPsec-enabled computers (**Allow unsecured communication if a secure connection cannot be established**). IPsec falls back to unsecured communication, if necessary. Again, you should limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope. Otherwise, if negotiation fails for any reason, any communications affected by the rule in which this filter action resides could result in data being sent without security. If you are concerned about unsecured communication, you might consider disabling these settings. However, communication with computers that cannot initiate IPsec, such as legacy systems, might be blocked. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Generation of quick mode session keys from new main mode keying material (**Session key perfect forward secrecy (PFS)**). Enabling session key PFS ensures that main mode master keying material cannot be used to derive more than one quick mode session key. When quick mode PFS is enabled, a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed to generate new main mode master keying material before the new quick mode key is created. Session key (quick mode) PFS does not require main mode reauthentication and uses fewer resources than master key (main mode) PFS.

## IPsec security methods

Each security method defines the security requirements of any communications to which the associated rule applies. Creating multiple security methods increases the chance that a common method can be found between two computers. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component reads the list of security methods in descending order and sends a list of allowed security methods to the other peer. The first method in common is selected. Typically, the most secure methods appear at the top of the list; the least secure methods appear at the bottom of the list.

### Predefined security methods

The following security methods are predefined:

#### Encryption and Integrity

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data confidentiality (encryption) with the triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm, data integrity and authentication with the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) integrity algorithm, and default key lifetimes (100 megabytes (MB), 1 hour). If you require both data and addressing (IP header) protection, you can create a custom security method. If you do not require encryption, use Integrity only.

#### Integrity only

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data integrity and authentication with the SHA1 integrity algorithm and default key lifetimes (100 MB, 1 hour). In this configuration, ESP does not provide data confidentiality (encryption).

#### Custom security methods

If the predefined Encryption and Integrity or Integrity only settings do not meet your security requirements, you can specify custom security methods. For example, you can use custom methods when encryption and address integrity, stronger algorithms, or key lifetimes must be specified. When configuring a custom security method, you can configure the following:

##### Security protocols

Both AH (data and address integrity without encryption) and ESP (data integrity and encryption) can be enabled in a custom security method when you require IP header integrity and data encryption. If you chose to enable both, you do not need to specify an integrity algorithm for ESP.

Note

The AH protocol cannot be used over network address translation (NAT) devices because it uses a hash of the header. NAT devices alter the header, so the packet will not authenticate properly.

##### Integrity algorithm

Message Digest 5 (MD5), which uses a 128-bit key. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should be used only when interoperability requires its use.

SHA1, which uses a 160-bit key. SHA1 is a stronger hash than MD5 and is compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

##### Encryption algorithm

3DES is the most secure of the DES combinations and somewhat slower in performance. 3DES processes each block three times, using three unique 56-bit keys.

DES uses a single 56-bit key and is used when the higher security and overhead of 3DES is not required. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should only be used when interoperability requires it.

Session key (quick mode) settings determine when, not how, a new key is generated. You can specify a lifetime in kilobytes (KB), seconds, or both. For example, if the communication takes 10,000 seconds and you specify the key lifetime as 1000 seconds, 10 keys will be generated to complete the transfer. This ensures that, even if an attacker manages to determine one session key and decipher part of a communication, the attacker cannot decipher the entire communication. By default, new quick mode keys are generated for every 100 MB of data or every hour. Any time a key lifetime is reached, the SA, in addition to the key refresh or regeneration, is also renegotiated.

**To create a filter action using the New Rule Properties dialog box**

1. On the **Rules** tab of the **IP Security Policy Properties** dialog, clear the **Use Add Wizard** check box if you want to create the filter action in the property dialog box. If you want to use the wizard, leave the check box selected. Click **Add**. The following instructions are for creating a filter list using the dialog box.
2. On the **Filter Action** tab of the **Rule Properties** dialog box, clear the **Use Add Wizard** checkbox and click **Add**.
3. On the **Security Methods** tab, select the method (action) that the rule will use.
4. (Optional) On the **Description** tab, type a description of the filter action. This description can help you sort through filter actions and allows you to quickly identify the filter action without having to open its properties.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Repeat steps 4 through 8 to add additional filter actions to the list.

Note

Although the rule can list several filter actions, only one filter action can be used per rule.

7. On the **Filter Action** tab, select the appropriate filter action for the rule and click **OK**.

**To create a filter action using the Manage filter lists and filter actions dialog box**

1. Right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage IP filter lists and filter actions**.
2. On the **Manage Filter Actions** tab, clear the **Use Add Wizard** check box if you want to create the filter action using the property dialog box. If you want to use the wizard, leave the check box selected. Click **Add**. The following instructions are for creating a filter list using the dialog box. The directions below do not use the wizard.
3. On the **Security Methods** tab, select the method and click **OK**.
4. If you selected the Negotiate security option, you can add multiple methods and specify the order they will be attempted. To do this click **Add**.
5. (Optional) On the **Description** tab, type a description of the filter. This description can help you sort through filters and allows you to quickly identify the filter without having to open its properties.
6. Click **OK**.
7. Repeat steps 4 through 8 to add filter actions to the list.

## Microsoft Windows Server service buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#650769

Original Release Date: 2006-08-08 | Last Revised: 2006-09-18

---

### Overview

A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the Microsoft Server service. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

| **Microsoft Server Service**  [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-040.mspx) includes the following information:*The Server service provides RPC support, file print support and named pipe sharing over the network. The Server service allows the sharing of your local resources (such as disks and printers) so that other users on the network can access them. It also allows named pipe communication between applications running on other computers and your computer, which is used for RPC.* **Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MS RPC) and Server Message Block (SMB)**RPC provides a mechanism that allows a program to execute a procedure on a remote system in a way that is transparent to the calling program. MS RPC is the Microsoft implementation of RPC. Windows services that use MS RPC may use SMB named pipes as the transport service for MS RPC calls. **The Problem**A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the Microsoft Server service. If a remote attacker sends a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable Windows system, that attacker may be able to trigger the buffer overflow.Note that we have received reports that this vulnerability is actively being exploited.More information, including a list of affected versions of Windows, is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-040.mspx). We have confirmed that this vulnerability affects Windows NT4. However, according to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-040.mspx):*Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 have reached the end of their support life cycles. It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from Microsoft**  Microsoft addresses this vulnerability with the updates listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-040.mspx).Microsoft has released a new version of Security Bulletin [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-040.mspx) and the associated security updates. The new version corrects the problem described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [921883](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921883). Programs that request large amounts of contiguous memory running on Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition systems with the previous version of the MS06-040 update installed could crash. |
| --- |

| Until a patch can be applied, the following actions may reduce the chances of exploitation:  **Block or Restrict Access**Block access to SMB services (139/tcp, 445/tcp) from untrusted networks such as the Internet.**Restrict anonymous access**Restrict anonymous SMB access. See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [246261](http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q246/2/61.asp) for information about configuring anonymous access in Windows 2000. Note this will not prevent authenticated users from exploiting this vulnerability, and may have adverse affects in mixed-mode domains. Anonymous SMB access to SAM accounts is restricted in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 by default.Other workarounds are available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-040](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-040.mspx). |

**What is the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Product | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Buffer Overrun in Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3439:

There is a remote code execution vulnerability in Server Service that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Buffer Overrun in Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3439:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Buffer Overrun in Server Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3439:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall:**

  This port is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below.
  Applications that uses SMB (CIFS)
  Applications that uses mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  Server (File and Print Sharing)
  Group Policy
  Net Logon
  Distributed File System (DFS)
  Terminal Server Licensing
  Print Spooler
  Computer Browser
  Remote Procedure Call Locator
  Fax Service
  Indexing Service
  Performance Logs and Alerts
  Systems Management Server
  License Logging Service
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this feature is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB921883\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
