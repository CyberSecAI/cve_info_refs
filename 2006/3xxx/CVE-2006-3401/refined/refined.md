            "root_cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `CS_ITEMS` config string.",

                "Remote network attack",
                 "Sending a specially crafted `CS_ITEMS` config string to the Quake 3 server"

            "required_capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to a vulnerable Quake 3 server. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the server, just the ability to connect and send the malicious config string.",
             "details": "The exploit involves injecting a DLL into the server process. The DLL hooks the `SV_SetConfigstring` function. When the `CS_ITEM` config string is set, the hook function will overwrite the stack by filling a buffer, injecting a new EIP. The engine strips bytes >127, '%', and '\\0' before the overflow."
