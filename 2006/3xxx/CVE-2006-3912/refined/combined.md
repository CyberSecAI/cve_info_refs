WinRAR - Stack Overflows in SelF - eXtracting Archives
======================================================

Tested Version(s)..: WinRAR 3.60 beta 4
Author.............: posidron

An SFX (SelF-eXtracting) archive is an archive, merged with an executable
module, which is used to extract files from the archive when executed. Thus no
external program is necessary to extract the contents of an SFX archive, it is
enough to execute it. Nevertheless WinRAR can work with SFX archives as with
any other archives, so if you do not want to run a received SFX archive (for
example, because of possible viruses), you may use WinRAR to view or extract
its contents. SFX archives usually have .exe extension as any other executable
file. (Quote: WinRAR Help)

WinRAR distributive includes several SFX modules. All SFX modules have .sfx
extension and must be in the same folder as WinRAR. By default WinRAR always
uses Default.sfx module.

Following commands are supported SFX commands by WinRAR, to configure the
executable module and to provide additional informations. These commands
will be placed in the "Comments" section within the produced package.

    License=<title of the license dialog>{license text}
    Delete=<filename>
    Overwrite=[n]
    Path=<path>
    Presetup=<program /arguments>
    Savepath
    Setup=<program>
    Shortcut=<DestType>,<SrcName>,<DestFolder>, <Description>,<ShortcutName>
    Silent=[Param]
    TempMode=[question,title]
    Text={string}
    Title=<title>

A detailed explanation of each command can be obtained in the "WinRAR Help",
in chapter SFX.

Each command above, which take string sequences as arguments is vulnerable
to a plain stack overflow while passing the user controled buffer through a
wsprintfA() without bounds checking.

This command allows to add a comment to an archive. The maximum comment
length is 62000 bytes for RAR archives and 32768 bytes for ZIP archives.
(Quote: WinRAR Help)

I selected the "Path" command to do a proof of concept of this vulnerability.
(2039 fill bytes + 4 bytes to overwrite the instruction pointer)

Example:

   004039B6  push  0                                ; /lParam = NULL
=> 004039B8  push  sample.00401183                  ; |DlgProc = sample.00401183
   004039BD  lea   edx, dword ptr ss:[ebp-24]       ; |
   004039C0  push  0                                ; |hOwner = NULL
   004039C2  mov   dword ptr ds:[415D78], edx       ; |
   004039C8  lea   ecx, dword ptr ss:[ebp-3C]       ; |
   004039CB  push  sample.00414113                  ; |pTemplate = "STARTDLG"
   004039D0  push  ebx                              ; |hInst
   004039D1  mov   dword ptr ds:[415D7C], ecx       ; |
   004039D7  call  <jmp.&USER32.DialogBoxParamA>    ; \DialogBoxParamA
........
=> 00401183  push  ebp
   00401184  mov   ebp, esp
   <snip>
   004015D0  push  eax                              ; /Path
   004015D1  call  <jmp.&KERNEL32.SetCurrentDirecto>; \SetCurrentDirectoryA
   004015D6  test  eax, eax
   004015D8  jnz   short sample.00401641
   004015DA  mov   eax, 82
   004015DF  call  sample.004029B4
   004015E4  push  eax                              ; /<%s>
   004015E5  lea   edx, dword ptr ss:[ebp-2C14]     ; |
   004015EB  push  edx                              ; |<%s>
   004015EC  push  sample.00414132                  ; |Format = "\"%s\"\n%s"
   004015F1  lea   ecx, dword ptr ss:[ebp-2E14]     ; |
   004015F7  push  ecx                              ; |s
:) 004015F8  call  <jmp.&USER32.wsprintfA>          ; \wsprintfA
   <snip>

After overflowing the "path" command:

   EAX 00000000
   ECX 766EF7A0
   EDX 3F55EB94 ntdll.KiFastSystemCallRet
   EBX 41414141
   ESP 766EFFDC ASCII "BBBBBBBBBBBB"
   EBP 00000003
   ESI 7673DB1E ASCII "SavePath\r\n"
   EDI 00414064 sample.00414064
   EIP DEADBEEF

The user has to open the SFX archive directly, so that nomally the GUI installer
would popup, to trigger the vulnerability. Not by choosing the "Extract to.."
option of WinRAR in the "right click" context menu.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

RAR compression algorithm can use multiple Windows processor groups       to utilize up to maximum supported 64 logical processors.       It can improve RAR compression speed on systems with logical       processors number exceeding 64 and not multiple of 64.        Previously the maximum number of logical processors was limited       to a single processor group size, such as 36 for 72 processors.     2. Tree panel uses the logical sorting for folders inside of archives.       It treats digits in folder names by their numerical value, so folders       are sorted as "1", "2", "10" instead of "1", "10", "2".       Such sorting was already used for folders outside of archives.     3. Dark mode visual improvements.        4. Bugs fixed:        a) if new files have been added to existing semi-solid RAR archive          created with -se or -s switches, such files could be damaged.          This issue doesn't affect usual solid archives created with -s,          also as non-solid archives;              b) if internal viewer "Autodetect encoding" option was on, a wrong          encoding name could be displayed in the viewer status bar;        c) compressing a network share top level folder from Explorer          context menu failed with "Cannot open" error.         Version 7.10 beta 2     1. Numerous dark mode improvements and fixes.     2. "Dark mode" options in "Settings/Interface" are renamed to "Color mode".     3. It takes less time for WinRAR items in Windows 11 context menu to       appear, when right clicking a lot of selected archives.     4. Exporting settings with "Export settings to file" command        of "Options/Import and export" submenu doesn't trigger       User Account Control prompts anymore.     5. "Bad archive" exit code 13 is returned in the command line mode,       when attempting to unpack a non-RAR archive with .rar file extension.     6. "External viewer name" field in "Settings/Viewer" recognizes "\", "..\"       or ".\" in the beginning of path, allowing to specify paths relative       to WinRAR program folder. Paths like \utils\viewer.exe, ..\viewer.exe       or .\viewer.exe can be helpful for WinRAR installation on USB drive       without a fixed drive letter        7. Bugs fixed:           a) compression speed could be lower than expected for rare specific          combination of source data in a non-solid archive;        b) console RAR fell into infinite loop, when trying to process user          input in prompts like the overwrite prompt in Windows 7;        c) running executables from archive subfolders failed with          "Cannot execute" error;        d) WinRAR.ini contents could be reset if "Reuse existing window" option          was on and multiple archives were opened in the same WinRAR window.         Version 7.10 beta 1     1. "Settings/General" dialog page is split to "Settings/Interface"       and "Settings/System" pages. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs       instead of horizontal.        2. WinRAR sets the dark interface mode if "Color mode" option       in "Settings/Interface" is set to "Dark". This option can enable       dark and light modes unconditionally or use Windows color mode settings.     3. "Large memory pages" option in "Settings/System" dialog and -mlp       command line switch enable using 2 MB memory pages instead of       default 4 KB, when allocating large memory areas in RAR archive       format compression and extraction routines.        It allows to improve archiving and, in some cases, extraction speed.       Typically the performance gain is more significant for bigger       compression dictionaries and slower compression methods.        This feature requires "Lock pages in memory" privilege       and if it is missing, WinRAR proposes to assign it to the current       user account, making it available for other software too.       Windows restart is necessary to activate the newly assigned privilege.        4. "Zone value only" option in "Settings/Security" dialog controls       if archive Mark of the Web propagation includes only the security zone       value or all available fields.        While additional fields, such as a download location or IP address,       might help to identify a file source, they can be a privacy concern       if file is shared with other persons.     5. Switch -om[-|1][=list] controls Mark of the Web propagation       in WinRAR and console RAR command line mode.     6. Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows are not supported anymore.       WinRAR requires Windows 7 x64 or later.        Unlike WinRAR, 32-bit self-extracting modules are still provided       as a part of 64-bit installation package.     7. "Auto", "Always on" and "Disable" choices are now available       for "Delta compression" and "Executable compression" options       in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog.              To improve the compression speed, "Auto" applies these options       depending on the compression method, such as disabling them       for "Fastest" and "Fast" methods. Use "Always on" to enable them       for all methods.     8. Name of environment variable to store the default set of RAR switches       is changed from "RAR" to "RARINISWITCHES". It is rather typical       for batch scripts to use "RAR" environment variable name to store       RAR executable pathname, which led to the name conflict previously.     9. "Completion message title" and "Completion message text" options       on "Text" page of "Advanced SFX options" dialog allow to define       a custom message displayed on the successful completion of SFX archive       extraction.        This message can also be added with "TextDone" script command.        SFX logo and icon options are moved to the new "Logo and icon" page       of "Advanced SFX options" dialog. Dialog navigation uses vertical tabs       instead of horizontal.       10. Windows 11 context menu:        a) compression profiles in the new context menu are placed above          extraction commands, similarly to the legacy context menu;        b) separator lines are inserted between archive open, extraction          and archiving command groups.    11. When extracting a file with NTFS "Compressed" attribute,       this attribute is assigned in the beginning of file extraction.       Typically it reduces the extraction time compared to assigning it       after writing the file data.    12. When adding files to existing RAR archive, folders previously stored       in such archive are moved to a position after newly added files.       So folder timestamps are set after extracting all files and are not       modified when creating files inside of these folders.    13. Temporary file isn't created anymore for "rar ch -tl" command       if no archive modification switches like -rr or -z have been specified.       Modification time of newest archived file is set directly to original       archive file, without copying the archive data. It reduces disk write       and processing time.       14. If archive is truncated at recovery record or quick open information       service blocks, the additional message with truncated block type       is displayed after the standard "Unexpected end of archive".       15. RAR compression algorithm can use multiple Windows processor groups       to utilize up to maximum supported 64 logical processors.       It can improve RAR compression speed on systems with logical       processors number exceeding 64 and not multiple of 64.        Previously the maximum number of logical processors was limited       to a single processor group size, such as 36 for 72 processors.    16. Bugs fixed:        a) if new files have been added to existing semi-solid RAR archive          created with -se or -s switches, such files could be damaged.          This issue doesn't affect usual solid archives created with -s,          also as non-solid archives;        b) even though the long range search isn't used with -m1 "fastest"          compression method, switches -m1 -mcl+ or -m1 -mcl with 256MB          or larger compression dictionary still allocated memory required          for long range search algorithm;        c) if "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option was on          when extracting a file from archive subfolder, clicking on ".."          in the file list afterwards displayed the folder with the archive          file instead of parent folder inside of archive;        d) if application was started from archive and created multiple files          with monotonically growing date, WinRAR could issue archive update          prompts for every created file instead of a single prompt.         Version 7.01     1. Bugs fixed:        a) updating an encrypted file in a solid RAR archive produced          a corrupt archive if updated file was the first in archive,          no password was specified when starting updating and file name          encryption in the updated archive wasn't enabled;        b) WinRAR 7.00 crashed after switching to "Flat folders view" mode          from archive subfolder;        c) switch -ep4 duplicated the specified path instead of excluding it          when extracting;        d) if archive created by Unix RAR version contained symlinks with          path separator characters in target paths, these characters could be          broken when modifying such archive with Windows RAR;        e) invalid file name was displayed in file rename and file execute          WinRAR error messages;        f) SFX "Shortcut" command failed to recognize empty parameters          defined like "Shortcut=D,"",folder", while correctly recognizing          such parameters without quote marks like "Shortcut=D,,folder";        g) volume reconstruction didn't work in WinRAR.exe if "rc" command          was specified with .rev file, such as "WinRAR rc arc.part1.rev".          Unlike RAR, WinRAR required to use only .rar file name here.      Version 7.00     1. Compression dictionary sizes larger than 1 GB are supported       for RAR archive format. Depending on the amount of physically       available memory, dictionary up to 64 GB can be selected.        Not power of 2 dictionary sizes can be specified for dictionaries       exceeding 4 GB. So we are not limited to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 series       and can use values like 5 GB or 22 GB.        Archives with dictionaries exceeding 4 GB can be unpacked only       by WinRAR 7.0 or newer. 64-bit WinRAR version is needed to unpack       archives with dictionaries exceeding 1 GB.        Increasing the dictionary size can improve the compression ratio       for large files with distant repeated blocks, like virtual machine       disk images. It also can be efficient for sets of large similar files       in a solid archive, such as a collection of software ISO images       differing by version or localization.     2. WinRAR issues a prompt allowing to cancel or continue if dictionary       size in extracted RAR archive exceeds "Maximum dictionary size       allowed to extract" parameter in "Settings/Compression".       It is done to prevent the unexpected excessive memory allocation.        In the command line mode by default WinRAR refuses to unpack archives       with dictionary exceeding 4 GB. Use -md or -mdx to allow       unpacking dictionaries up to and including the specified size.       Unlike -md, -mdx is applied to extraction only and can be       added to RAR environment variable, not affecting archiving commands.     3. "Define dictionary sizes" dialog in "Settings/Compression" can be used       to customize dictionary sizes proposed in the drop down list associated       with "Dictionary size" field in "Archive name and parameters" dialog.     4. Alternate search algorithm, optimized to locate longer and more distant       repeated data blocks, can be used when creating RAR archives.       It helps to improve the compression ratio and sometimes speed       for redundant data like big text files.              It increases memory usage and might reduce the compression speed       for some types of data. It can be turned on or off with       "Long range search" options in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog       or with -mcl[+|-] switch. If "Auto" option is selected, WinRAR applies       the long range search depending on the compression method, dictionary       size and other parameters.        This algorithm is required for dictionaries exceeding 4 GB       and turning it off is ignored for such dictionaries.     5. Much slower and more exhaustive repeated data search and compression       algorithm can be enabled with "Exhaustive search" option       in "Advanced compression parameters" dialog or with -mcx switch.       It might provide the additional compression gain for some types of       redundant data, but at much lower compression speed.        Long range search is needed to implement this mode efficiently,       so the exhaustive search option activates it automatically.        Both long range and exhaustive search option do not affect       the compatibility of created archives. So if dictionary size       is in 128 KB - 4 GB range, archives created with these search options       can be unpacked by all WinRAR versions beginning from 5.0.              6. Maximum path length limit is increased from 2047 to 65535 characters.     7. Creating archives in RAR 4.x format isn't supported anymore.       Options and switches specific for this format are removed.       It doesn't affect RAR 4.x archives decompression, which is included       into WinRAR.     8. "Propagate Mark of the Web" option in "Settings/Security" dialog       controls assigning the archive Mark of the Web to extracted files.       It is possible to prohibit propagating, allow it for several       predefined file groups, for all files or for files matching user       defined file masks.        Mark of the Web is the security zone information added by Internet       browsers to downloaded files. It can be used by various software       for security purposes.        It is supported only by GUI WinRAR. Console RAR doesn't propagate       Mark of the Web regardless of this option.     9. "Attributes" column can be enabled in "Settings/File list/Columns".       It displays file attribute abbreviations, such as 'A' for "Archive"       and 'D' for directory.        If file attribute isn't among those recognized by WinRAR,       the numeric value of file attributes is also displayed.       This value uses hexadecimal format for Windows attributes       or octal format for Unix attributes.       10. "Benchmark" command allows to specify the exact number of threads       and copy results to clipboard. Information about WinRAR and Windows       versions, CPU and memory is added to benchmark window.       11. "Remove redundant folders from extraction path" option       in "Settings/Paths" is now applicable also to extraction commands       invoked from WinRAR user interface and to multiple archives       unpacked to separate folders. It removes a destination path       component, only if its name matches both the archive name and root       archived folder name, provided that there are no other folders       or files in archive root.        For example, it will remove one of "Pictures" in the destination path       if we unpack Pictures.rar containing the root "Pictures" folder       to "Pictures\" destination.        Previously it worked only for a single archive extracted from       context menu and didn't check if archived folder name matches       the last destination path component.    12. "Word wrap in comment" option in "Interface" options group       in "Settings/General" toggles the word wrap mode in archive comment       window.       13. Dictionary size data in archive information dialog is now available       for .bz2, .lz, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz, .tar.lz, .tar.zst archives.    14. Switch -ol- prohibits archiving and extracting symbolic links.       15. Switches -sl[u] and -sm[u] recognize [k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T]       size units for kilobytes, thousands of bytes, megabytes, millions       of bytes, gigabytes, billions of bytes, terabytes, trillions of bytes.       If unit character is 'b', 'B' or not present, bytes are assumed.        Previously these switches accepted bytes only.    16. SFX TempMode command accepts the optional @set:user parameter       allowing to modify temporary folder permissions, so only the current       user can access it. It prohibits a local user to replace files       in a temporary folder if SFX is started under another account.        It also can be enabled with "Restrict folder access" option       in "Advanced SFX options/Modes" dialog.        Some installers might fail to start in a folder created with       @set:user parameter.       17. File permissions and NTFS alternate streams are not saved for       hard link entries. They are saved only for the source file these       entries refer to. It allows to reduce the archive size, because       such file properties are automatically propagated to hard links       copies when extracting.    18. Keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl+A to select all files or Alt+E to       unpack found archives, are now functional in "Search results" window       also while search is still in progress. Previously they were available       only after completing search.       19. Switch -v[unit] recognizes 't' and 'T' as terabytes and       trillions of bytes for volume size units.       20. Warning is issued if leading '-' character is missing in a parameter       specified in "Additional switches" field of WinRAR archiving        and extraction dialogs. Also it is issued for parameters lacking '-'       in RAR environment variable and rar.ini file.        Previously such malformed parameters were ignored silently.    21. "Convert archives" command displays the smooth total operation progress.       Previously the total progress was updated abruptly after converting       an archive and was visible only when processing multiple archives.    22. Proper progress is displayed when compressing symbolic link targets.    23. "Integrate WinRAR into shell" option in WinRAR "Settings/Integration"       is grayed out if "Global\Integration=0" is present in winrar.ini file.    24. 64-bit WinRAR version uses 64-bit SFX modules by default.       64-bit SFX modules are needed to unpack archives with dictionaries       exceeding 1 GB.           32-bit modules are renamed to Default32.SFX, Zip32.SFX, WinCon32.SFX.    25. Maximum allowed dictionary size for archiving and extraction       can be specified in gigabytes in MaxDictA and MaxDictE variables       in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Policy" Registry key.       If these variables are smaller than corresponding values defined       in WinRAR interface, they override interface values.    26. Console RAR filters out character 27 from screen output. It is done       for security reasons, because this character can be used to declare       ANSI escape control sequences in some terminal applications.        We are thankful to Siddharth Dushantha for bringing this issue       to our attention.    27. Bugs fixed:        a) it was possible to overwrite Mark of the Web, propagated from          archive to extracted files, and modify its security zone information          utilizing a specially crafted .rar archive.           We are thankful to Orange Tsai and NiNi from DEVCORE Research Team          working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative for letting us know          about this security issue.           Unlike WinRAR, unrar.dll library doesn't propagate the archive          Mark of the Web and leaves it to a caller application to assign it          to extracted files. So unrar.dll isn't affected by this issue;        b) "User defined archive extensions" field in "Settings/Integration"          was not saved if winrar.ini was used to store settings          and WinRAR was started under non-administrator user account.         Version 6.24     1. Bugs fixed:        a) WinRAR and UnRAR.dll extraction command dereferenced a null pointer          and crashed when processing a zero length archive name          in the archive metadata stored with -am switch.           We are thankful to Radoslaw Madej from Check Point software          for reporting this issue;           b) WinRAR and UnRAR.dll extraction command overwrote extracted file          data with contents of ::$DATA NTFS alternate data stream,          if such stream was present in the archive. In this case          unpacked data size and checksum could mismatch file size          and checksum displayed in WinRAR file list. It didn't affect          file name and type, which were displayed properly.           We are thankful to Ata Hakcil for reporting this issue.         Version 6.23     1. Added extraction of XZ archives utilizing ARM64 filter.        2. Rar$LS* temporary files, created when extracting or testing multiple       archives from Windows context menu, are now deleted immediately.       Previously they were deleted only on next WinRAR runs and only       if they were at least 1 hour old.        3. Bugs fixed:        a) a security issue involving out of bounds write is fixed          in RAR4 recovery volumes processing code.           We are thankful to goodbyeselene working with Trend Micro Zero Day          Initiative for letting us know about this bug;        b) WinRAR could start a wrong file after a user double clicked          an item in a specially crafted archive.           We are thankful to Andrey Polovinkin from Group-IB Threat          Intelligence unit for letting us know about this bug;        c) if both NTFS and Unix time extra fields were available for a file          in ZIP archive, extraction command ignored the second extra field          even if it provided more time fields than first one;        d) interface themes were applied to archive icons even if          "Apply to archive icons" option in "Organize themes" dialog          was turned off.         Version 6.22     1. Bugs fixed:        a) extracting individual files from solid archives created by          RAR versions older than 2.0, could fail in WinRAR 6.20 and 6.21.          It didn't affect extracting the entire archive, which was performed          correctly;        b) files in Unix ARJ archives could be erroneously displayed as folders          in WinRAR file list;        c) "Display files in Explorer" extraction option was ignored          if "When done: Close WinRAR" option was also set and archive          was opened in WinRAR before extracting;        d) file size value in the internal viewer status bar didn't include          the byte order mask field, displaying a smaller than actual size          for Unicode files.         Version 6.21     1. Both file and folder modification timestamps are restored       when unpacking TAR and TAR based archives like tar.gz and tar.bz2.       Previously only file modification timestamps were set       for these archive formats.        2. Added decompression of .tar.zst archives with dictionary       exceeding 128 MB. WinRAR 6.20 allowed such dictionary for .zst,       but not for .tar.zst.     3. Switches -ed and -e+d are also supported by ZIP archives.       Previously they worked only for RAR archives.     4. Bugs fixed:        a) if unencrypted file was stored after encrypted in the same          RAR archive and both files had been unpacked in the same extraction          command, WinRAR 6.20 failed to unpack the unencrypted file;        b) in some cases a wrong detailed reason of file open error could be          displayed in the second line of open error message.         Version 6.20     1. If "Autodetect passwords" option in "Organizer passwords" dialog       is enabled and password matching a processing archive is present       among saved passwords, it is applied automatically. This option       is applicable only for archives in RAR 5.0 and ZIP formats,       which allow to verify the password validity quickly.        There is a minor chance of incorrect password detection       for ZIP archives if stored passwords do not include a proper one.       If encrypted ZIP archive extraction fails, you can try to disable       this option, repeat extraction and enter a valid password manually.     2. If extraction command involves only a part of files in RAR archive,       the additional archive analysis is performed when starting extraction.       It helps to properly unpack file references even if reference source       is not selected. It works for most of RAR archives except for volumes       on multiple removable media and archives containing a very large       number of references.        Also in some cases such analysis may help to optimize the amount       of processing data when extracting individual files from       semi-solid archives created with -s and -se switches.     3. "Save original archive name and time" option on "Options" page       of archiving dialog allows to save the original archive name       and creation time. If archive includes such saved name and time,       they are displayed on "Info" page of "Show information" command       and can be restored on "Options" page of same command.       Restoring involves renaming an archive to original name and setting       the saved time as the archive creation and modification time.        Switch -ams or just -am together with archive modification commands       can be used to save the archive name and time in the command line mode.       These saved parameters are displayed in header of "l" and "v" commands       output and can be restored with -amr switch combined with "ch" command,       such as "rar ch -amr arc.rar". If -amr is specified, "ch" ignores       other archive modification switches.     4. Faster RAR5 compression of poorly compressible data on modern CPUs       with 8 or more execution threads. This applies to all methods       except "Fastest", which performance remains the same.     5. "Repair" command efficiency is improved for shuffled data blocks       in recovery record protected RAR5 archives.              6. If file size has grown after archiving when creating non-solid       RAR volumes, such file is stored without compression regardless of       volume number, provided that file isn't split between volumes.       Previously it worked only for files in the first volume.     7. Added decompression of .zipx archives containing file references,       provided that both reference source and target are selected       and reference source precedes the target inside of archive.        Typically, if .zipx archive includes file references, it is necessary       to unpack the entire archive to extract references successfully.        8. Added decompression of .zst long range mode archives with dictionary       exceeding 128 MB. Previously it was possible to decompress them only       if dictionary was 128 MB or less.     9. If "Turn PC off", "Hibernate", "Sleep" or "Restart PC" archiving       options are enabled in WinRAR, a prompt to confirm or cancel       such power management action is displayed directly before starting it.       If no selection was made by user for 30 seconds, the proposed action       is confirmed and started automatically.        This prompt is also displayed for -ioff switch in WinRAR command line,       but not in console RAR command line.    10. Context menu in WinRAR file list provides "Open in internal viewer"       command for archive files. It can be helpful if you wish to view       the archive raw data in internal viewer. For example, to read       an email archive with UUE attachments included.        Usual "View" command always displays the archive contents.       If file is recognized as UUE archive, "View" would show UUE attachments.    11. Recovery record size is displayed on "Archive" page of file properties       invoked from Explorer context menu for archives in RAR5 format.       Previously there was only "Present" instead of exact size       for RAR5 archives.    12. When archiving from stdin with -si switch, RAR displays the current       amount of read bytes as the progress indicator.       13. If wrong password is specified when adding files to encrypted       solid RAR5 archive, a password will be requested again.       Previous versions cancelled archiving in this case.    14. If both options "Test archived files" and "Clear attribute "Archive"       after compressing" or their command line -t -ac equivalents are       enabled when archiving, "Archive" attribute will be cleared only       if test was completed successfully. Previously it was cleared even       when test reported errors.    15. NoDrives value containing the bit mask to hide drives can be now       read from "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\WinRAR\Policy" Registry key,       which allows to include it to winrar.ini if necessary.       Its "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies" locations       in HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE are also supported.        Previously only "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies"       in HKEY_CURRENT_USER was recognized.    16. Bugs fixed:        a) archive modification commands could fail for some ZIP archives          with file comments;        b) fixed a memory leak when reading contents of .tar.bz2 archives;        c) if source and resulting archive format is the same, the archive          conversion command didn't set the original archive time          to a newly created archive even if "Original archive time" option          was selected in archiving parameters;        d) if "Merge volumes contents" option in "Settings/File list" was          turned on, the folder packed size in WinRAR file list could be          less than expected when browsing a multivolume archive contents.          It didn't include the packed size of file parts continuing from          previous volume into calculation;        e) even if "Set file security" extraction option was turned off          by default, extraction commands in Explorer context menu still          attempted to restore NTFS file security data;        f) WinRAR could read data beyond the end of buffer and crash          when unpacking files from specially crafted ZIP archive.          We are thankful to Bakker working with Trend Micro Zero Day          Initiative for letting us know about this bug.          Version 6.11     1. Added support for Gz archives with large archive comments.       Previously the extraction command failed to unpack gz archives       if comment size exceeded 16 KB.     2. Archive comments in gz archives are displayed in the comment window       and recognized by "Show information" command. Large comments are       shown partially.              Previous versions didn't display Gzip comments.     3. Reserved device names followed by file extension, such as aux.txt,       are extracted as is in Windows 11 even without "Allow potentially       incompatible names" option or -oni command line switch.       Unlike previous Windows versions, Windows 11 treats such names       as usual files.        Device names without extension, such as aux, still require these       options to be unpacked as is regardless of Windows version.     4. Switch -mes can be also used to suppress the password prompt       and abort when adding files to encrypted solid archive.     5. Additional measures to prevent extracting insecure links are       implemented.     6. Bugs fixed:        a) if password exceeding 127 characters was entered when unpacking          an encrypted archive with console RAR, text after 127th character          could be erroneously recognized as user's input by different          prompts issued later;        b) wrong archived file time could be displayed in overwrite prompt          when extracting a file from ZIP archive. It happened if such          archive included extended file times and was created in another          time zone. It didn't affect the actual file time, which was set          properly upon extraction.      Version 6.10        1. WinRAR can unpack contents of .zst and .zipx archives utilizing       Zstandard algorithm.     2. Added support of Windows 11 Explorer context menus.        Beginning from Windows 11, an application can add only a single top       level command or submenu to Explorer context menu.              If "Cascaded context menus" in "Integration settings" dialog is on,       this single item is a submenu storing all necessary WinRAR commands.        If this option is off, only one extraction command for archives       and one archiving command for usual files are available.       You can select these commands with "Context menu items..." button       in "Integration settings" dialog.     3. "Legacy context menus" option in "Settings/Integration" dialog       can be used in Windows 11 if WinRAR commands are missing in       "Show more options" Windows legacy context menu or in context menus       of third party file managers. If WinRAR commands are already present       here, keep "Legacy context menus" option turned off to prevent       duplicating them.              This option is not available in Windows 10 and older.        4. Windows XP is not supported anymore. Minimum required operating       system version is Windows Vista.        5. "Close" item is added to "When done" list on "Advanced" page of       archiving dialog. It closes WinRAR window, when archiving is done.     6. "When done" list is added to "Options" page of extraction dialog.       It allows to select an action like turning a computer off       or closing WinRAR after completing extraction.        7. Switch -si can be used when extracting or testing to read archive       data from stdin, such as:           type docs.rar | rar x -si -o+ -pmypwd dummy docs\        Even though the archive name is ignored with this switch,       an arbitrary dummy archive name has to specified in the command line.                    Operations requiring backward seeks are unavailable in this mode.       It includes displaying archive comments, testing the recovery record,       utilizing the quick open information, processing multivolume archives.        Prompts requiring user interaction are not allowed.       Use -o[+|-|r], -p or -mes switches to suppress such prompts.        8. New -ep4 switch excludes the path prefix when archiving       or extracting if this path is found in the beginning of archived name.       Path is compared with names already prepared to store in archive,       without drive letters and leading path separators. For example:          rar a -ep4texts\books archive c:\texts\books\technical        removes "text\books" from archived names, so they start       from 'technical'.        9. New -mes switch skips encrypted files when extracting or testing.       It replaces the former -p- switch.    10. New -op switch sets the destination folder for 'x' and 'e'       extraction commands. Unlike  command line parameter,       this switch also accepts paths without trailing path separator       character.    11. If 'p' command is used to print a file to stdout, informational       messages are suppressed automatically to prevent them mixing       with file data.    12. "Generate archive name by mask" option and switch -ag treat only       first two 'M' characters after 'H' as minutes. Previously any       amount of such characters was considered as minutes.        It makes possible to place the time field before the date,       like -agHHMM-DDMMYY. Previous versions considered all 'M'       in this string as minutes.    13. Maximum allowed size of RAR5 recovery record is increased to 1000%       of protected data size. Maximum number of RAR5 recovery volumes       can be 10 times larger than protected RAR volumes.        Previous WinRAR versions are not able to use the recovery record       to repair broken archives if recovery record size exceeds 99%.       Similarly, previous versions cannot use recovery volumes       if their number is equal or larger than number of RAR volumes.    14. Warning is issued if entered password exceeds the allowed limit       of 127 characters and is truncated. Previously such passwords       had been truncated silently.    15. If archive includes reserved device names, the underscore character       is inserted in the beginning of such names when extracting.       For example, aux.txt is converted to _aux.txt. It is done to prevent       compatibility problems with software unable to process such names.        You can use "Allow potentially incompatible names" option       in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog or command line -oni switch       to avoid this conversion.      16. WinRAR attempts to reset the file cache before testing an archive.       It helps to verify actual data written to disk instead of reading       a cached copy.    17. Multiple -v switches specifying different sizes for different       volumes are now allowed also for ZIP archives:        WinRAR a -v100k -v200k -v300k arcname.zip        Previously multiple -v switches were supported only for       RAR archives.    18. Switches -sl and -sm can be used in WinRAR.exe command       line mode when extracting archives in any supported formats,       provided that such archive includes unpacked file sizes.       Previously these switches could filter files by size only in RAR       and ZIP archives.      19. Newer folder selection dialog is invoked when pressing "Browse" button       in WinRAR "Settings/Paths" page, "Repair" and "Convert" commands,       also as in few other similar places. Previously a simpler XP style       folder selection dialog was opened.      20. When restoring from tray after completing an operation,       WinRAR window is positioned under other opened windows,       to not interfere with current user activities.    21. "650 MB CD" is removed and "2 GB volumes" is added to the list of       predefined volume sizes in "Define volume sizes" dialog invoked       from WinRAR "Settings/Compression".    22. "Rename" command selects the file name part up to the final dot.       Previously it selected the entire name.    23. If SFX archive size exceeds 4 GB, an error message is issued       during compression, immediately after exceeding this threshold.       Previously this error was reported only after completing compression.        Executables of such size cannot be started by Windows.    24. Command line -en switch is not supported anymore.       It created RAR4 archives without the end of archive record.        End of archive record permits to gracefully skip external data       like digital signatures.    25. Bugs fixed:        a) when editing a file inside of .rar or .zip archive,          WinRAR created a new SFX archive instead of updating an existing           archive if "Create SFX archive" option was set in the default          compression profile;        b) the total progress could be displayed incorrectly when using          -oi, -f, -u switches or appropriate GUI options;        c) "Find files" command with "Use all tables" option and command line          "it" commands failed to find strings in UTF-16 encoding.      Version 6.02     1. ZIP SFX module refuses to process SFX commands stored in archive       comment if such comment is resided after beginning of Authenticode       digital signature. It is done to prevent possible attacks with       inclusion of ZIP archive into the signature body.        We already prohibited extracting contents of such malformed archives       in WinRAR 6.01.        We are thankful to Jacob Thompson - Mandiant Advantage Labs       for reporting this issue.     2. WinRAR uses https instead of http in the web notifier window,       home page and themes links. It also implements additional checks       within the web notifier. This is done to prevent a malicious web page       from executing existing files on a user's computer. Such attack       is only possible if the intruder has managed to spoof or otherwise       control user's DNS records. Some other factors are also involved       in limiting the practical application of this attack.        We would like to express our gratitude to Igor Sak-Sakovskiy       for bringing this issue to our attention.     3. Where appropriate, SFX archive displays the additional line       with detailed error information provided by operating system.        For example, previously such archive would display "Cannot create file"       message alone. Now this message is followed by a detailed reason       like access denied or file being used by another process.        In the past this extended error information was available in WinRAR,       but not in SFX archives.     4. Switch -idn hides archived names also in 'v' and 'l' commands.       It can be useful if only the archive type or total information       is needed.        5. If -ibck -ri switches are used together, WinRAR process       sets the priority specified in -ri switch. Previous versions ignored       -ri and set the priority to low in the presence of -ibck switch.     6. When using "File/Change drive" command, WinRAR saves the last folder       of previous drive and restores it if that drive is selected again       later.     7. Name of unpacking file is now included into WinRAR incorrect password       warning for RAR5 archives. It can be helpful when unpacking       a non-solid archive containing files encrypted with different passwords.        8. Bugs fixed:        a) "Convert archives" command issued erroneous "The specified password          is incorrect" message after succesfully converting RAR archive          with encrypted file names if new password was set and archive          was opened in WinRAR shell;        b) if command progress window was resized up and then quickly resized          down to original dimensions, window contents could be positioned          incorrectly.         Version 6.01     1. Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut selects the entire text in WinRAR comment       window.        2. If -idn switch is used together with -t or -df in console RAR       when archiving, it additionally disables "Deleting "       or "Testing " messages, normally issued by these switches.        Also -idn disables folder creation messages when extracting       a file to non-existing folder.     3. WinRAR and ZIP SFX module refuse to extract contents of ZIP SFX       archives if ZIP central directory is resided after beginning       of Authenticode digital signature. It is done to prevent possible       attacks with inclusion of ZIP archive into signature body.        4. Bugs fixed:        a) "Convert archives" command could incorrectly convert Unicode          comments in RAR archives.              b) if two archive information windows had been opened from Explorer          context menu, the compression ratio bar in the first window          could erroneously display a value for second archive.           It did not affect the ratio and other text details at the right          of window. Only the vertical bar at the left could be updated          to a wrong value;        c) if "Wait if other WinRAR copies are active" option was enabled          in extraction dialog, "Waiting for another WinRAR copy" title          was not set in command progress window while waiting;        d) when extracting a symbolic link, previous versions did not          overwrite existing symbolic links even if user requested it          in overwrite prompt.      Version 6.00     1. "Ignore" and "Ignore All" options are added to read error prompt.       "Ignore" allows to continue processing with already read file part       only and "Ignore All" does it for all future read errors.        For example, if you archive a file, which portion is locked by another       process, and if "Ignore" is selected in read error prompt,       only a part of file preceding the unreadable region will be saved       into archive.        It can help to avoid interrupting lengthy archiving operations,       though be aware that files archived with "Ignore" are incomplete.              If switch -y is specified, "Ignore" is applied to all files by default.        Previously available "Retry" and "Quit" options are still present       in read error prompt as well.     2. Exit code 12 is returned in the command line mode in case of read errors.       This code is returned for all options in the read error prompt,       including a newly introduced "Ignore" option.        Previously more common fatal error code 2 was returned for read errors.     3. If several archives are selected, "Extract archives to" option group       in "Options" page of extraction dialog can be used to place extracted       files to specified destination folder, to separate subfolders       in destination folder, to separate subfolders in archive folders       and directly to archive folders.              It replaces "Extract archives to subfolders" option and available       only if multiple archives are selected.     4. New -ad2 switch places extracted files directly to archive's own folder.       Unlike -ad1, it does not create a separate subfolder for each unpacked       archive.     5. "Additional switches" option in "Options" page of archiving       and extraction dialogs allows to specify WinRAR command line switches.       It might be useful if there is no option in WinRAR graphical interface       matching a switch.        Use this feature only if you are familiar with WinRAR command line       syntax and clearly understand what specified switches are intended for.     6. Compression parameters in "Benchmark" command are changed to       32 MB dictionary and "Normal" method. They match RAR5 default mode       and more suitable to estimate the typical performance of recent       WinRAR versions than former 4 MB "Best" intended for RAR4 format.        Latest "Benchmark" results cannot be compared with previous versions       directly. New parameters set produces different values, likely lower       because of eight times larger dictionary size.        7. When unpacking a part of files from solid volume set,       WinRAR attempts to skip volumes in the beginning and start       extraction from volume closest to specified file and with reset       solid statistics.        By default WinRAR resets the solid statistics in the beginning       of large enough solid volumes where possible. For such volumes       extracting a part of files from the middle of volume set can be       faster now.        It does not affect performance when all archived files are unpacked.     8. Previously WinRAR automatically resorted to extracting from       first volume, when user started extraction from non-first volume       and first volume was available. Now WinRAR does so only if all volumes       between first and specified are also available.     9. Warning is issued when closing WinRAR if one or more archived files       had been modified by external apps, but failed to be saved back to       archive, because an external app still locks them. Such warning       includes the list of modified files and proposes to quit immediately       and lose changes or return to WinRAR and close an editor app.        Previous versions issued a similar warning while editing a file,       but did not remind it again when quitting.    10. "Move to Recycle Bin" option in "Delete archive" options group       of extraction dialog places deleted archives to Recycle Bin       instead of deleting them permanently.    11. New "Clear history..." command in "Options" menu allows to remove       names of recently opened archives in "File" menu and clear drop down       lists with previously entered values in dialogs. For example,       these values include archive names in archiving dialog       and destination paths in extraction dialog.       12. "File time" options in "Advanced" part of extraction dialog are       now available for 7z archives. Additionally to modification time,       WinRAR can set creation and last access time when unpacking such       archives.    13. ""New" submenu items" options group is added to       "Settings/Integration/Context menu items..." dialog. You can use       these options to remove "WinRAR archive" and "WinRAR ZIP archive"       entries in "New" submenu of Windows context menu.        New state of these option is applied only after you press "OK"       both in "Context menu items" and its parent "Settings" dialog.    14. ,  and  commands can be inserted before the program       name in SFX "Setup" command to run a program in maximized,       minimized or hidden window. For example:        Setup=setup.exe    15. It is possible to specify an additional high resolution logo       for SFX module. If such logo is present, SFX module scales       and displays it in high DPI Windows mode, providing the better visible       quality compared to resizing the standard logo.              Use "High resolution SFX logo" in "Advanced SFX options" dialog       to define such logo. In command line mode add second -iimg switch       to set the high resolution logo.        Recommended size of high resolution logo PNG file is 186x604 pixels.    16. If archive currently opened in WinRAR shell was deleted or moved       by another program, WinRAR displays "Inaccessible" before archive name       in the window title. Also it flashes the window caption and taskbar       button.    17. "Total information" option in "Report" dialog is renamed to       "Headers and totals". Now it also adds headers of report columns       additionally to total information about listed files and archives.      18. If archive processing is started from Windows context menu       in multiple monitor system, WinRAR operation progress and dialogs       use the monitor with context menu.        While basic multiple monitor support was present in previous versions       shell extension for mouse driven commands, now it is extended to       operations initiated from keyboard and to dropping files to archives.    19. New -imon switch allows to select a monitor to display       WinRAR operation progress and dialogs in the command line mode.        Use -imon1 for primary and -imon2 for secondary monitor.       For example, "WinRAR x -imon2 arcname" will start extraction       on secondary monitor.        It works only in the command line mode and does not affect       interactive WinRAR graphical inteface also as console RAR.    20. Switch -idn hides archived names output in archiving, extraction       and some other commands in console RAR. Other messages and total       percentage are not affected.        You can use this switch to reduce visual clutter and console output       overhead when archiving or extracting a lot of small files.        Minor visual artifacts, such as percentage indicator overwriting       few last characters of error messages, are possible with -idn.      21. Former "-im - show more information" switch is changed to       "-idv - display verbose output" for consistency with console RAR       -id[c,d,p,q] message control options and avoid a potential name       conflict with newer -imon switch.        While WinRAR still recognizes both -im and -idv, in the future       -im support can be dropped.    22. It is allowed to add an optional %arcname% variable to compression       profile name. Such variable will be replaced with actual archive name.       It might be convenient when using with "Add to context menu" profile       option. For example, you can create ZIP compression profile       and set its name to "Add to %arcname%", to display it with actual       ZIP archive name in context menu.    23. Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Ins keyboard shortcuts can be used       in "Diagnostic messages" window to copy contents to clipboard.       24. More text is allowed in tray icon hint before a lengthy text       is truncated. Also such text is now truncated in the middle of string,       so both command type and completion percentage are still visible.    25. In case of clean install, if previous version compression profiles       are not present, "Files to store without compression" field       in newly created predefined compression profiles is set to:          *.rar *.zip *.cab *.7z *.ace *.arj *.bz2 *.gz *.lha *.lzh         *.taz *.tgz *.xz *.txz        You can change this field and save a modified value to compression       profile later.              Previous versions set this field to blank for clean install.    26. Destination path history in extraction dialog treats paths like       'folder' and 'folder\' as the same path and displays only 'folder'       entry. Previously they occupied two entries in the history.    27. "Enable Itanium executable compression" GUI option and -mci command       line switch are removed. Optimized compression of Itanium executables       is not supported anymore. WinRAR still can decompress already existing       archives utilizing Itanium executable compression.    28. Bugs fixed:        a) "Lock", "Comment" and "Protect" commands could not be applied          to several archives selected in WinRAR file list at once;        b) SFX archive process did not terminate after completing          extraction in Windows 10 if archive comment included "Setup"          and "SetupCode" commands, did not include "TempMode" command          and setup program was running for more than 8 minutes;        c) compression profiles with quote character in profile name          could not be invoked from Explorer context menu.     ``` |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
