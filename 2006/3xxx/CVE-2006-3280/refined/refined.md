Specifically, the HTML Document object fails to enforce the cross-domain security model when it encounters an HTTP redirect to a site that uses an HTTP Cache-Control header of \"private.\"\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities:\nCross-domain vulnerability in how Internet Explorer handles redirected object data.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nAn attacker may be able to obtain access to web content in another domain. This is similar to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\nAttack vectors:\nBy convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message).\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAttacker needs to host a specially crafted HTML document or embed it in an HTML email. They would need to persuade the user to view the malicious content. The target web content must use gzip encoding or some other compression type supported by Internet Explorer and be cached on the client side."

        "information": "Root cause:\nAn information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer in the way that a redirect is handled. Internet Explorer incorrectly interprets the location of a Web page after a redirect to a Web page that uses gzip encoding or some other compression type supported by Internet Explorer. In addition, data from Web pages in other domains or Internet Explorer zones could only be exposed to an attacker if those Web pages allow caching of their content.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities:\nInformation disclosure vulnerability due to incorrect handling of redirects and compression.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from a Web page in another Internet Explorer domain.\n\nAttack vectors:\nAn attacker could construct a specially crafted Web page that, if viewed by a user, could allow for information disclosure. This can include hosting a malicious website, or embedding the malicious content in web sites accepting user-provided content, or advertisements, and compromised web sites. An attacker would have to persuade users to visit these websites. An attacker can also send a specially crafted HTML email.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nThe attacker would have to host a website or send an email with specially crafted content. They would have to persuade a user to click a link or view the content. The target web page must use gzip or other supported compression and must allow caching."
