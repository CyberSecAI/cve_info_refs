    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3074",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV) kernel-mode components have vulnerabilities due to improper validation of user-mode pointers in modified system services and custom system services.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the improper validation of user-mode pointers when KAV modifies the NtOpenProcess function and in several custom system services. KAV uses hardcoded addresses and does not properly validate user mode pointers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of user-mode pointers.",
        "Hardcoding of user address space limits."
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can cause system instability and potentially bring down the system by providing invalid user-mode pointers to KAV's modified or custom system services.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Calling modified or custom system services with invalid user-mode pointer arguments."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable system services (NtOpenProcess, KAVService10, KAVService11 etc) with controlled pointer parameters."
