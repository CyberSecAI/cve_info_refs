{
  "CVE-2006-3459": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities, including stack buffer overflows, heap overflows, and integer overflows, were discovered in the libtiff library. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by tricking a user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted TIFF image, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the target application.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of TIFF image data during processing, leading to various buffer overflows and integer handling issues.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflows",
      "Heap buffer overflows",
      "Integer overflows",
        "Insufficient input validation",
      "Unchecked arithmetic operations"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash the application) or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application by enticing them to open a specially crafted TIFF file.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted TIFF image file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious TIFF file and convince a user or system to process it. This can be done through various means such as embedding the image on a website, sending it via email, or having a server process it automatically."
