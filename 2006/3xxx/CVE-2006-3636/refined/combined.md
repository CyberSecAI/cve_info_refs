How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0600)

## Topic

Updated mailman packages that fix security issues are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mailman is a program used to help manage email discussion lists.

A flaw was found in the way Mailman handled MIME multipart messages. An
attacker could send a carefully crafted MIME multipart email message to a
mailing list run by Mailman which caused that particular mailing list
to stop working. (CVE-2006-2941)

Several cross-site scripting (XSS) issues were found in Mailman. An
attacker could exploit these issues to perform cross-site scripting attacks
against the Mailman administrator. (CVE-2006-3636)

Red Hat would like to thank Barry Warsaw for disclosing these vulnerabilities.

Users of Mailman should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

On behalf of the GNU Mailman development team, I'm please to announce
GNU Mailman 2.1.9.  This is primarily a security and bug fix release
and it is highly recommended that all sites upgrade to this version.
Mailman 2.1.9 also contains support for two new languages: Arabic and
Vietnamese.

Mailman is free software for managing email mailing lists and e-
newsletters.  Mailman is used for all the python.org and
SourceForge.net mailing lists, as well as at hundreds of other sites.

For more information, including download links, please see:

	<http://www.list.org>
	<http://mailman.sf.net>
	<http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman>

A more detailed change list is included below.

Enjoy,
- -Barry

2.1.9 (12-Sep-2006)

   Security

     - A malicious user could visit a specially crafted URI and
inject an
       apparent log message into Mailman's error log which might
induce an
       unsuspecting administrator to visit a phishing site.  This has
been
       blocked.  Thanks to Moritz Naumann for its discovery.

     - Fixed denial of service attack which can be caused by some
       standards-breaking RFC 2231 formatted headers.  CVE-2006-2941.

     - Several cross-site scripting issues have been fixed.  Thanks
to Moritz
       Naumann for their discovery.  CVE-2006-3636

     - Fixed an unexploitable format string vulnerability.  Discovery
and fix
       by Karl Chen.  Analysis of non-exploitability by Martin 'Joey'
Schulze.
       Also thanks go to Lionel Elie Mamane.  CVE-2006-2191.

   Internationalization

     - New languages: Arabic, Vietnamese.

   Bug fixes and other patches

     - Fixed Decorate.py so that characters in message header/footer
which
       are not in the character set of the list's language are
ignored rather
       than causing shunted messages (1507248).

     - Switchboard.py - Closed very tiny holes at the upper ends of
queue
       slices that could result in unprocessable queue entries.
Improved FIFO
       processing when two queue entries have the same timestamp.

# Mailman: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200609-12**

Mailman has multiple vulnerable that can result in Denial of Service, log
file injection and XSS.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/mailman** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.9\_rc1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.9\_rc1** |

### Background

Mailman is a Python based mailing list server with an extensive web
interface.

### Description

Mailman fails to properly handle standards-breaking RFC 2231 formatted
headers. Furthermore, Moritz Naumann discovered several XSS
vulnerabilities and a log file injection.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause Mailman to
stop processing mails, to inject content into the log file or to
execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the administrator
or mailing list user's browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mailman users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/mailman-2.1.9_rc1"
```

## Details

Steve Alexander discovered that mailman did not properly handle

attachments with special filenames. A remote user could exploit that

to stop mail delivery until the server administrator manually cleaned

these posts. ([CVE-2006-2941](/security/CVE-2006-2941))

Various cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been reported by

Barry Warsaw. By using specially crafted email addresses, names, and

similar arbitrary user-defined strings, a remote attacker could

exploit this to run web script code in the list administrator's

web browser. ([CVE-2006-3636](/security/CVE-2006-3636))

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
