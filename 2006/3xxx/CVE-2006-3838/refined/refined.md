{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The eIQnetworks Enterprise Security Analyzer Syslog server contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to processing long strings transmitted to the listening TCP port.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Syslog daemon, syslogserver.exe, during the processing of long strings sent to the listening TCP port.",
        "A stack based buffer overflow occurs in EnterpriseSecurityAnalyzer.exe when processing long arguments to the LICMGR_ADDLICENSE command. The service binds to TCP port 10616 by default."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of eIQnetworks Enterprise Security Analyzer.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending long strings to the listening TCP port. Authentication is not required.",
    "The overflow in the LICMGR_ADDLICENSE command can be triggered remotely by sending long arguments to the service listening on TCP port 10616. Authentication is not required."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required."
