How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-52

## PAC privilege escalation using Function.prototype.call

Announced
July 25, 2006
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.0.3

### Description

moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reports that a malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could
serve a PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by
setting the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on
a privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox. By redirecting
the victim to a specially-crafted URL -- easily done since the PAC script
controls which proxy to use -- the URL "hostname" can be executed as
privileged script.

A malicious proxy server can perform spoofing attacks on the user so
it was already important to use a trustworthy PAC server.

### Workaround

Disable Proxy AutoConfig (the default setting). If that is impractical
ensure that the PAC server and proxy you use are trustworthy and reached
over a trusted network. Do not use the WPAD setting if you have a mobile
computer that is ever used outside of the trusted network (such as at
a WiFi hotspot).

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla
package are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Seamonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This
update deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in
favor of the supported Seamonkey Suite.

This update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,
CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,
CVE-2006-3812)

Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey.
(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,
CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

Two flaws were found in the way Seamonkey-mail displayed malformed
inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing
a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the
user running Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed
Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web
page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer
could miss due to a malformed "script" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack
or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).
(CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

A form file upload flaw was found in the way Seamonkey handled javascript
input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local
file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Seamonkey called the
crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the
browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return
specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy
restrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)

A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A
malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was
called. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible
to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Seamonkey version 1.0.3 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Multilib systems may experience difficulty if trying to specify the package
by name to the Update Agent via a command line argument. This can be
solved by executing the following commands:

up2date seamonkey; up2date seamonkey-nss seamonkey-nspr

# Mozilla SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-02**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla SeaMonkey.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

### Background

The Mozilla SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as "Mozilla Application Suite".

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files.
* Developers in the Mozilla community
  looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
  Mozilla clients, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code by
  a remote attacker.
* "shutdown" reports that cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
  XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
  appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
  navigated to the target site.
* "shutdown" reports that scripts
  granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
  equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
  allowed to "read" into a privileged context.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4"
  reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could serve a
  PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by setting
  the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on a
  privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
  parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
  (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined by
  script (also ECMA-specified behavior).
* Igor Bukanov and
  shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
  could delete a temporary object that was in active use.
* Georgi
  Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long strings in
  the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String objects as well
  as string function arguments.
* H. D. Moore reported a testcase
  that was able to trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage
  collection deleted a temporary variable still being used in the
  creation of a new Function object.
* A malicious page can hijack
  native DOM methods on a document object in another domain, which will
  run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.
* Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
  to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
  happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer
  object.
* An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero
  Day Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
  properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.
* Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away.

### Impact

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.3"
```

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=337389#c0)• 19 years ago |
|  | |

It is possible to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges by combining a PAC
and an html.
This exploit uses the fact that the following code works as |eval("code")|.
var obj = {
valueOf : function() { return eval; }
};
Function.prototype.call.call(obj, "", "code");
PAC script can make sandbox.valueOf() return a privileged eval (e.g.
myIpAddress.eval), and assign Function.prototype.call to FindProxyForURL.
this.valueOf = function() { return myIpAddress.eval; };
this.FindProxyForURL = Function.prototype.call;
When attempting to load a url "<http://x(y)/>", the arguments that are passed to
FindProxyForURL are: testURI = "<http://x(y)/>", testHost = "x(y)". Thus,
testHost can be used as a JS code. (testURI is also valid JS code, but it's
harmless, since http: is a label and //x(y)/ is a single line comment.)
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a PAC file testcase on web server, or save it to local hard disk.
2. Set Automatic proxy configuration URL to its URL.
3. Open an html testcase.
An alert dialog that shows Components.stack will appear.

I think this bug could be fixed by using evalInSandbox to call FindProxyForURL.
var s = "FindProxyForURL(" + uneval(testURI) + "," + uneval(testHost) + ");";
return Components.utils.evalInSandbox(s, this.\_sandBox);

|  | |

Hmm, I think a simpler solution would be to just use:
this.\_sandBox.FindProxyForURL(testURI, testHost);
to avoid the decompilation/recompilation. Is there a way to attack that? What other advantages that I'm not seeing do we gain by going back through evalInSandbox?
I chose not to go this way last time since it changes behavior when the PAC script sets FindProxyForURL on subsequent calls to it, but now I don't think that's too bad.

The testcases I've attached can also exploit this.\_sandBox.FindProxyForURL.

Sorry, I wasn't thinking all the way through the exploit. This is obviously the best solution, if not the most performant, all code execution happens inside the sandbox, so any hack attempts bounce off of the walls, as they were.

Indeed
OK.. how bad is this from a perf point of view? Keep in mind that this code will be executed once for every single URI that is loaded by the browser.

This is fairly thrashy because it creates a new context for every call. I'll try to fix that first... I'm not really sure what to do about this bug in the meantime. The effects might even be tolerable as is...

Hacky, yet speedy alternative
sr=dveditz
I have a sinking feeling moz\_bug\_r\_a4 will quickly bypass this as well, but at the moment I can't see how. The next step is to rewrite PAC in C++, though, so this is worth a try.

[Don't expose privileged functions](attachment.cgi?id=224729&action=diff)

This brings back sandbox.importFunction. With this patch, there are no more chrome functions in the sandbox for malicious scripts to pull eval off of. This method won't work for GreaseMonkey, but since GreaseMonkey doesn't try to call functions pulled out of the sandbox, I think it can get away without using this sort of hack.

Does the patch in [bug 314874](/show_bug.cgi?id=314874 "VERIFIED FIXED - Function.call/apply pass thisArg.valueOf() as the this value when thisArg is not a primitive value") fix this (I think this depends on our "extension"/broken interpretation of executing "valueOf" on things that are already objects, in call and apply)?

# USN-361-1: Mozilla vulnerabilities

10 October 2006

Mozilla vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious URL. ([CVE-2006-2788](/security/CVE-2006-2788), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805), [CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806),

[CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4568](/security/CVE-2006-4568), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A bug was found in the script handler for automatic proxy

configuration. A malicious proxy could send scripts which could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2006-3808](/security/CVE-2006-3808))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-03**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla Firefox.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a redesign of the Mozilla Navigator component. The
goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone browser application.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files.
* Developers in the Mozilla community
  looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
  Mozilla clients.
* "shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
  XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
  appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
  navigated to the target site.
* "shutdown" reports that scripts
  granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
  equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
  allowed to "read" into a privileged context.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4"
  reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could serve a
  PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by setting
  the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on a
  privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
  parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
  (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined by
  script (also ECMA-specified behavior).
* Igor Bukanov and
  shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
  could delete a temporary object that was in active use.
* Georgi
  Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long strings in
  the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String objects as well
  as string function arguments.
* H. D. Moore reported a testcase
  that was able to trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage
  collection deleted a temporary variable still being used in the
  creation of a new Function object.
* A malicious page can hijack
  native DOM methods on a document object in another domain, which will
  run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.
* Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
  to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
  happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer
  object.
* An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero
  Day Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
  properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.
* Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away.

### Impact

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.5"
```

Users of the binary package should upgrade as well:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.5"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We strive to protect communities of customers, contributors, and partners from digital security threats. We believe open source principles are the best way to achieve this.

![Illustration of secure applications and technology within the cloud](/rhdc/managed-files/RH_BRAND_007283_01_MECH_Security_FullColor_Grey_0.svg)

## Red Hat's security principles

Our open source security principles are baked into our products, services, and support

#### Defense in depth

Failure or compromise of a single layer or component of a system should not compromise the system as a whole.

#### Separation of duty

No one person, entity, or system identity should have full control or access to all elements of a policy, process, or system.

#### Secure by design

Security is not an add-on, afterthought, or checklist.

#### Secure by default

The default system configuration should have all reasonable security controls enabled and all services and features not needed for basic operation disabled.

#### Least privilege

Individuals, system identities, roles, entities, or execution contexts, be they human or automation, should be scoped to include only the access to resources required to complete the assigned and expected task or business duties.

#### Transparency

The open source principle of transparency should also apply to security issues and data, including designs, algorithms, and source code, all of which should be freely available when reasonable.

#### Understand the threat

Effective defense of a system must consider the nature of the actual threat or risk that is being mitigated or defended against so the appropriate responses are utilized.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
