A query like "select str_to_date( 1, NULL );" crashes mysqld.
This affects:
  Woody: mysql-server 		3.23.x
  Sarge: mysql-server 		4.0.x
  Sarge: mysql-server-4.1	4.1.x
Unstable/Testing is already fixed.

We are already preparing a DSA for Woody and Sarge.

I found out that 3.23 (woody) and 4.0 (sarge) are not vulnerable as the
function str_to_date() was introduced in 4.1.1.

Packages for 4.1 (sarge) can be found on
  <http://www.lathspell.de/linux/debian/mysql/sarge-4.1/>

The patch from the last DSA has been renamed from
64_SECURITY_CVE-2006-XXXX.dpatch to 64_SECURITY_CVE-2006-2753.dpatch,
I hope you don't mind that this is in the .diff.

The new CVE-Id should, once it is known, replace the XXXX in
* the 65_SECURITY_CVE-2006-XXXX.dpatch filename
* the comment in this file (2x) and
* the debian/changelog file (1x)

I verified that with this patch the function returns NULL and no longer
crashs the server.

is this supposed to work also on mysql command line client? I cannot reproduce
it. Could you please list the step to reproduce this bug?

Er, "subject says all" :) Just type "SELECT str_to_date(1, NULL);" and watch your connection
go away. If you get "NULL" as result without any error message then your version is safe.

ahem, I didn't read your second message to this bug stating that sarge's 4.0
isn't affected, sorry for the noise :)

What's the current status of this prepared security update? (Moritz?)
The current packages on lathepell.de contain now the official MySQL
patch für the second bug so there's not much work needed anymore.
We just need a CVE id for it.

Both bugs only affects Sarge 4.1, not Woody 3.23. Sarge 4.0 or Sid 5.0.

It's currently building.

I'm CCing Steven for this one. As it's now kind of public in the MySQL
database, assigning an ID from the Debian CNA pool might lead to clashes.

Use [CVE-2006-3469](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3469)

Is this "public enough" for me to update the CVE descriptions, or should I
leave them as reserved for now?  CVE will probably be the first point of
widespread disclosure.

Speaking of MySQL, the following item recently showed up in an FrSIRT
advisory.  In light of last week's vendor-sec discussions, let me know if
there's too much guesswork going on here :)

Status: Candidate
URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3486>
Acknowledged: yes changelog
Announced: 20060704
Flaw: buf

Reference: FRSIRT:ADV-2006-2700
Reference: URL:<http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2006/2700>

Off-by-one buffer overflow in the
Instance_options::complete_initialization function in
instance_options.cc in the Instance Manager in MySQL before 5.0.23 and
5.1 before 5.1.12 might allow local users to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via unspecified vectors, which triggers the
overflow when the convert_dirname function is called.

Analysis:
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: MySQL 5.0.23 changelog " A buffer overwrite error in
Instance Manager caused a crash. (Bug#20622)"

ACCURACY: it is not clear whether this is security-relevant, as the
input vectors are unknown.

I asked FrSIRT and MySQL if they have more information, and report back if I
get any news.

Debian: MySQL versions 3.23, 4.0 and 4.1 are not affected as they did not
have the file in question. 5.0 (etch/sid-only) is currently beeing built
(it's on the ftp servers since days but not yet officially announced nor
linked on the web page, strange releases they made :))

Hello Moritz & Co

Attached is a mail from mysql. It seems to be ok for them if we release our
patch even if they need another week to release a new 4.1 version.
(I reported it on Jun 27 and they provided me a fix on Jul 5 so I guess
we gave them time enough, given that the bug was public in the BTS)

So go ahead!

bye,

-christian-

Ok, will push it out once all builds are available:
The arm buildd seems currently down and the m68k ran out of diskspace (only
10 megabytes available), so it might take a few more days.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Thank you for a bug report. Verified just as described on 5.0.18-BK ():

mysql> select str_to_date( 1, NULL );
ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query

In the error log I've got:

[openxs@Fedora 5.0]$ tail -50 var/Fedora.err   /tmp/mys
We will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help diagnose
the problem, but since we have already crashed, something is definitely wrong
and this may fail.

key_buffer_size=8388600
read_buffer_size=131072
max_used_connections=1
max_connections=100
threads_connected=1
It is possible that mysqld could use up to
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_connections = 225791

Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

Attempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
Cannot determine thread, fp=0xb8e125f4, backtrace may not be correct.

Please read <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Using_stack_trace.html> and follow
instructions on how to resolve the stack trace. Resolved

resolve it

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
