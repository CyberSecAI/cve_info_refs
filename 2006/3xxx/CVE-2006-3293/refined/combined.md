| [Description](#c0)  Michiel Muhlenbaumer    2002-03-24 00:38:21 UTC  ``` I was installing KDE3_rc3, using the howto at  <http://www.gentoo.org/~danarmak/kde3-pre.html> yesterday. But the 'emerge'  proces failed at the emerge of kdemultimedia-3.0_rc3. It gave this error:  motif_p.c: In function `motif_pipe_error': motif_p.c:58: `errno' undeclared (first use in this function) motif_p.c:58: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once motif_p.c:58: for each function it appears in.) make[3]: *** [motif_p.o] Error 1 make[3]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/kdemultimedia- 3.0_rc3/work/kdemultimedia-3.0rc3/kmidi/TIMIDITY' make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make[2]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/kdemultimedia- 3.0_rc3/work/kdemultimedia-3.0rc3/kmidi' make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1 make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/kdemultimedia- 3.0_rc3/work/kdemultimedia-3.0rc3' make: *** [all] Error 2 !!! ERROR: The ebuild did not complete successfully. !!! Function kde_src_compile, Line -38, Exitcode 2 !!! died running emake, kde_src_compile:make  But when i manullay, unpack, configure, make and make install, it does works.  So I think there's an error in your ebuild scripts. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-25 03:36:19 UTC  ``` First of all, I advice you to use the cvs ebuilds, not the RC3 ones, because many bugs have been fixed in the KDE cvs since RC3.  Now, this is a known error and we have a patch for it. The first order of business is to check that the patch was applied successfully. Please capture and paste here the first lines of the kdemultimedia emere output; the patching is done near the unpacking.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michiel Muhlenbaumer    2002-03-25 05:59:06 UTC  ``` I used the CVS build (as described in the howto on your homepage)...But I'll try it again in an hour... ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Daniel Mettler    2002-03-27 10:17:21 UTC  ``` i do not know whether this error is related to this bug, but when i try to  emerge arts-1.0.0.ebuild there is a similar error msg:  hal arts # emerge arts Calculating dependencies. done! >>> emerge kde-base/arts-1.0.0 to / alsa alsa >>> Unpacking source... ERROR: Offline mode, but module not found. Aborting.  !!! ERROR: The ebuild did not complete successfully. !!! Function cvsup_src_unpack, Line -38, Exitcode 1 !!! died running cvsup_fetch  !!! emerge aborting on  /usr/portage/kde-base/arts/arts-1.0.0.ebuild .  strange, isn't it?   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-27 13:19:10 UTC  ``` Well, it certainly isn't related.    Normally the error means you haven't checked out the module, but also haven't set KCVSUP_SERVER so  that the ebuild can check it out itself. If this isn't the case, please say so.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Daniel Mettler    2002-03-27 17:24:04 UTC  ``` i have the following settings in /etc/make.conf:  KSOURCE_TOP_DIR=/usr/src/kde KCVS_SERVER=anoncvs.kde.org:/home/kde KCVSUP_SERVER=cvsup.kde.org  and actually i did everything according to your guide (created directories,  emerged qt-3.0.3.1 first etc.  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-27 17:46:52 UTC  ``` The sad truth is that I don't use the cvsup fetching myself and so it isn't nearly as well  tested/typo-proof as the cvs one. And since the KDE 3.0-final release is in a week's time or less,  this isn't a top priority for me at the moment. I will check it sometime, as part of a general cvsup  checkup/fixup.    Right now I recommend you use cvs (remove the KCVSUP_SERVER setting). There's very little difference  user-wise (assuming it works).  ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-27 17:48:02 UTC  ``` The sad truth is that I don't use the cvsup fetching myself and so it isn't nearly as well tested/typo-proof as the cvs one.

ERROR: The ebuild did not complete successfully. !!! Function kde_src_compile, Line -43, Exitcode 1 !!! died running ./configure, kde_src_compile:configure  !!! emerge aborting on  /usr/portage/kde-base/arts/arts-1.0.0.ebuild .  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-28 03:57:29 UTC  ``` As I wrote on gentoo-user, the new autoconf and automake packages are the cause of the failure. That's curently being investigated, for now if you want kde cvs to compile, unmask and emerge the older sys-devel/autoconf-2.1x and sys-devel/automake-1.4x. AFAIK no other pakage has problems with the new ones, and kde release versions (e.g. 3.0-final) don't need autoconf anyway, so it's your choice.   ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-05-27 14:15:14 UTC  ``` Curios that this is still open. Well, I'm closing it now. Both the  kdemultimedia compile problem and the automake/autoconf version problem were  fixed long ago.  ``` |  |
