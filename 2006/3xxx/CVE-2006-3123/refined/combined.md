How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : cfs
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-3123
Debian Bug     : 371076

Carlo Contavalli discovered an integer overflow in CFS, a cryptographic
filesystem, which allows local users to crash the encryption daemon.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-15sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-17.

We recommend that you upgrade your cfs package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

```
Package: cfs
Version: 1.4.1-16
Severity: important

Well, after a couple months, a couple days ago I just updated
the whole system. Still trying to understand which is the cause,
but when writing 'some files' cfsd crashes with a SIGSEGV
and leaves my directory unusable.

  I've been using cfsd for years now, and I don't believe the
directory to be corrupted. The application causing the problem
is probably procmail.

By recompiling with nostrip,noopt, I get the following gdb backtrace:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Hi Carlo, I tried to reproduce it, but failed to crash cfsd with
SIGSEGV.  Maybe it only happens with this specific file when written to
the directory.

Can you try to construct a simple test case to reproduce the crash, so
that I can start debugging?  I'm thinking of something like:

 cmkdir foo; cattach foo; cat somefile >/crypt/foo/bar;

makes cfsd crash.

Thanks, Gerrit.

ok, I just had some time to investigate the problem. I've attacched
the strace of the fetchmail process that caused the crash and
the strace of cfsd.

The problem is quite simple: I didn't realize one of the mailbox
files (a backup file) passed the 2.0G of size. So, the upgrade
of the system has nothing to do with the crash.

> Can you try to construct a simple test case to reproduce the crash, so
> that I can start debugging?  I'm thinking of something like:
sorry for the last report, but I really was in a hurry, didn't
have enough time to produce a test case, and was really scared
by the bug :)

Now, it is quite simple to reproduce: append some data to a 2.0G
file under an encrypted mount, and you should see the crash.

I think the problem is in:

dodecrypt(k,s,l,salt,vect)
     cfskey *k;
     char *s;
     int l;
     int salt;
     char *vect;

where salt is used as an index in an array:

   s[i+j] ^= k->secmask[(i+j+salt)%smsize];

However, dodecrypt is almost always called with something like:

     dodecrypt(key,buf,iolen,begin,vect);

where begin is declared as:

     u_long begin;

so, if begin is greater than 2.0G (allowed for an unsigned long),
dodecrypt gets a negative salt (int). The negative salt leads to
a negative module to be calculated, underflowing secmask by a
random amount of data which might be big, depending on smsize.

A quick and dirty fix would probably be to change:

dodecrypt(k,s,l,salt,vect)
     cfskey *k;
     char *s;
     int l;
     u_long salt;
     char *vect;

I don't have enough knowledge about NFS interfaces and 64 bits
offset support when accessing files (lseek64, ...) to know if
that fix would just be enough, or would just "delay problems"
until the 4G limits is hit... for sure, the daemon shouldn't
read some random data from memory, and shouldn't crash, ...

Cheers,
Carlo

Thanks Carlo, I can reproduce it now just fine.

Yes, your analysis is correct IMO.

I suggest this patch based on your suggestion, it fixes the problem you
report.  On my sid system, I wasn't able to create a file greater than
2GB in a crypted directory anyway, due to EFBIG.

Thanks, Gerrit.
