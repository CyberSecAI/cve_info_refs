Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: CRLF Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when handling HTTP requests, allowing injection of Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application is vulnerable to CRLF injection in HTTP headers. The provided example shows how it's possible to insert CRLF characters within the cookie value, possibly to manipulate HTTP responses.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of CRLF injection can lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **HTTP Response Splitting:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the server response, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or cache poisoning.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker may manipulate the cookie in the response.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By injecting CRLF sequences (%0d%0a) into user-controlled data, such as the cookie or other headers passed in HTTP requests.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when building SQL queries, specifically in the `post_id` parameter and the search function.
*   **Weaknesses:** SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the following areas:
    *   `index.php?mode=viewid&post_id=`: The `post_id` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
    *   Search function: The `keyword` parameter in the search functionality is also vulnerable to SQL injection.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the `post_id` parameter or the `keyword` parameter in the search function through HTTP requests. Examples provided in the text:  `1' having '1'='1'--` or `' or 'x'='x--`
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory includes a basic patch attempt for the search function, using `ereg` to check for invalid characters, followed by `preg_replace` which might not be sufficient for complete protection against SQL injection.
*   The vendor was contacted, but did not respond.

This analysis provides more detail than a typical CVE description, which would likely just state the presence of CRLF and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
