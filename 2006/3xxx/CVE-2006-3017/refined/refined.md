      "description": "Due to a bug found in PHP's zend_hash_del() function, a remote attacker could possibly force PHP to bypass the variable initialization stage in PHP scripts using the unset() PHP function. If the \"register_globals\" setting was enabled for PHP by default, this would result in a security issue. However as Red Hat Enterprise Linux has this disabled by default, it is not susceptible out of the box.",
