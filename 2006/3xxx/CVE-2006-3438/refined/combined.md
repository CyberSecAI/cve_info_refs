### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves two newly discovered vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

User interaction is required for an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities.

We recommend that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Hyperlink Object Library. This problem exists because of an unchecked buffer in the code that is used for handling hyperlinks. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious hyperlink which could potentially lead to remote code execution if a user clicks a malicious link within an Office file or e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful an attacker must persuade a user to click a link in e-mail message or open an Office file and click a link within that file.

#### Workarounds for Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. A workaround may not block all attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Modify the Access Control List to deny access to Hlink.dll for all users**
  Disabling the Hlink.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Hlink.dll registry key:

  + Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cacls "%windir%\system32\hlink.dll" /d everyone** (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.
* **Modify the Access Control List to disable the HLINK registry key**
  Modifying the Access Control List on the â**HLINK**â registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the registry key, follow these steps.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  **For Windows 2000**

  **Note** Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, expand **CLSID**, and then click **{79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}.**
  3. Click **Security**, and then click **Permissions**.
  4. Click to clear the **Allow Inheritable Permissions from the parent to propagate to this object** check box. You are prompted to click **Copy**, **Remove**, or **Cancel**. Click **Remove**, and then click **OK**.
  5. You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click **Yes** when you are prompted to do so.

  **For Windows XP Service Pack 1 or later operating systems**

  **Note** Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedit**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, expand **CLSID**, and then click **{79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}**.
  3. Click **Edit**, and then click **Permissions**.
  4. Click **Advanced.**
  5. Click to clear the **Inherit from parent the permission entries that apply to child objects. Include these with entries explicitly defined here.** check box. You are prompted to click **Copy**, **Remove**, or **Cancel**. Click **Remove**, and then check **OK**.
  6. You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click **Yes**, and then click **OK** to close the **Permissions for {79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}** dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Do not click on hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents from untrusted sources.**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125). For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). This security update will also be available through the [Microsoft Update Web site](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate).

**Restart Requirement**

This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart.

To help reduce the chance that a reboot will be required, stop all affected services and close all applications that may use the affected files prior to installing the security update. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887012).

**Removal Information**

To remove this security update, use Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

System administrators can also use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$NTUninstallKB920670$\Spuninst folder.

When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and Small Business Server 2000:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hlink.dll | 5.2.3790.2748 | 22-Jul-2006 | 03:38 | 72,704 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB920670\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 920670 security update into the Windows installation source files.
