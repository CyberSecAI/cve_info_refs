How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 and 1.3.11sr7

[![Security](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/security.png "Security")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/Security)

JPCERT/CC informed us about a possible [XSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSS "Click to look up 'XSS' on Wikipedia") in the comment handling that we're fixing with the following releases:

* **Geeklog 1.4.0sr5**, available as a [complete tarball](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=735) and as an [upgrade from 1.4.0sr4](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=734).
* **Geeklog 1.3.11sr7**, available as an [upgrade from 1.3.11sr6](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=733) and as a [combo update](http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=732) from any other 1.3.11 release.

Upgrades should be straightforward as you'll only have to replace one file (lib-comment.php for Geeklog 1.4.0 and comment.php for Geeklog 1.3.11).

### Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 and 1.3.11sr7

Authored by: [TrappedOnEarth](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=11452) on Monday, July 17 2006 @ 02:16 am EDT

I just noticed something odd. After replacing my lib-comment.php
file (updating from 1.4.0sr4 to 1.4.0sr5), when I add a comment on my
site now, the preview is not working correctly. It is only showing the first
few lines and is ignoring the html formating.

I tried it using Safari and Firefox with the same results. Part my
reason for posting this comment here now is to see if it happens here as
well or not. I just tested it here as well by clicking the preview and it
only displays the first few lines and ignores the html formatting.

It seems to be limited to only previewing a comment, because when
I hit submit, the complete comment does post along with the html
formating.

Whoops. It's a bit overzealous now with the filtering. Looks like we have to release a fix for the fix ... Sorry about that.

Will you release it under a new name?

I wish you'd apply my new patch (supposedly it's new but it was in the forums since 2005) for "a public dummy site mail and a protected real site mail" as it's kind of annoying having to keep updating it manually inside each new version of system/lib-common.php...).

### Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 and 1.3.11sr7

Authored by: [griffman](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=984) on Wednesday, July 19 2006 @ 05:32 pm EDT

Any update on the fix for the fix? It seems a choice of two bad options -- run with the hole plugged but comment preview borked, or have comment preview with a security hole...

-rob.

### Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 and 1.3.11sr7

Authored by: [Dirk](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=408) on Thursday, July 20 2006 @ 02:01 am EDT

Basically, it's [this](http://project.geeklog.net/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/Geeklog-1.x/system/lib-comment.php.diff?r1=1.40;r2=1.41;cvsroot=geeklog;f=h). I'm seeing extra backslashes on one of my sites, though, and I have had virtually no time to even attempt to roll out a new release, sorry.

bye, Dirk

### Geeklog 1.4.0sr5 and 1.3.11sr7

Authored by: [kegazow](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=12738) on Tuesday, July 18 2006 @ 12:06 am EDT

One thing that I noticed, as a user new to php and new to Geeklog, was the security notice on the site reviewing the site on a cursory level to make sure things were OK. I found out the hard way, however, that installing Geeklog with cPanel/Fantastico is just plain bad. Rather than relive all of the details, you can check it out [here](http://gazow.net/article.php?story=20060717223150571).

The short of the long is this: how hard would it be to amp up the security check in subsequent releases to check for the path to some of the core components (i.e. config.php, plugins, logs, etc), and if they are the same as the root (i.e. flat installed into the root of the site) then give the user an indication that this is a bad thing? I intend to work at it a bit, but given that I am quite the n00b when it comes to PHP, my version may release at some point when computers are all embedded.

Ciao,

Kurt

Yeah, more thorough checks for a secure install are certainly on my to-do list. I was initially thinking about adding them to the install script, but it seems they should really be embedded into Geeklog itself for all those auto installers.

The funny thing is that none of the authors of those auto installs ever contacted us. They just appeared out of nowhere. Initially, I thought they were a good idea but now I'm not so sure any more ...

If anyone can provide us with contact addresses, we'll try and have a word with them.

bye, Dirk

### Merging PHPBB and Geeklog

Authored by: [Macaco](https://www.geeklog.net/users.php?mode=profile&uid=12746) on Wednesday, July 19 2006 @ 10:59 am EDT

hello... how can I merge phpbb and geeklog using the same user accounts on both but without having to register on both separately?

I am running v1.4.0sr2. I decided to wait it out in May when sr3 was released with the statement... "Geeklog 1.4.1 available by the end of June." I admit it. I was lazy. Looks like I am 3 versions away now.
