  "CVE-2006-3404": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `xcf_load_vector()` function within the `app/xcf/xcf-load.c` file of GIMP. This vulnerability can be triggered when loading a specially crafted XCF file containing a large `num_axes` value. This can lead to a denial of service (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "media-gfx/gimp (versions < 2.2.12)",
      "gimp/2.2.6-1",
      "gimp/2.2.11-3",
      "gimp/2.3.9-1"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "media-gfx/gimp (versions >= 2.2.12)",
      "gimp/2.2.12-1",
       "2.3.10-1"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check when reading the `num_axes` value from an XCF file. The `xcf_load_vector()` function reads an integer `num_axes` and then attempts to read `num_axes` floats into a stack-allocated buffer with a fixed size of 6.  A large `num_axes` value leads to a buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to open a crafted XCF file. A crash/denial of service can occur if the attacker causes a simple stack corruption, while arbitrary code execution is achievable if the attacker carefully constructs the malicious XCF file to overwrite the return address on the stack.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted XCF file. The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to open such a malicious file with GIMP.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious XCF file with a large `num_axes` value. No other special capabilities or position is needed. The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious XCF file, which is considered user-complicit attack.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the VECTORS property of the XCF file. Viewers that do not parse this property are not affected. The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of GIMP, including stable, unstable, and development versions."
