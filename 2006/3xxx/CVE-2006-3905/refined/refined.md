```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The application is vulnerable to CRLF injection due to improper handling of cookie values.
    - The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the 'post_id' parameter of 'index.php' and in the search function.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - CRLF injection: Malicious data can be injected into HTTP headers via cookie values, potentially leading to various attacks.
    - SQL injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - CRLF injection could allow for HTTP response splitting, session hijacking, cache poisoning, and other attacks.
    - SQL injection can lead to data breaches, modification of application data, and in some cases, complete server compromise.

- Attack vectors:
    - CRLF injection: By injecting CRLF sequences into the cookie value.
    - SQL injection: By crafting malicious SQL code within the 'post_id' GET parameter or 'keyword' POST parameter.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with crafted cookie values or GET/POST parameters to the vulnerable web application.
