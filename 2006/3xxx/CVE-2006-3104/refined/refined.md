      "source": "securityreason.com_3edf76c5_20250124_161939.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Bitweaver handles uploaded files for articles. Specifically, the filename is not properly sanitized, and a temporary copy is created with a predictable name.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file upload handling",
        "Predictable temporary file names",
        "Lack of proper access control on temporary directories"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via crafted file upload.",
        "Direct access to the predictable temporary file path to execute code."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to upload files to the 'articles/edit.php' interface of the Bitweaver application. No specific authentication needed."
