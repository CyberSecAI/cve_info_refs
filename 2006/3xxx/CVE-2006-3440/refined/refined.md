  "CVE-2006-3440": {
    "description": "There is a remote code execution vulnerability in Winsock that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system. For an attack to be successful the attacker would have to force the user to open a file or visit a website that is specially crafted to call the affected Winsock API.",
    "root_cause": "An unchecked buffer in the Winsock API.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By persuading a user to open a specially crafted file.",
        "By persuading a user to view a specially crafted website.",
        "Possibly through previewing an e-mail message.",
        "Exploitation via an application using the affected API during normal usage scenarios."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted file or website that will trigger the vulnerability when accessed by the user.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists within the Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock) API, which enables network applications to transmit data across the wire, independent of the network protocol. This vulnerability is triggered by an unchecked buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when the affected API is called with malicious input."
