Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-3517:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** in the `stats.php` script of RW::Download. The script includes a file based on the `root_path` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsanitized user input:** The `stats.php` script does not properly sanitize or validate the `root_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The vulnerability is that an attacker can control the `root_path` parameter in `stats.php`, leading to the inclusion of a malicious remote file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable RW::Download application.
*   **Compromise of the web server:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the web server and any data it holds.
*   **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `stats.php` script with the malicious URL in the `root_path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server (remote).
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `stats.php` script, the `root_path` parameter, and how to craft the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable code is: `include_once $ROOT_PATH."functions/global_functions.php";` where $ROOT_PATH is attacker-controlled via the root_path parameter.
*   The exploit example provided is: `http://target/path/stats.php?root_path=code]` (where "code" would be the malicious URL).
*   The vulnerability was reported by StorMBoY of BsdMail.Org.
*   The CVSS base score is 7.5, with an exploitability subscore of 10.
