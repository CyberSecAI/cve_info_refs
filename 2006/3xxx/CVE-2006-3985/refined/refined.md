    {
      "source": "vuln.sg_dcf43a8b_20250124_224102.html",
      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the DZIPS32.DLL file, which is distributed with PowerArchiver.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability occurs when PowerArchiver attempts to add a file to a ZIP archive that contains a file with an overly long filename.",
        "The vulnerable function uses a fixed-size buffer (2048 bytes) to store the filename of a compressed file.",
		"If the filename exceeds this buffer size, a buffer overflow occurs.",
		"The function uses either `CharToOemA` or `lstrcpyA` to copy the filename into the buffer, both are vulnerable."
      ],
      "impact": "The buffer overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. It can also cause a crash.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted malicious ZIP archive containing an entry with an overly long filename.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious ZIP archive with PowerArchiver and then add a file to the archive."
