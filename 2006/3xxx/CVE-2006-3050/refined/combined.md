[MajorSecurity #17] SixCMS <= 6 - Multiple XSS and directory traversal vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------------
Software: SixCMS
Version: <=6
Type: Cross site scripting
Date: June, 12th 2006
Vendor: Six Offene Systeme GmbH
Page: http://www.sixcms.de
Credits:
----------------------------------------------
Discovered by: David "Aesthetico" Vieira-Kurz
http://www.majorsecurity.de
Original Advisory:
----------------------------------------------
http://www.majorsecurity.de/advisory/major\_rls17.txt
Affected Products:
----------------------------------------------
SixCMS 6 and prior
Description:
----------------------------------------------
SixCMS is a well known and commercial enterprise Content Management System.
Requirements:
----------------------------------------------
register\_globals = On
Vulnerability:
----------------------------------------------
Input passed to the "template" parameter in "detail.php" is not
properly verified, before it is used to execute the given arguments.
Acquiring access to known files outside of the web root and current directory
is possible through directory traversal techniques.
This is made possible through the use of "../../" in a HTTP request.
Input passes to the "page" parameter in "list.php" is not properly sanitised,
before it is used to execute the given arguments.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in context of an affected site.
Solution:
----------------------------------------------
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "strip\_tags()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed.
Example:
<?php
echo htmlspecialchars("<script");
?>
Set "register\_globals" to "Off".
Examples:
----------------------------------------------
/detail.php?template=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
/list.php?page=<script>alert("MajorSecurity")</script>
