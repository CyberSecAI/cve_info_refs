  "CVE-2006-3281": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Explorer because of the way that Windows Explorer handles Drag and Drop events. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow an attacker to save a file on the userâs system if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling by Windows Explorer of Drag and Drop events when a directory with a CLSID extension is encountered.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web page",
      "Malicious email message with a link or attachment"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page or email message that contains the malicious code, then convince a user to visit the malicious website or open the malicious email attachment.",
        "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by using a specially crafted directory with a CLSID extension.",
        "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability via drag and drop event.",
       "The vulnerability can be exploited via a malicious web page or email message.",
        "Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help mitigate attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.",
     "The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.",
     "The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment or click on a link that is sent in an e-mail message."
