  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Mambo Gallery Manager component (versions 0.95r2 and 0.95r3) is vulnerable to remote file inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion vulnerability exists in help.mgm.php, where the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `help.mgm.php` file, by specifying a malicious URL in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The target server must be running the vulnerable Mambo component."
