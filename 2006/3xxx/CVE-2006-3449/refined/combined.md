### General Information

## Executive Summary

This update resolves two newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft PowerPoint Mso.dll Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3590

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PowerPoint and could be exploited when a file containing a malformed shape container is parsed by PowerPoint. Such a file might be included in an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft PowerPoint Mso.dll Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3590

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. A user would have to click on an attachment and then acknowledge a warning and accept a prompt to **Open** before the vulnerability could be exploited.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**Note** PowerPoint 2000 files do not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft PowerPoint Mso.dll Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3590:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from un-trusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources.**

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK** to extract the .msp file:

   **[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate**

   **Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.
5. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
6. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
7. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:

   **msiexec /a** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/p C:\AdminUpdate\\*\**MSP File* **SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE**

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section for this workstation.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:

**msiexec /I** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/qb REINSTALL=\*\*Feature List **REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

http://www.nevisnetworks.com
http://secway.org/advisory/AD20060808.txt
Vendor
Microsoft Inc.
Microsoft PowerPoint 2000
Microsoft PowerPoint 2002
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003
PowerPoint 2004 for Mac
PowerPoint 2004 v. X for Mac
Remote: YES
Exploitable: maybe ;)
CVE: CVE-2006-3449
Overview:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the logged in user. An array boundary condition may be
violated by a malicious .PPT file in order to redirect execution into
attacker-supplied data. Exploitation requires that the attacker coerce or
persuade the victim to open a malicious .PPT file.
Details:
The specific flaw exists within the parsing of the BIFF(?) file format used
by Microsoft PowerPoint.
There will be a memory corruption during the analysis of a malformed PPT Record.
The disassembly code:
