    "content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2006-3360.\n\nThe vulnerability is a directory traversal in `index.php` of phpSysInfo, which allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files. This is achieved using a `..` sequence and a trailing null byte (`%00`) in the `lng` parameter. The application will display different error messages depending on whether a file exists or not, allowing for file existence checks.\n\nThe weakness is present in versions prior to 3.2.5 and is patched in 3.2.5. The attack vector is via HTTP GET parameter. An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web server to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can check the existence of arbitrary files on the server, potentially revealing sensitive system information and creating an avenue for further attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input (`lng` parameter) when constructing file paths, which leads to directory traversal.",
