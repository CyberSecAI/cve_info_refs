Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in `calendar.php` within Ltwcalendar version 4.1.3. The script directly includes files based on the `$ltw_config['include_dir']` variable which can be controlled by the attacker via the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI because it includes a file specified by user input through the `ltw_config[include_dir]` parameter.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `ltw_config[include_dir]` parameter before using it in the `require_once` statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code by providing a URL to a malicious PHP file on a server they control. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is the HTTP GET parameter `ltw_config[include_dir]` within the `calendar.php` script's URL. By modifying this parameter, an attacker can point to a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `calendar.php` script over the network.
*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious PHP script they wish to include.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is of low complexity, and doesn't require sophisticated exploitation skills to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a sample vulnerable URL: `http://www.victim.com/Ltwcalendar/calendar.php?ltw_config[include_dir]=Command-Shell`. This demonstrates how an attacker would specify the location of their malicious script to be included.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
