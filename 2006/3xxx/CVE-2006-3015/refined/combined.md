## WinSCP URI handlers fails to properly parse command line switches

#### Vulnerability Note VU#912588

Original Release Date: 2006-06-22 | Last Revised: 2006-07-07

---

### Overview

A vulnerability has been found in WinSCP, which can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite or add files to the victim's computer.

### Description

| [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) is an open source SFTP client for Microsoft windows. It supports a file-manager user interface, and uses the SSH protocol to transfer files between hosts. If an attacker convinces a user to follow a specially crafted URL, a file may be directly transferred to the user's computer. The attacker may also be able to append information to files.  Depending on what the user interface settings of WinSCP are, user-interaction may or may not be required to complete the file transfer. This vulnerability is a result of certain command line switches being passed to WinSCP in the malicious URL. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a victim user clicks on the specially-crafted URL, an attacker could send any chosen file to the victim's computer with access to folders that the user running WinSCP has write access to. The attacker could also append information to a file that may damage the file or make it unusable. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Version 3.8.2 of WinSCP has been [published](http://winscp.net/eng/docs/history#3.8.2) and contains a fix for this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version of the software. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Limit SSH client access to trusted servers. SSH servers usually listens on 22/tcp, but can be configured to listen on any TCP port.**Require User Interaction for File Transfers**WinSCP can be configured to notify the user of all file transfers and not automatically handle scp:// and sftp:// addresses. Users are encouraged to enable these [options](http://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_preferences). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
