  "CVE-2006-3585": {
    "Description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Jetbox CMS 2.1 SR1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) login parameter in admin/cms/index.php, (2) unspecified parameters in the \"Supply news\" page in formmail.php, (3) the URL in the \"Site statistics\" page, and the (5) query_string parameter when performing a search.",
    "Root cause": "Input passed via various parameters is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user or used in dynamic variable evaluations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "login parameter in admin/cms/index.php",
        "Unspecified parameters in the \"Supply news\" page in formmail.php",
        "URL parameters in the \"Site statistics\" page",
        "query_string parameter when performing a search"
    ],
