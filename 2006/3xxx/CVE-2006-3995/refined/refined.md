{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Mambo User Home Pages (UHP) module's `uhp_config.php` file directly includes another file using the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server. This can allow for data theft, defacement, and malware deployment.",
     "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a modified `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, an attacker can specify a remote file to be included and executed by the vulnerable script.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or access to the system is required to exploit the vulnerability."
