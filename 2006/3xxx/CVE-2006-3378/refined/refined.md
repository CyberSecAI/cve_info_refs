{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `passwd` utility, when called with the `-f`, `-g`, or `-s` options, did not properly check the result of the `setuid()` system call. This call is intended to drop privileges but may fail in certain PAM configurations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Missing error handling for the `setuid()` system call"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute `chfn`, `gpasswd`, or `chsh` with root privileges, potentially escalating their privileges on the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Execution of vulnerable `passwd` utility with specific options (`-f`, `-g`, or `-s`)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access on the system to execute the vulnerable command and a PAM configuration that can cause `setuid()` to fail when dropping privileges."
