{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be used within the browser environment. When Internet Explorer attempts to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX controls, these COM objects may corrupt system memory, leading to a condition where an attacker can execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper instantiation of COM objects in Internet Explorer.",
      "Memory corruption due to unintended COM object usage."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve complete control over the affected system. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted web page, which, when viewed by a user through Internet Explorer, attempts to instantiate vulnerable COM objects. This could be via visiting a compromised website or clicking on a malicious link in an email or instant message.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or distribute a link to a malicious page. Successful exploitation requires the user to visit the malicious site with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
