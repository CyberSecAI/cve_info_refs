```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a loop where a 16-bit unsigned short was used to iterate over a 32-bit unsigned value.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  The use of a smaller variable to iterate a larger value results in an infinite loop.

Impact of exploitation: The loop will never terminate causing a denial of service.

Attack vectors: A specially crafted TIFF file can trigger the infinite loop when processed by an application using the vulnerable library.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to a user or automated system that processes it using the vulnerable library.
