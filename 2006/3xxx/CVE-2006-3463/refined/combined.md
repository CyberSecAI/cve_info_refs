How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-3459 CVE-2006-3460 CVE-2006-3461 CVE-2006-3462
                 CVE-2006-3463 CVE-2006-3464 CVE-2006-3465

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several problems
in the TIFF library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:

CVE-2006-3459

    Several stack-buffer overflows have been discovered.

CVE-2006-3460

    A heap overflow vulnerability in the JPEG decoder may overrun a
    buffer with more data than expected.

CVE-2006-3461

    A heap overflow vulnerability in the PixarLog decoder may allow an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-3462

    A heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the NeXT RLE
    decoder.

CVE-2006-3463

    An loop was discovered where a 16bit unsigned short was used to
    iterate over a 32bit unsigned value so that the loop would never
    terminate and continue forever.

CVE-2006-3464

    Multiple unchecked arithmetic operations were uncovered, including
    a number of the range checking operations designed to ensure the
    offsets specified in TIFF directories are legitimate.

CVE-2006-3465

    A flaw was also uncovered in libtiffs custom tag support which may
    result in abnormal behaviour, crashes, or potentially arbitrary
    code execution.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.2-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.

sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

libtiff security update (RHSA-2006-0603)

Original Release Date: August 16, 2006

Last Revised: February 12, 2009

Number: ASA-2006-166

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Libtiff is a package of functions used to change and view TIFF
(Tagged Image File Format) files.

A number of vulnerabilities, including overflows, have been reported
in
libtiff. An attacker could create a malicious file that, if opened by a
user,
would crash the application used to open the file if that application
was linked
with libtiff on the local system, or potentially execute arbitrary code.
The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the
names
[CVE-2006-3459](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3459),
[CVE-2006-3460](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3460),
[CVE-2006-3461](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3461),
[CVE-2006-3462](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3462),
[CVE-2006-3463](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3463),
[CVE-2006-3464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3464), and
[CVE-2006-3465](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3465) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0603.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with libtiff installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1. |
| Avaya Message Networking | Prior to 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1. |

**Recommended Actions:**

For all system products which use vulnerable versions of libtiff, Avaya
recommends that customers restrict local and network access to the
server. This
restriction should be enforced through the use of physical security,
firewalls,
ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as
an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and
then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux)
or remove the affected packages.

# USN-330-1: tiff vulnerabilities

3 August 2006

tiff vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the TIFF library did not sufficiently

check handled images for validity. By tricking an user or an automated

system into processing a specially crafted TIFF image, an attacker

could exploit these weaknesses to execute arbitrary code with the

target application's privileges.

This library is used in many client and server applications, thus you

should reboot your computer after the upgrade to ensure that all

running programs use the new version of the library.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-07**

libTIFF contains several vulnerabilities that could result in arbitrary
code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.2-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.2-r2** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several heap and
stack buffer overflows and other flaws in libTIFF. The affected parts
include the TIFFFetchShortPair(), TIFFScanLineSize() and
EstimateStripByteCounts() functions, and the PixarLog and NeXT RLE
decoders.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file, resulting in the possible execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r2"
```

Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0044

Package names:	   apache, gnupg, libtiff
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-08-04
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  apache
  Apache is a full featured web server that is freely available, and also
  happens to be the most widely used. Built with loadable modules
  (all standard modules enabled). This verion is intended as a
  replacement for a standard apache, the configuration files provided
  with apache and apache-ssl are unchanged.

  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in compliance
  with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  libtiff
  The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating
  TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.  TIFF is a widely
  used file format for bitmapped images.  TIFF files usually end in the
  .tif extension and they are often quite large.

Problem description:
  apache < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in Apache HTTP Server,
    which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
    a vulnerable system. The vulnerability is caused by a off-by-one error
    in mod_rewrite within the ldap scheme handling and can be exploited
    to cause a one-byte buffer overflow.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-3747 to this issue.

  gnupg < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported a vulnerability in GnuPG,
    caused due to an input validation error in parse_packet.c when
    handling certain message packets. This can be exploited to cause
    GnuPG to consume large amounts of memory or crash via an overly
    long comment length in a message packet. This can further be
    exploited to cause an integer overflow, which leads to possible
    memory corruption and crashes GnuPG.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-3746 to this issue.

  libtiff < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team has reported some
    vulnerabilities in libTIFF, which can be exploited by malicious people
    to cause a DoS or potentially compromise a vulnerable system. The
    vulnerabilities are caused due to various heap and integer overflows
    when processing TIFF images and can be exploited via a specially
    crafted TIFF image.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-3459, CVE-2006-3460, CVE-2006-3461,
    CVE-2006-3462, CVE-2006-3463, CVE-2006-3464 and CVE-2006-3465
    these issues.

Action:
  We recommend that all systems with this package installed be upgraded.
  Please note that if you do not need the functionality provided by this
  package, you may want to remove it from your system.
