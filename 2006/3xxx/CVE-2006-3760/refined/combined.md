MyBB 1.1.5 Released

| **[Chris Boulton](https://community.mybb.com/user-1.html)**  Offline   [Founder](https://mybb.com/about/team/#role-founder)    Posts: 5,042 Threads: 309 Joined: Jun 2004  Reputation:  [**88**](reputation.php?uid=1)      **[#1](thread-10115-post-64107.html#pid64107 "MyBB 1.1.5 Released")**   2006-06-27, 03:46 PM   And in the continuation of something which couldn't have come at a worse time, we're releasing MyBB 1.1.5 - a security update to the MyBB 1.x series. It fixes a few potentially high risk vulnerabilities affecting MyBB 1.0 PR 2 to MyBB 1.1.4.  As an ever growing list of vulnerabilities appears to be found in MyBB, we've performed a software based code audit on the package which detects potential SQL injections, cross site scripting and general security issues. It made us aware of several issues in 1.1.4 so we're immediately releasing a patch. From now on, each release of MyBB will be audited using this application before it is downloadable.  The release also fixes a few other vulnerabilities discovered by third parties.  We recommend all users upgrade their copy of MyBB to the latest available release.  * Potential cross site scripting with [http:// tag - also affects MyBB 1.0 RC2 ...b Security](http://%20tag%20-%20also%20affects%20MyBB%201.0%20RC2%20and%20greater%20(%5Burl=http://myimei.com/security%5Dimei%20Web%20Security)) * Potential SQL injection in "Archive mode" on servers with register\_globals enabled ([imei Web Security](http://myimei.com/security)) * Potential user group manipulation (makpaolo) * Other potential SQL injection attacks (Internal code audit, confirmed by DCoder)   The release on the MyBB site has also been updated to 1.1.5.  Update instructions are in the next post, including a list of changed files (and a ZIP archive of them) as well as manual patching instructions for those of you who have customized their code.  There is the potential once again for scripts to be written to exploit these vulnerabilities. Please ensure you update your board as soon as you can and that you inform anyone you know running MyBB to do the same.  If your board is compromised, please send myself or one of the other team members as much information you can (including raw access logs) and we'll try to do our best to resolve the situation. If you also need assistance in upgrading, please do not hesitate to contact me about it and I'll get you up to date.  It does truly sadden me to see this happen to our product - people's installations being compromised by "script kiddy" and hacking groups where destroying other peoples property is considered fun. Hopefully things will calm down - and I am sorry, personally, for once again having to release another patch for MyBB.

There was a bug found in the update released today: The full package, changed files, and patch file all contain a line which will create a fatal error with PHP as follows: Quote:Fatal error: Call to undefined method databaseEngine::simple\_select() in /path/to/mybb/usercp.php on line 1744  To fix this: Open usercp.php Find: ``` 		$query = $db->simple_select(TABLE_PREFIX."usergroups", "*", "gid='".intval($mybb->input['joingroup'])."'"); ``` Replace with: ``` 		$query = $db->query("SELECT * FROM ".TABLE_PREFIX."usergroups WHERE gid='".intval($mybb->input['joingroup'])."'"); ```  This is a bug affects users joining secondary usergroups via the User CP.  Just a little bit of 1.2 code slipped in.

The full package will be fixed as soon as possible.  Anyone who updated to 1.1.5 before this post should take note of the instructions posted by Dennis above.

Problems with editpost.php  If you have downloaded the full MyBB 1.1.5 package, there was some extra text that accidentally made its way into the editpost.php file that should not have been there.  At the beginning of editpost.php, find: ``` yea<?php ``` Replace with: ``` <?php ```  To repeat, this only affects boards that have used the full MyBB 1.1.5 package downloaded from the site.  Again, we are sorry for the inconvenience that this may have caused you.  The full package will be fixed as soon as possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
