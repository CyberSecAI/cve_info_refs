The provided content relates to CVE-2006-3760.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MyBB 1.1.5 release was a security update addressing multiple vulnerabilities found in previous versions (1.0 PR 2 to 1.1.4). The vulnerabilities were discovered via both internal code audit and third-party submissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A potential XSS vulnerability existed with the handling of `[http://` tags. This vulnerability also affected MyBB 1.0 RC2 and later versions.
2.  **Potential SQL Injection in "Archive mode":** A potential SQL injection vulnerability existed in the "Archive mode" on servers with `register_globals` enabled.
3.  **Potential User Group Manipulation:** There was a potential vulnerability allowing manipulation of user groups.
4.  **Other potential SQL injection attacks:** Internal code audit revealed other potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection attacks could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete database data, potentially leading to complete compromise of the forum and user data.
*   **User Group Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially grant themselves administrative rights or manipulate user groups, leading to unauthorized access and control of the forum.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Exploiting the vulnerable `[http://` tag handling.
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious input in "Archive mode", specifically on servers with `register_globals` enabled.
*   **User Group Manipulation:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in the user group management code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious tags into user-generated content on the forum.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker would need to interact with the "Archive mode" of the forum on a server where register\_globals was enabled and supply malicious input.
*   **User Group Manipulation:** The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerabilities in user group code.

The provided content also details a bug in the initial release of the update, which would cause a fatal error when users tried to join secondary usergroups. This was not a vulnerability but a software bug that was quickly addressed with a fix posted in the forum and later with a corrected full package. Another bug that caused extra text to appear in `editpost.php` was also addressed.
