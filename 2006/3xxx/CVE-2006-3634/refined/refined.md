{
  "CVE-2006-3634": {
    "Description": "The (1) __futex_atomic_op and (2) futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic functions in Linux kernel 2.6.17-rc4 to 2.6.18-rc2 perform the atomic futex operation in the kernel address space instead of the user address space, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash).",
    "Root cause": "The futex operations are performed in the kernel address space instead of the user address space.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect futex implementation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service (crash).",
    "Attack vector": "Local access.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "Local user access."
