{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Keyif Portal v2.0 application stores Microsoft Access database files (MDB) in publicly accessible web directories.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Insecure Storage of Database Files"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can directly download the MDB files, potentially gaining access to sensitive information contained within the databases. This could include user data, configurations, or other critical application data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct web request to the MDB file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to know or guess the path to the MDB files, but does not require any authentication or special privileges to download them."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content gives specific examples of vulnerable paths where these MDB files are stored, including 'ANKET/anket.mdb', 'HABER/keyifweb.mdb', 'ASP/download.mdb', and 'SAYAC/aktif.mdb', under a common directory 'database/A9S7G6ASD790/'. The vulnerability is further explained by providing code snippets that show how the application uses the Microsoft Access Driver to connect to these databases."
