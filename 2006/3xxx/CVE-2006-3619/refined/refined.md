{
  "CVE-2006-3619": {
    "description": "A directory traversal flaw was discovered in fastjar. An attacker could create a malicious JAR file which, if unpacked using fastjar, could write to any files the victim had write access to.",
    "root_cause": "The `fastjar` utility did not properly validate file paths within a JAR archive, allowing directory traversal.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system that the user running `fastjar` has write access to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious JAR file with filenames containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious JAR file. The user must then use the vulnerable `fastjar` utility to extract the archive.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present because `fastjar` doesn't properly check for `..` sequences in file paths inside the archive before extracting files, allowing an attacker to write to arbitrary locations that the user has permission to write to. The issue is also described in relation to the libgcj library."
