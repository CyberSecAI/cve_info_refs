    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Safe Mode Bypass",
      "open_basedir bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass safe mode restrictions and write to arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution by writing malicious PHP scripts.",

        "Local access using the php cli"
