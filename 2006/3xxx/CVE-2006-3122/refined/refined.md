  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An edge condition in the `supersede_lease` function within `memory.c` of ISC DHCP server version 2.0pl5. The function incorrectly interprets a 32-byte client-identifier in a DHCPDISCOVER packet as a corrupt uid.",

      "Improper input validation",

    "description": "The `supersede_lease` function in `memory.c` in ISC DHCP (dhcpd) server 2.0pl5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32 byte client-identifier, which causes the packet to be interpreted as a corrupt uid and causes the server to exit with 'corrupt lease uid.'"
