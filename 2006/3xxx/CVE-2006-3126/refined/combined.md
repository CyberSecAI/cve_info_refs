How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CAPI4Hylafax fax receiver: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200610-05**

CAPI4Hylafax allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/capi4hylafax** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **01.03.00.99.300.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **01.03.00.99.300.3-r1** |

### Background

CAPI4Hylafax makes it possible to send and receive faxes via CAPI and
AVM Fritz!Cards.

### Description

Lionel Elie Mamane discovered an error in c2faxrecv, which doesn't
properly sanitize TSI strings when handling incoming calls.

### Impact

A remote attacker can send null (\0) and shell metacharacters in the
TSI string from an anonymous fax number, leading to the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running c2faxrecv.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CAPI4Hylafax users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/capi4hylafax-01.03.00.99.300.3-r1"
```

Subject: capi4hylafax: c2faxrecv problem with anonymous incoming calls
Date: Fri, 11 Aug 2006 11:51:50 +0200
```
package: capi4hylafax
version: 01.02.03-10

i have a problem with c2faxrecv and as result with faxrecv and faxdispatch:

when an incoming fax-call provides the cidnumber, everything is fine -
the fax is converted to pdf and will be delivered via email.
but when the incoming call is "anonymous" (without cidnumber) it seems
that faxdispatch a) isn't called or b) cant handle the empty string for
cidnumber.

session logs following

incoming call provides senders number (msn)

c2faxrecv - INFO: Fax received and calling
'/var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd "recvq/fax00003.tif" "faxCAPI" "0000
0003" "" "+49 30 1234567" "" "9876543"'.

incoming call does not provide senders number

c2faxrecv - INFO: Fax received and calling
'/var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd "recvq/fax00007.tif" "faxCAPI" "0000
0007" "" "+49'.

the parameter cidnumber is truncated after the country-id (49 for
germany) when incoming call is "anonymous".
when i start faxrcvd manually from shell with

/var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd "recvq/fax00007.tif" "faxCAPI" "00000007"
"" "+49" (note the change of cidnumber here)

it works fine and faxdispatch is called too.

so i think, that c2faxrecv can't handle anonymous incoming calls (where
the sending station isn't providing any information or number). the
parameter cidnumber is truncated after the country code and the
parameters cidname and destination are missing completely.

i am using sarge and dont have any unstable mirrors in my sources.list

regards,
arne

"00000048" "" "" "" "yyy"'.

so:
normal calls with clip and "normal calls" with clir are handled correctly.
ony fax via web.de is not delivered because of the destroyed parameters.

any hints? more info needed? what must i do to provide more detailled info?

I don't know the program "faxdispatch". It is not part of capi4hylafax
and seems not be in any other Debian package. What is it?

Please try with a newer version of capi4hylafax. You can recompile it
to get it working on sarge, if you know how to do that. Alternatively,
please have a fax that is not working for you sent to me, on +31 24
360 67 12 (and email me to warn me it has been done, so that I go
looking at my logs).

P.S.: Please do not make your emails with priority "highest" or
      "high". Such emails automatically land in my spam folder, and
      thus delay my seeing them by up to a few months. I saw this
      email only after I went fishing for it after getting your
      second.

faxdispatch is part oh hylafax-server. it's a small file where SENDTO
can be set according to several conditions, e.g. send fax to
sam@localhost if Destination is 12345, all other fax go to mario@localhost.
faxdispatch is called from faxrecvd.

but the whole mechanism wont work when the parameters are truncated like
in my example via web.de(2nd mail):

then faxrecvd wont send *any* email, no notification to faxmaster, no
pdf to selected users (that is setup in faxdispatch).

hm.
i have capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.297.orig.tar.gz but only
libcapi20-dev(1:3.6.2005-01-03) and libtiff4-dev (1:3.7.2-7)
i did ./configure && make && ./install
c2faxrecv was copied to /usr/local/bin, i edited that in
/etc/init.d/capi4hylafax. after restarting capi4hylafax, c2faxrecv was
running but not able to handle incomming calls.

and i cant sent a fax to your number, because i can only sent fax to
destinations in germany.

dont know what to do now...

Please get

 capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.297.orig.tar.gz
 capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.297-3.diff.gz
 capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.297-3.dsc

from the pool/main/c/capi4hylafax directory of any Debian
mirror. Install packages build-essential and devscripts. Then do
(replacing $EDITOR with your favourite editor):

 dpkg-source -x capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.297-3.diff.gz
 cd capi4hylafax-01.03.00.99.svn.297
 $EDITOR debian/control
 # In the line that begins with Build-Depends, remove the parts
 # between parentheses.

ok, that worked perfectly - thank you for that information.
i now have capi4hylafax-01.03.00.99.snv.297 installed on my Sarge-System.

Incoming calls with CIDNumber and "normal" calls without CIDNumber
(anonymous) are handled like they should be.
Now i wait for someone to help me with those faxes, that subscribers can
send using their web.de or 1und1.de accounts. They send a CIDNumber that
results in truncated parameter strings.

I hope i will be back soon with more information.

the call on 08/14/06 15:48 was made using web.de
in the original file wordpad show me some special characters in
CIDNumber field.

i can't even copy that file into this mail (using win xp at work).
so i attached the file.

ps: the call on 08/16/06 09:35 was made using my just installed
capi4hylafax-01.03.00.99.svn.297 :)
it was a "normal" anonymous call, note the change in the
CIDNumber-field, the call on 08/15/06 12:54 was received using the
stable version 01.02.03-10

hi lionel!

did you already had some time to think about the problem?
di you have a clue what would cause this behavior when receiving fax
with "special" CIDNumber?

I see. I've put a new version at
<http://people.debian.org/~lmamane/capi4hylafax/> . Please try it out
(follow the same procedure as with the version you got from sid:
unpack, edit debian/control, build .debs, install, test if bug is
still there).

Description:
 capi4hylafax - Faxing over CAPI 2.0 device
Closes: [382474](bugreport.cgi?bug=382474)
Changes:
 capi4hylafax (1:01.03.00.99.svn.300-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream release:
     - Fix for #358567 taken upstream
     - Fix for long (> 200 chars) lines in config files
     - Higher debbugging level
   * Bumped up Standards-Version
 .
 capi4hylafax (1:01.03.00.99.svn.297-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=high
 .
   * Don't let null characters from cidnumber prematurely terminate C
     string preparing command line for faxrcvd in c2faxrecv
     (closes: #[382474](bugreport.cgi?bug=382474)).
     Also remove shell metacharacters while I'm at it. This probably fixes
     a security vulnerability (arbitrary remote command execution under
     uucp identity): the said command line contains untrusted
     sender-controlled data, the sender's identification (the TSI
     string). (The ITU T.30 specification restricts this string to a prefix
     '+' and digits only, but rumour has it an attacker can transmit
     arbitrary ASCII data, including null characters.)

OK, package has been built and installed. nothing special so far and
working good.

Then i have to kill the c2faxrecv-process manually, because it wont

this happens on all incoming calls - with CIDNumber and without.

Hmmm... That was a brown paper bag bug. I've put a new version at the
same place; this was prepared during the day instead of during the
night, so it should be better quality. (It works for me at least, this
time I've tested it.)

ok, fax with CIDNumber and without CIDNumber (and no null characters in
it) are processed correctly.

no entry in xferfaxlog
have to kill and restart c2faxrecv again after that.

would you be so kind to look, if there is still a bug in your
null-character-detection?

I have found one bug, but as I cannot test myself, I cannot be sure it
is the cause of the crash/freeze. I've put a new version at the same
place. Please test. (And sorry for the bug, but coding without being
able to test the result is really hard...)

IT WORKS! :)

Lionel, thank you very much!
I tested the "previous" version, modified on 25-Aug-2006.

This works perfectly. Now it says "Sender: +49"

xferfaxlog still contains those null characters, but capi4hylafax-log says
c2faxrecv - INFO: Fax received and calling
'/var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd "recvq/fax000000015.tif" "faxCAPI"
"000000059" "" "+49?????????????????" "" "xxx"'.
(xxx is my MSN used for faxCAPI).

So faxrecvd is called with the right number of parameters (and all
parameters, none is missing) and faxdispatch can set SENDTO correctly
depending on my MSN now.

Fantastic work!
For me this version is ready for etch and sarge.

BTW: what are the "really minor" changes you made in the 26-Aug-version?

Hello,

I had the exact same problem and therefore I backported the
capi4hylafax_01.03.00.99.svn.300-3 package to my sarge today.

Thanks Lionel for the great work !!

Now, it seems everything works as expected, but I get lots of this
messages in capi4hylafax log:

Discrepance between CAPI's (0) and internal (1) number of pages!

and those fax calls get dropped afterwards.

Any idea what this could be ? Any side effect of this bugfix ?

thanks

Moritz

The security update DSA-1165 also fixes this bug; see
<http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1165> .

You did not get these before? Have you determined with what type of
faxes you get this error message and which one you don't? What
hardware do you use, is it with the latest firmware/drivers?

> Any side effect of this bugfix ?

I don't think so. It may be an effect of other changes between the
sarge version and 01.03.00.99.svn.300-3; please try with
01.02.03-10sarge2.

Well, actually I wasn't using the Sarge package before.
I already had other problems with that one so I was already  using a
backported capi4hylafax_01.03.00-2 Version which as I said had no big
Problems beside the one with faxrecvd script call discussed here.

I never got those "Discrepance" Errors before though. It only started
to appear after upgrading from  01.03.00-2 to 01.03.00.99.svn.300-3 ??

Now I checked and found out it seems to happen only when the call is
speech instead of fax.
When I call the Faxmachine from my mobil, I will hear the Faxtones
from the Server and then the error will occur exactly when hanging up
on my mobil.

So I think it does not realy affect productivity as it seems. Its just
little annoying because it always will dump the error to STDERR and
syslog

I am still using 01.03.00.99.svn.300-3, version 25 Aug 2006, and never
excpected such errors in capi4hylafaxlog or syslog. Not with 3.1kHz
audio or speech calls.
Everything works fine here.

BTW: Lionel, what's about version 01.02.03-10sarge2 ? Is bug# 382474
fixed in this version? I mean, if so, i can "downgrade" to this stable
version.

Regards,
Arne

Yes. The change between 1:01.02.03-10 and 1:01.02.03-10sarge2 is only
the fix of #382474.

Yes, you can.
