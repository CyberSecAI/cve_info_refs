# Tor: Several vulnerabilities — GLSA **200606-04**

Tor is vulnerable to a possible buffer overflow, a Denial of Service,
information disclosure and information leak.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/tor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.1.1.20** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.1.1.20**revision >= **0.1.0.18** |

### Background

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

### Description

Some integer overflows exist when adding elements to the smartlists.
Non-printable characters received from the network are not properly
sanitised before being logged. There are additional unspecified bugs in
the directory server and in the internal circuits.

### Impact

The possible buffer overflow may allow a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the server by sending large inputs. The other
vulnerabilities can lead to a Denial of Service, a lack of logged
information, or some information disclosure.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-misc/tor
```
