- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflows when adding elements to smartlists, unsanitized non-printable characters from the network, and unspecified bugs in the directory server and internal circuits.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow, Denial of Service, information disclosure, and information leak.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending large inputs (buffer overflow), Denial of Service, lack of logged information, or information disclosure.
- Attack vectors: Sending large inputs over the network, unspecified vectors related to directory server and internal circuits.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Remote attacker capable of sending crafted network traffic to the Tor server.
