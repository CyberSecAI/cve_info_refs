  "CVE-2006-3812": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in the way Mozilla products (specifically SeaMonkey, Firefox and Thunderbird) handle 'chrome:' URLs. These URLs, which are meant to access privileged browser interface components, can be manipulated to reference remote files. If a remote file contains a script, it will execute with chrome privileges.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox",
      "SeaMonkey",
      "Thunderbird",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 4",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 4",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop 4",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux for IBM z Systems 4",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Power, big endian 4"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of 'chrome:' URLs allows them to reference remote files. When these remote files contain scripts, they execute with elevated (chrome) privileges.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Use of hard-coded or insecure URLs",
        "Lack of sufficient checks on URLs before loading"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user who opened the affected browser or email application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "By tricking the user into manually entering the malicious chrome URL into the address bar.",
        "By convincing a user to copy/drag an untrusted link that does not begin with http://, https://, or ftp:// to the browser's address bar"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the victim to manually interact with a specially crafted chrome URL, or to copy/drag it to the address bar. The attacker must be able to host the malicious script and make it accessible via the network.  A malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could also be leveraged to execute arbitrary javascript instructions with chrome permissions."
