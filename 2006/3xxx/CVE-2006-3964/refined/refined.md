The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Banex 2.21, including sensitive information disclosure, SQL injection, and remote file inclusion.

**1. Sensitive Information Disclosure**
   - **Root cause:** The file `inc/lib.inc` containing database credentials (database name, username, password) is directly accessible without any protection.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of access control on sensitive configuration files.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker can directly access the database credentials.
   - **Attack Vectors:**  Directly accessing the `/inc/lib.inc` file through a web browser.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.

**2. SQL Injection (Admin Panel)**
   - **Root cause:**  Insecure handling of user-supplied input in the admin panel. Specifically,  the HTTP Authorization header is used to perform SQL queries without sanitization.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
   - **Attack Vectors:**  Sending a crafted HTTP request to `admin.php` with a malicious Basic Authentication header.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.

**3. SQL Injection (Signup)**
    - **Root cause:**  Insecure handling of user-supplied input in the signup functionality. The `site_name` parameter is vulnerable.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
    - **Impact:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Sending a crafted HTTP request to `signup.php` with a malicious `site_name` parameter.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.

**4. SQL Injection (Multiple Admin Panel Pages)**
   - **Root cause:** Insecure handling of parameters in multiple admin panel pages. This vulnerability exists even when magic quotes are enabled.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries in SELECT and DELETE context.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests to various admin.php endpoints with malicious `id` or `deleteuserbanner` parameters. The following endpoints are listed as vulnerable:
        - `/admin.php?activatebanner&id=-1 [SQLi]`
        - `/admin.php?activateuser&id='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?deleteunuser&id='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?deleteuserbanner&deleteuserbanner='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?viewmem&viewmem='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?viewmemunb&viewmemunb='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?viewunmem&viewunmem='+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?deletebanner&id=-1+[SQL]`
        - `/admin.php?activateuser&deleteuser='+[SQL]`
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.

**5. Remote File Inclusion**
    - **Root cause:** The `cfg_root` parameter in `members.php` is vulnerable to remote file inclusion.
    - **Weaknesses:** Insecure use of the `cfg_root` parameter to include files.
   - **Impact:**  An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `members.php` with a malicious `cfg_root` parameter.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
