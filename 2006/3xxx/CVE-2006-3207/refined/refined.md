{
  "CVE-2006-3207": {
    "root_cause": "Directory traversal vulnerability and insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal vulnerability",
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Use of dynamically evaluated variables"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to code execution after modifying the file permissions. This is achieved by injecting a Perl CGI script which is made executable via chmod. An attacker could compromise the server or gain access to sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted 'id' parameter with directory traversal sequences (../) and a null byte (%00) via HTTP POST or cookie",
	  "Crafting the 'message' parameter with the malicious script and using '[NR]' sequences",
      "Calling close.php with modified 'id' and 't_id' to alter the permissions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send HTTP requests to the server to exploit the vulnerability."
  }
