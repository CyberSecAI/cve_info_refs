|  |  | **Security Advisory : CT12-09-2006**  Adobe/Macromedia Flash Player - Remote Code Execution   | **Severity:** | **Critical** | | --- | --- | | **Impact:** | **Remote System Access** | | **Solution Status:** | **Vendor Patch** | | **CVE Reference:** | **[CVE-2006-3311](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2006-3311)** | | **Advisory Date:** | **12th September 2006** | |  |  | | **Affected Software:** | **Adobe Flash Player 8.0.24.0 and earlier versions Adobe Flash Professional 8, Flash Basic Adobe Flash MX 2004 Adobe Flex 1.5** |   **1. OVERVIEW  Adobe/Macromedia Flash Player is the world's most ubiquitous Browser plug-in  for Microsoft, Mozilla and Apple technologies. The plug-in claims to facilitate  high-impact web interfaces and interactive online advertising for circa 98% of  desktops globally.  Unfortunately, it transpires that Adobe Flash Player is prone to a remote  arbitrary code execution vulnerability, that allows an attacker to gain control of a target system through the simple invocation of a maliciously  constructed web page.**  **2. TECHNICAL NARRATIVE  The vulnerability originates out of Flash's failure to sufficiently handle large dynamically generated strings at run time. As a result, it is possible  (using rudimentary Action Script) to create a .swf movie in such a way that  when processed by the Plug-in, will overwrite system memory at an explicit location.  More specifically, the aforementioned location can (with a certain degree of  accuracy) be attacker controlled via the direct manipulation of the overall  length of the generated string.  The net result is that of a partially controllable condition, which opens the  door to a multitude of differing exploitation vectors, including but not  limited to heap/stack overwrites, and/or 3rd party race conditions.**  **3. EXPLOITATION  Computer Terrorism (UK) can confirm the un-disclosed production of a reliable multi-platform & multi-browser Web based Proof-Of-Concept (PoC). Such an  exploit could be used in a web-based attack scenario, where unsuspecting  users are lured to a maliciously constructed website.**  **4. VENDOR RESPONSE  The vendor security bulletin and corresponding patches are available at the  following location:  <http://www.adobe.com/go/apsb06-11/>**  **5. DISCLOSURE ANALYSIS   12/05/2006 - Preliminary Vendor notification. 18/05/2006 - Vulnerability confirmed in pre-release Flash 9, and earlier versions 28/06/2006 - Flash Player 9 released (Fixed) 31/07/2006 - Public Disclosure deferred by Vendor. 12/09/2006 - Coordinated public release.  Total Time to Fix: 4 months (123 days)**  **6.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Adobe Flash Player EOL General Information

**UPDATED:** January 13, 2021

Since Adobe no longer supports Flash Player after December 31, 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021, Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems.

Some users may continue to see reminders from Adobe to uninstall Flash Player from their system. See below for more details on how to uninstall Flash Player.

### When is the Flash Player End-of-Life (EOL)?

Adobe stopped supporting Flash Player beginning December 31, 2020 (“EOL Date”), as [previously announced](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/adobe-flash-update) in July 2017.

### Why did Adobe decide to EOL Flash Player and select the end of 2020 date?

Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content. Also, major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Flash Player). See Flash Player EOL announcements from [Apple](https://webkit.org/blog/7839/adobe-announces-flash-distribution-and-updates-to-end#_blank), [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2017/07/25/Games-Migration-to-Open-Web-Standards#_blank), [Google](https://blog.google/products/chrome/saying-goodbye-flash-chrome#_blank), [Microsoft](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/07/25/flash-on-windows-timeline#_blank) and [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2017/07/25/firefox-roadmap-flash-end-life#_blank).

By providing more than three years’ advance notice, Adobe believes that there has been sufficient time for developers, designers, businesses, and other parties to migrate Flash content to new standards. The EOL timing was in coordination with some of the major browser vendors.

### What does Flash Player EOL mean?

After the EOL Date, Adobe will not issue Flash Player updates or security patches. Adobe strongly recommends immediately uninstalling Flash Player. To help secure your system, Adobe blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021. Major browser vendors have disabled and will continue to disable Flash Player from running.

### Why should I uninstall Flash Player from my system?

Flash Player may remain on your system unless you uninstall it. Uninstalling Flash Player will help secure your system since Adobe will not issue Flash Player updates or security patches after the EOL Date. Adobe blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021 and the major browser vendors have disabled and will continue to disable Flash Player from running after the EOL Date.

### How do I uninstall Adobe Flash Player?

Click “Uninstall” when prompted by Adobe, or follow these manual uninstall instructions for [Windows](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/support-options-free-discontinued-apps-services.html) and [Mac](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/programs/support-options-free-discontinued-apps-services.html) users.

### Why is Adobe blocking Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021?

Since Adobe is no longer supporting Flash Player after the EOL Date, Adobe blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021 to help secure your system. Flash Player may remain on your system unless you uninstall it.

### Which browsers and operating systems currently support Adobe Flash Player?

Browsers and operating systems that support Flash Player continue to decrease so Adobe strongly recommends immediately uninstalling Flash Player.

Apple Safari version 14, released for macOS in September 2020, no longer loads Flash Player or runs Flash content. Please visit [Apple’s Safari support](https://support.apple.com/safari#_blank) for more information.

Please visit <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/tech-specs.html> for the latest list of Flash-supported browsers and operating systems.

### Will Adobe make previous versions of Adobe Flash Player available for download after 2020?

No. Adobe has removed Flash Player download pages from its site. Adobe blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021.

### If I find Flash Player available for download on a third-party website, should I use it?

You should not use unauthorized versions of Flash Player. Unauthorized downloads are a common source of malware and viruses.

### Will Adobe provide security updates for Flash Player after the EOL date?

Adobe will not issue Flash Player updates or security patches after the EOL Date. Adobe strongly recommends uninstalling Flash Player immediately.

### Overview

Adobe Flash Player fails to properly handle malformed strings. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| [Adobe Flash Player](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/) is a player for the Flash media format and enables frame-based animations with sound to be viewed within a web browser. Adobe Flash Player fails to properly handle long dynamic strings, which allows a buffer overflow to occur. The specific cause of the underlying defect or the malformed strings that could exploit this vulnerability is not known.  Note that Microsoft has released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-069](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-069.mspx) to address this issue. |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Flash Player**Adobe has addressed this issue in [Adobe Flash Player 9.0.16.0](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/).**Apply updates**Users who are unable to upgrade to Adobe Flash Player 9.0.16.0 should apply the appropriate player update listed in Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB06-11](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb06-11.html). Users running operating systems that do not support Adobe Flash Player 8 should refer to the updates in Adobe's [Flash Player TechNote](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=d9c2fe33). Microsoft has addressed this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-069](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-069.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Microsoft has suggested the following workarounds.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

**Executive Summary:**

This update resolves privately reported vulnerabilities in Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe, version 6.0.84.0 and earlier. Macromedia Flash Player is a third party software application that also was redistributed with Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 3, and Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. Each vulnerability is documented in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin. The [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11](https://www.adobe.com/go/apsb06-11/), issued September 12, 2006, describes the vulnerabilities and provides the download locations for customers who have installed Flash Player 7 and higher so that you can install the appropriate update based on the version of Flash Player you are using. Customers that have followed the guidance in the [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://www.adobe.com/go/apsb06-11/) are not at risk from these vulnerabilities.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this Bulletin revised on May 13, 2008?**

This bulletin was revised to add Windows XP Service Pack 3 as affected software. This is a detection update only. There were no changes to the binaries, since the same update for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition applies to Windows XP Service Pack 3. Customers with Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition who have already installed the security update will not need to reinstall the update. Customers with Windows XP Service Pack 3 should apply the update immediately.

**Is Flash Player a Microsoft technology?**

No. This software is made by Adobe Systems Inc., formerly Macromedia, Inc.

**Is MacromediaFlash Player redistributed by Microsoft?**

Yes. Some versions of Flash Player have been redistributed by Microsoft. The supported versions of Windows that redistribute Flash Player are Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Service Pack 3, and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. No other supported versions of Windows redistribute Flash Player. Other software applications from Microsoft may also redistribute Macromedia Flash Player.

**Note** that if you use the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer on Windows XP Professional x64 Edition you do not have MacromediaFlash Player available to you. The Macromedia Flash Player included with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is the 32-bit version.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin ID and affected operating systems are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Windows 2000 | Windows XP (all versions) | Windows Server 2003 (all versions) |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Product | MBSA 1.2.1 | Enterprise Scanning Tool (EST) | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 | No | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition | No | No | Yes |

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of EST that is being released this month, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the following FAQ, âCan I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Product | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 | Yes (With EST) | Yes |
| Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition | No | Yes |

SMS 2.0 and SMS 2003 Software Update Services (SUS) Feature Pack can use MBSA 1.2.1 for detection and therefore have the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA 1.2.1 does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT), can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about SUIT, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154/).

**Can I use SMS to determine if the Macromedia Flash Player is installed on a system?**

Yes. SMS can help detect if the Macromedia Flash Player is installed on a system. SMS can search for the existence of the file Flash.ocx. Flash.ocx version 6.0.84.0 or earlier may be vulnerable. This security update installs Flash6.ocx version 6.0.88.0 and removes the version of Flash.ocx it is replacing.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:

Several remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe because of the way that it handles Flash Animation (SWF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by constructing a specially crafted Flash Animation (SWF) file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file. The specially crafted SWF file could also be sent as an e-mail attachment. A user would only be at risk if opening this e-mail attachment. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:

* Customers that have followed the guidance in [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11](https://www.adobe.com/go/apsb06-11) are not at risk from the vulnerabilities.
* By default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 do not ship with Flash Player installed. However, customers that have installed a version of Macromedia Flash Player on these versions of Windows are encouraged to follow the guidance in the [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB06-11](https://www.adobe.com/go/apsb06-11).
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit these vulnerabilities by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario described previously.
  By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the [Outlook E-mail Security Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334) has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS04-018](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527) has been installed.

#### Workarounds for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Temporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer for Windows XP Service Pack 2**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. On Windows XP Service Pack 2 use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to disable the ActiveX control.

  1. Start Internet Explorer.
  2. On the **Tools** menu, click **Manage Add-ons.**
  3. Locate and click on âShockwave Flash Objectâ.
  4. To disable the add-on, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you cannot locate the ActiveX control then use the drop-down box to switch from âAdd-ons currently being used in Internet Explorerâ to âAdd-ons that have been used by Internet Explorerâ and follow steps 3 and 4. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list you either have not used the ActiveX control before or it is not present on your system. See the workaround âTemporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorerâ for additional information.

  For more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/883256).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  To regain functionality you need to use the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature to enable the ActiveX control.
* **Temporarily prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  Temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{1171A62F-05D2-11D1-83FC-00A0C9089C5A}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D27CDB70-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Flash Player ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  To regain functionality you need to undo the kill bits for the Flash Player ActiveX control remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Flash Player ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
* **Modify the Access Control List on the Flash Player ActiveX control to temporarily prevent it from running in Internet Explorer**

  To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on the Flash Player ActiveX control to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**cmd**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Type the following commands at a command prompt. Make a note of the current files ACLs, including inheritance settings. You may need this list if you have to undo these modifications:

     **cacls %windir%\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx**
  3. Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the âeveryoneâ group access to this file:

     **echo y|cacls %windir%\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx /d everyone**
  4. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  To regain functionality you need to undo the modifications to the Access Control List on the ActiveX control you have on your system.
* **Un-register the Flash Player ActiveX Control**

  To un-register the Flash Player ActiveX control, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32.exe /u %windir%\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box confirms that the un-registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Applications and Web sites that require the Flash Player ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Flash Player ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  To reregister the Flash Player ActiveX control, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regsvr32.exe %windir%\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. A dialog box confirms that the registration process has succeeded. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
  3. Close Internet Explorer, and reopen it for the changes to take effect.
* **Restrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder by using a Software Restriction Policy**

  To restrict access to the Macromedia Flash folder (%windir%\system32\Macromed\Flash\) on Windows XP and later versions you can create a [Software Restriction Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/rstrplcy.mspx). To create this policy, use a registry script or create a Group Policy setting to block the loading of the Flash Player ActiveX control.

  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

* **Change your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls or disable ActiveX controls in the Internet security zone and in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings,** in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:

  **Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and "\*.update.microsoft.com" (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the following method:
* **Remove the Flash Player from your system**

  If you want to remove the Macromedia Flash Player, refer to the [Adobe Flash Player Support FAQ](https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_15511) for instructions.

  To regain functionality you need install the current version of the MacromediaFlash Player ActiveX control from the [Adobe Web site](https://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer/).

#### FAQ for Macromedia Flash Player Vulnerabilities - CVE-2006-3311, CVE-2006-3014, CVE-2006-3587, CVE-2006-3588, CVE-2006-4640:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Memory corruptions when loading specially crafted SWF files in the Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file that is designed to exploit one or more of these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The specially crafted SWF file could also be sent as an e-mail attachment. A user would only be at risk if opening this e-mail attachment.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that the Flash Player handles Flash Animation (SWF) files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly disclosed?**

SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
