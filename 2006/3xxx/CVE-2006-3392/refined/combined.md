Yes, it's *very* similar to the exploit I used when I wrote my Nessus
plugin to test for the original flaw:

  <http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=viewsrc&id=21785>

That plugin was first published on 6/30.

The issue with 1.270 involves a failure to sanitize '\' characters in
simplify_path(), while that in 1.280 occurs because simplify_path() is
called before HTML entities are decoded. Sample exploit available on
request.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1199-1                security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Noah Meyerhans
October 23, 2006
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : webmin
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2005-3912 CVE-2006-3392 CVE-2006-4542
BugTraq ID     : 15629 18744 19820
Debian Bug     : 341394 381537 391284

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in webmin, a web-based
administration toolkit.

CVE-2005-3912
	A format string vulnerability in miniserv.pl could allow an
	attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the
	application or exhausting system resources, and could
	potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2006-3392
	Improper input sanitization in miniserv.pl could allow an
	attacker to read arbitrary files on the webmin host by providing
	a specially crafted URL path to the miniserv http server.

CVE-2006-4542
	Improper handling of null characters in URLs in miniserv.pl
	could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks,
	read CGI program source code, list local directories, and
	potentially execute arbirary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.180-3sarge1

Webmin is not included in unstable (sid) or testing (etch), so these
problems are not present.

We recommend that you upgrade your webmin (1.180-3sarge1) package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Webmin, Usermin: File Disclosure — GLSA **200608-11**

Webmin and Usermin are vulnerable to an arbitrary file disclosure through a
specially crafted URL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/webmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.290** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.290** |

| Package | **app-admin/usermin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.220** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.220** |

### Background

Webmin is a web-based interface for Unix-like systems. Usermin is a
simplified version of Webmin designed for use by normal users rather
than system administrators.

### Description

A vulnerability in both Webmin and Usermin has been discovered by Kenny
Chen, wherein simplify\_path is called before the HTML is decoded.

### Impact

A non-authenticated user can read any file on the server using a
specially crafted URL.

### Workaround

For a temporary workaround, IP Access Control can be setup on Webmin
and Usermin.

### Resolution

All Webmin users should update to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot ">=app-admin/webmin-1.290"
```

All Usermin users should update to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot ">=app-admin/usermin-1.220"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
