Description:
I hit a 1-byte buffer overwrite problem in instance manager.

In Instance_options::complete_initialization(), a buffer is allocated and passed to convert_dirname(). However the buffer is too short (convert_dirname() adds stuff at the end), causing buffer overwrite and occational crash.

How to repeat:
mysql-test-run.pl --valgrind-all im_cmd_line

Suggested fix:
I will commit a fix shortly.
