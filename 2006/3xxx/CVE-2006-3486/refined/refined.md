{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer is allocated in `Instance_options::complete_initialization()` and passed to `convert_dirname()`. However, the allocated buffer is too short because `convert_dirname()` adds data at the end, resulting in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The buffer overwrite can lead to a crash of the instance manager.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by running `mysql-test-run.pl --valgrind-all im_cmd_line`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute the `mysql-test-run.pl` script with the `--valgrind-all im_cmd_line` option."
