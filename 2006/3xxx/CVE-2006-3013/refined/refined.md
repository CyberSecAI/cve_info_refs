{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bug in the implementation of the eregi() function in PHP allows an attacker to bypass email validation by injecting a null byte ('\\0') followed by malicious SQL code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation",
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can reset the password of any user account, including administrator accounts, and have the new password sent to an attacker-controlled email. This can lead to complete compromise of the application, including data alteration and access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the password reset functionality by injecting a crafted email address that bypasses validation and manipulates the SQL query.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset page and craft a specific URL containing the malicious payload. No other special access or permissions are required"
