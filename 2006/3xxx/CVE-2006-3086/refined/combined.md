## Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#394444

Original Release Date: 2006-06-21 | Last Revised: 2006-08-22

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Windows system library for handling hyperlinks contains a buffer overflow. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| **Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library (HLINK.DLL)**  The Hyperlink Object Library provides interfaces for handling hyperlinks. More information is available in the Microsoft [Hyperlinks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/misc/hlink/overview/overview.asp) Guide.**The Problem**  There is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library. The overflow may be triggered by clicking a specially crafted hyperlink. Note that any program that links to the HLINK.DLL library may be vulnerable, including Microsoft Office applications.  Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to access a specially crafted hyperlink, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the attacked user. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply update from Microsoft**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-050](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-050.mspx)**.** |
| --- |

| **Do not follow unsolicited hyperlinks**  Do not click on unsolicited links received in email or embedded in Office documents. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to click a specially crafted link. By only accessing hyperlinks from known and trusted sources, the chances of exploitation are reduced. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Hyperlink Object Library. This problem exists because of an unchecked buffer in the code that is used for handling hyperlinks. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious hyperlink which could potentially lead to remote code execution if a user clicks a malicious link within an Office file or e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Mitigating Factors for Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful an attacker must persuade a user to click a link in e-mail message or open an Office file and click a link within that file.

#### Workarounds for Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3086:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. A workaround may not block all attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Modify the Access Control List to deny access to Hlink.dll for all users**
  Disabling the Hlink.dll registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the Hlink.dll registry key:

  + Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **cacls "%windir%\system32\hlink.dll" /d everyone** (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.
* **Modify the Access Control List to disable the HLINK registry key**
  Modifying the Access Control List on the â**HLINK**â registry key helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To modify the registry key, follow these steps.

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  **For Windows 2000**

  **Note** Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedt32**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, expand **CLSID**, and then click **{79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}.**
  3. Click **Security**, and then click **Permissions**.
  4. Click to clear the **Allow Inheritable Permissions from the parent to propagate to this object** check box. You are prompted to click **Copy**, **Remove**, or **Cancel**. Click **Remove**, and then click **OK**.
  5. You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click **Yes** when you are prompted to do so.

  **For Windows XP Service Pack 1 or later operating systems**

  **Note** Make a note of the permissions that are listed in the dialog box so that you can restore them to their original values at a later time

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedit**" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. Expand **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT**, expand **CLSID**, and then click **{79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}**.
  3. Click **Edit**, and then click **Permissions**.
  4. Click **Advanced.**
  5. Click to clear the **Inherit from parent the permission entries that apply to child objects. Include these with entries explicitly defined here.** check box. You are prompted to click **Copy**, **Remove**, or **Cancel**. Click **Remove**, and then check **OK**.
  6. You receive a message that states that no one will be able to access this registry key. Click **Yes**, and then click **OK** to close the **Permissions for {79eac9d0-baf9-11ce-8c82-00aa004ba90b}** dialog box.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users of Office applications will not be able to edit hyperlinks or click on hyperlinks embedded in Office documents.
* **Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.**

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of Workaround:** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Do not click on hyperlinks in Microsoft Office documents from untrusted sources.**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

**File Information**

The English version of this security update has the file attributes that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and Small Business Server 2000:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hlink.dll | 5.2.3790.2748 | 22-Jul-2006 | 03:38 | 72,704 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB920670\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 920670 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
