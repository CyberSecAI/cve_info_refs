    {
      "source": "securityreason.com_c415a4fd_20250124_113730.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `search.php` script of e107 v0.7.5. It doesn't properly sanitize user input in the 'q' parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When a user visits the crafted link, the injected script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `q` parameter of `search.php`"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker only needs to craft a link with malicious javascript in the 'q' parameter and send it to the victim."
      ],
      "additional_details": "The provided example shows a proof-of-concept attack vector using a crafted URL to inject javascript in the search field of e107 v0.7.5 search.php. Additionally, the vulnerability is confirmed by an example comment with javascript injection."
