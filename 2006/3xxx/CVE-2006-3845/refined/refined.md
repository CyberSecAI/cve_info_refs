{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3845",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of constraints when copying data during the concatenation of directory and file names when processing LHA files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to entice a WinRAR user to open a specially crafted LHA file. This file could have any extension as long as WinRAR is configured to process it.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious LHA archive. The user needs to open the crafted archive with a vulnerable version of WinRAR.",
       "additional_details": "Specifically, when processing LHA extended headers, WinRAR reads filename sizes up to 0xFC bytes and directory names up to 0x3FC bytes, and concatenates them into a 0x400 byte buffer. This result is then copied to a 0xFF byte buffer, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow."
