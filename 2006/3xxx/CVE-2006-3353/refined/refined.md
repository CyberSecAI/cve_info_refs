**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific combination of an iframe and Javascript code within an HTML document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Additional Notes**
- The provided exploit code does not directly interact with `palsu.php`, which is included as a `src` attribute for the `iframe` element.
- The JavaScript code checks if the `fake` iframe has a style sheet and then performs an operation on a form named `basicstyle`.
- The provided source includes a link to a live exploit, which may contain more details.
