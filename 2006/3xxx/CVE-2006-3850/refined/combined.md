That's the question, but looking at the source code you mentioned, it
doesn't appear in version 1.0.

It does seem to be a pretty popular product, so maybe older versions are
affected.

However, a source listing of 0.9.2.6 appears to be here:

  <http://phpxref.com/xref/vanilla/>

but "upgrade.php" is not in a setup directory, and it doesn't have the
code you mention.

You mentioned the type in the advisory, but the vendor URL was also wrong,
and the demonstration URL started with "Http".  So there was a lot of
manual typing going on.

Even if it's real, a lot of "researchers" must be doing something like
this:

  egrep '(require|include).*\$' *.php | post-to-bugtraq.pl

Has anyone else looked into the recently announced flaw in "Vanilla
CMS"? Advisory's here:

  <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/440938/30/0/threaded>

I grabbed a copy of the software (it's more of a forum than a CMS) from
here:

  <http://lussumo.com/download.php?Get=Vanilla>

It appears to be version 1.0, and the code quoted in the advisory does
appear in setup/upgrader.php (nb: there is no 'steup/'), which is dated
June 24, 2006. At least in the version I was able to retrieve, I find
immediately before that this snippet:

                                ---- snip, snip, snip ----
$RootDirectory = str_replace('setup/', '', $WorkingDirectory);
$WebRoot = dirname(ForceString(@$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], ''));
$WebRoot = substr($WebRoot, 0, strlen($WebRoot) - 5); // strips the
"setup" off the end of the path.
$BaseUrl = 'http://'.ForceString(@$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], '').$WebRoot;
$ThemeDirectory = $WebRoot . 'themes/';
$AllowNext = 0;
$NewConfiguration = array();

// Assign some default values to the postback parameters
$DBHost = '';
$DBName = '';
$DBUser = '';
$DBPass = '';
$SupportEmail = '';
$SupportName = '';
$ApplicationTitle = '';
                                ---- snip, snip, snip ----

So, does the remote include issue exist in a different version or did
MFox just not look at this carefully?
