**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB920683\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

| Rasadhlp.dll | 5.0.2195.7098 | 07-Jul-2006 | 00:15 | 7,440 | x86 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB920683\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft DNS Client buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#794580

Original Release Date: 2006-08-08 | Last Revised: 2006-08-08

---

### Overview

The Microsoft DNS Client service contains a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

### Description

| From [Microsoft TechNet](http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/Library/6715556b-dfe4-41c4-87a9-333d22e473b21033.mspx?mfr=true):   *The Domain Name System (DNS) client service resolves and caches DNS names. The DNS client service must be running on every computer that will perform DNS name resolution. The ability to resolve DNS names is crucial for locating domain controllers in Active Directory domains. The DNS client service is also critical for locating devices identified using DNS name resolution.* The DNS client layer contains an unchecked buffer which could be exploited by a remote and unauthenticated attacker to gain access to the system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain complete control of a system, including the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts, by one of the following means:   1. Sending a specially crafted DNS communication to an affected system from a subnet between the target host and DNS server; or 2. Convince the target host to make a DNS request to receive a specially crafted record response from an attacking server. |
