Package        : imagemagick
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2440 CVE-2006-3743 CVE-2006-3744
Debian Bug     : 345595

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Imagemagick, a
collection of image manipulation tools, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-2440

    Eero Häkkinen discovered that the display tool allocates insufficient
    memory for globbing patterns, which might lead to a buffer overflow.

CVE-2006-3743

    Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the Sun
    bitmap decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-3744

    Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the XCF
    image decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 6:6.0.6.2-2.7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ImageMagick: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200609-14**

Multiple buffer overflows have been discovered in ImageMagick, which could
potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/imagemagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.2.9.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.2.9.5** |

### Background

ImageMagick is a free software suite to manipulate, convert, and create
many image formats.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a stack and heap
buffer overflow in the GIMP XCF Image decoder and multiple heap and
integer overflows in the SUN bitmap decoder. Damian Put discovered a
heap overflow in the SGI image decoder.

### Impact

An attacker may be able to create a specially crafted image that, when
processed with ImageMagick, executes arbitrary code with the privileges
of the executing user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.9.5"
```

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-23 06:43:53 UTC  ``` As sent to v-s  ===== The sun bitmap decoder is vulnerable to multiple heap buffer overflows due to the absence of bounds checking and unchecked arithmetic operations on attacker supplied values. The DecodeImage() routine from sun.c, line ~170 performs no bounds checking on the inner rle decoding loop, allowing an attacker to use a runlength encoded payload to overflow the destination buffer.  ReadSUNImage() from sun.c, line ~206, performs no range checking on attacker supplied values before using them in arithmetic operations used to allocate memory for decoded image data. A particularly favourable heap layout (callbacks/function pointers easily within reach) results in a trivially exploitable heap overflow.  line 299:  bytes_per_line=2*(sun_info.width*sun_info.depth+15)/16;  sun_pixels=(unsigned char *) AcquireMagickMemory(bytes_per_line*height);  line ~382:  sun_data=(unsigned char *) AcquireMagickMemory((size_t) sun_info.length*sizeof(*sun_data));  The xcf "GIMP Image" decoder suffers from multiple buffer overflows, including a heap and a stack overflow. Both of these are exploitable to execute arbitrary code by supplying an malformed image. The stack buffer overflow is in the PROP_USER_UNIT handling, line ~1097 of xcf.c, where a fixed 1000 byte stack buffer receives a string of length specified by an attacker via the ReadBlobStringWithLongSize() function. The same non-bounds-checking function is used to read the Layer Name onto a heap buffer. This vulnerability also looks exploitable.  Possible fix and testcases attached.  Please credit "Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team" in any advisories relating to these issues. ======== ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-23 06:44:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 94933](attachment.cgi?id=94933 "sun demo") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=94933&action=edit "sun demo")] sun demo ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-23 06:45:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 94934](attachment.cgi?id=94934 "xcf demo") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=94934&action=edit "xcf demo")] xcf demo ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-23 06:45:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 94935](attachment.cgi?id=94935 "patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=94935&action=edit "patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=94935&action=diff "patch")] patch ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-23 08:47:14 UTC  ``` Karol please advise and patch as necessary. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-31 08:19:06 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [143533](show_bug.cgi?id=143533 "RESOLVED FIXED - media-gfx/imagemagick: heap and stack buffer overflow (CVE-2006-374{3|4})") *** ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
