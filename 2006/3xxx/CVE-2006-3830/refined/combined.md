This domain may be listed as a fundamental term by Afnic. Domains listed as fundamental terms are subject to certain registration and trade restrictions.
It is your responsibility to make sure that all of the conditions that are specific to fundamental term domains are fulfilled before bidding and purchasing this domain. These requirements include:
• Why do you wish to register and/or trade this domain?
• What are your reasons/goals for registering/trading this domain?
After receiving these answers, Afnic may request additional documentation from the owner's registrar. Only then will Afnic determine whether or not to approve the registration/trade.
Important Notice:
In order to purchase a .FR domain and successfully transfer it into your ownership, you must have a personal address in Europe, or a business presence with an associated address in Europe.
Please note that it is a requirement of the .FR registry that any registrant of a .FR domain has a European address. If you do not meet either of these requirements, then you will have to transfer the domain to a registrar that provides a trustee service, i.e. a legal proxy address in France.
