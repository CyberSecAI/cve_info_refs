{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows when adding elements to smartlists, improper sanitization of non-printable characters before logging, and unspecified bugs in the directory server and internal circuits.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Improper input sanitization",
    "Unspecified bugs"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code (due to buffer overflow), cause Denial of Service, lack of logged information, and information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending large inputs over the network",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with network access"
}
