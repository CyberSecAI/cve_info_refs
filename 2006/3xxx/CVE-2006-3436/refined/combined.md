#### Vulnerability Note VU#455604

Original Release Date: 2006-10-10 | Last Revised: 2007-06-26

---

### Overview

The Microsoft .NET Framework contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow an attacker to read or modify data in web pages and cookies.

### Description

| The Microsoft [.NET Framework](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663309.aspx) is a managed code programming model for Microsoft Windows operating systems. Microsoft [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/getstarted/default.aspx?tabid=61) is a technology designed to allow programmers to create dynamic web sites and web applications.  A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the .NET Framework 2.0. This vulnerability occurs due to improper validation of HTTP request values. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to obtain sensitive data from a user of a web site running a vulnerable version of the .NET Framework. Depending on the nature of the web site, this data may include passwords, credit card numbers, and any arbitrary information provided by the user. Likewise, information stored in cookies could be stolen or corrupted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-056](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-056.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds for administrators**According to [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-056.mspx), setting the AutoPostBack property to false may mitigate the affects of this vulnerability. See Microsoft Knowledgebase article [328923](http://support.microsoft.com/?id=328923) for more information about the AutoPostBack property.**Workarounds for users**     + Do not follow untrusted hyperlinks, especially if they are sent through email or instant messenger programs. + Disable JavaScript. See the [Securing your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/) document for instructions. Note that disabling JavaScript may reduce the functionality and features provided by some web sites. + TypeURLs directly in the web browser's address bar, or use bookmarks to navigate to web sites. + See the [Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/cross_site_scripting.pdf) document for general information. |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Product | MBSA 1.2.1 | Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **.NET Framework 2.0** | No | Yes | Yes |

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).

**What is the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST)?**

As part of an ongoing commitment to provide detection tools for bulletin-class security updates, Microsoft delivers a stand-alone detection tool whenever the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) and the Office Detection Tool (ODT) cannot detect whether the update is required for an MSRC release cycle. This stand-alone tool is called the Enterprise Update Scan Tool (EST) and is designed for enterprise administrators. When a version of the Enterprise Update Scan Tool is created for a specific bulletin, customers can run the tool from a command-line interface (CLI) and view the results of the XML output file. To help customers better utilize the tool, detailed documentation will be provided with the tool. There is also a version of the tool that offers an integrated experience for SMS administrators.

**Can I use a version of the** **Enterprise** **Update Scan Tool (EST) to determine whether this update is required?**

Yes. Microsoft has created a version of EST that will determine if you have to apply this update. For download links and more information about the version of the EST that is being released this month, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894193](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894193). SMS customers should review the FAQ, âCan I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?" for more information about SMS and EST.

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS detection summary for this security update.

| Product | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **.NET Framework 2.0** | Yes (with the EST) | Yes |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894154/). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460/). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50757). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### .NET Framework 2.0 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3436:

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in a server running a vulnerable version of the .Net Framework 2.0 that could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability require user interaction.

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework 2.0 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3436:

* In a Web-based attack scenario a compromised Web server an attacker could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would require user interaction.
* By default, .NET Framework 2.0 controls do not set the AutoPostBack property to âtrueâ.

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework 2.0 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3436:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **On computers running .NET Framework 2.0, do not set the AutoPostBack property for controls on a page to âtrueâ:** - On computers running .NET Framework 2.0 AutoPostBack is a property of controls on a WebForm. By default the AutoPostBack property is set to **false**. For more information, see[Knowledge Base Article 328923](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=328923).

#### FAQ for .NET Framework 2.0 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2006-3436:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A cross-site scripting vulnerability may exist in a server running a vulnerable version of the .Net Framework 2.0 that could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The vulnerability is within ASP.NET controls that set the AutoPostBack property to âtrueâ. In a Web-based attack scenario a compromised Web site could accept or host user-provided content or advertisements which could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.

The script could take any action on the user's behalf that the Web site is authorized to take. This could include monitoring the Web session and forwarding information to a third party, running other code on the user's system, and reading or writing cookies.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability results from the way that .NET Framework 2.0 validates the value of an HTTP request.

**What is ASP.NET?**

[ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/) is a collection of technologies within the.NET Framework that enable developers to build Web applications and XML Web Services.

Unlike traditional Web pages, which use a combination of static HTML and scripting, ASP.NET uses compiled, event-driven pages. This enables developers to build Web-based applications with the same richness and functionality usually associated with applications built in languages such as Visual Basic or Visual C++. Because ASP.NET is a Web-based application environment, it requires an underlying Web server to provide basic HTTP functionality. For this reason, ASP.NET runs on top of Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 on Windows 2000, IIS 5.1 on Windows XP, and IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003.

**What is AutoPostBack?**

AutoPostBack is a property supported by controls in a form. Forms using a control that supports this property can set the value of this property to true (the default value is false) which results in control posting back to the server each time a user interacts with the control.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to "inject" script code into a user's session with a Website. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**How does cross-site scripting work?**

Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that this injection has occurred and to take protective measures.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability on a server running a vulnerable version of the .Net Framework 2.0, could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would require user interaction.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

In an e-mail attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted e-mail message to a user of a server that is running an affected software application. The attacker could then persuade the user to click a link in the e-mail message.

In a Web-based attack scenario a compromised Web an attacker could inject a client side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected web site. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability would require user interaction.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet facing systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal Web sites that use ASP.NET to host sensitive data can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that .ASP.NET validates the value of a HTTP request.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
