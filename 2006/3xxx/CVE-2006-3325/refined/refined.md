  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The Quake 3 engine's automatic downloading feature and cvar handling have vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Directory traversal bypass in automatic download feature using a crafted filename string that avoids adding the `.pk3` extension to the local filename due to length limitations.",
        "Unrestricted cvar overwriting, including write-protected cvars, via server-sent systemInfo string."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite, information stealing, and arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via a malicious server exploiting the automatic downloading feature.",
		 "Remote attack by a malicious server exploiting cvar overwriting"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must control a Quake 3 server that the vulnerable client connects to."
    },
  {
      "root_cause": "The Quake 3 engine's 'Automatic Downloading' feature allows clients to automatically download files from the server.  This process uses  `Q_strcat` and is vulnerable due to how it handles filenames exceeding a certain length",
      "weaknesses": [
         "The `Q_strcat` function used to construct the neededpaks buffer does not correctly handle filenames that approach the buffer limit of 1023 bytes.",
		 "The server can manipulate the client into downloading an arbitrary file by sending a specially crafted string containing filenames such that it causes `Q_strcat` to exceed the buffer limit. This bypasses security checks"
       ],
      "impact": "This can lead to overwriting of arbitrary files in any disk of the computer in which Quake 3 is running. This includes system files or configuration files.  It can also create new files with any extension",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack through a malicious server"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the Quake 3 server"
    },
   {
      "root_cause": "The server sends a string, which contains cvars (variables) that are automatically set on the client when a player joins. These are part of the systemInfo string sent by the server.",
      "weaknesses": [
		"The client does not validate that the server is sending correct cvar values.",
        "The client automatically sets cvars received in the systemInfo string without proper validation or sanitization. This includes write-protected cvars.",
       ],
      "impact": "Attackers can enable the Automatic Downloading feature, modify file paths, potentially leading to arbitrary file overwrites.  The overwrite can also lead to information stealing through compromised configuration files. It can also lead to other unspecified malicious intents",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack through a malicious server"
      ],
