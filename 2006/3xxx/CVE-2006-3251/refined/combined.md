hashcash-1.22 - 08-Apr-2006 - Adam Back
\* fix progress display bug reported by Phil Marek. (When the
progress reached 2^30 tests, it would reset the best seen).
This involved multiple related bug fixes, complex thing to
debug!
\* make percentage progress show more precision the larger the
stamp, so progress is less boring.
\* remove some cruft from test.sh so it works again
\* change docs and code output to talk about partial hash
preimages instead of partial collisions, as this is a more
accurate description these days.
hashcash-1.21 - 24-Mar-2006 - Adam Back
\* fix potential heap overflow bug reported by
Andreas Seltenreich
hashcash-1.20 - 20-Dec-2005 - Adam Back
\* fix bug that -w reports using version 0 semantics even with
version 1 stamps (was ignoring the version field and so
defaulting to version 0 semantics).
\* rest are fedora core4 related fixes
\* remove dependency on openssl libcrypto.so.4 -- I compile rpm
on rh9 for forwards compatibility, but then on fc4 they have only
libcrypto.so.5, so the rpm fails to install with missing
dependency. Dependencies are ugly so I built with static link to
libcrypto.a instead of dynamic to libcrypto.so.
\* -mcpu is deprecated apparently so I am supposed to use the
equivalent -mtune, but that doesn't work on rh9 era gcc
compilers so used -march=pentium-mmx instead; I think the
result should still work on 486 via Jonathan's exception
catcher trapping absense of mmx cpu.
\* the (mode) syntax for mmx registers is deprecated, apparently
we're supposed to use (vector\_size)
\* with fc4 the strncpy builtin is more fussy about char/unsigned
char matching.
\* with fc4 rpmbuild options getting warnings about ignoring fgets
return code
hashcash-1.19 - 17-Dec-2005 - Adam Back
\* update to documentation for hashcash\_free in hashcash.h at
Simon Bohlin's suggestion
\* fix for -mb0 reported by bas
hashcash-1.18 - 05-Jul-2005 - Adam Back
\* add a simpler minting API to make it easier to mint stamps
from VB scripting
hashcash-1.17 - 30-Mar-2005 - Adam Back
\* fix for bug Steve Crook reported with purging and checking
at same time.
\* fix for bug Steve Crook reported in double spend checking.
(Was bug in new hashcash\_db\_in higher level db function).
\* apply patch from Jonathan Morton which fixes bug triggered
when minting large stamps (over 31-bits).
\* fix printf vulnerability reported by Tavis Ormandy
hashcash-1.16 - 15-Jan-2005 - Adam Back
\* fixed bug with -Z2 (and removed workaround mentioned in 1.15
changelog entry)
hashcash-1.15 - 12-Jan-2005 - Adam Back
\* make "Hashcash:" be accepted as well as "X-Hashcash:"
suggestion by Simon Josefsson . This way
if/when the X- is dropped from hashcash headers we will not
have a backwards compatibility problem. (Well not after
version 1.15).
\* implement the -Z option to compress stamps; in fact the
usage changed so -Z takes an argument: 0, 1 or 2. 0 = not
compressed, 1 = compressed but not so the counter + padding
is split, and 2 = very compressed, but slow. (Due to a late
discovered bug 2 is the same as 1 for now until I can fix
that.)
\* added -O x -sv to request benchtest of core x only
\* make code work with -DOPENSSL, think this slipped during
integration of Jonathan's libfastmint as it uses some lower
level openssl APIs internally. I fixed it but it might be
a bit openssl version specific, if they changed the state
fields at any point. (This change coincidentally I think
should work around the linking with openssl problem that Hal
Finney  reported).
\* add libhashcash.a intermediate target to make hashcash more
convenient to link into other software on linux. (A
suggestion from Hal Finney who was trying to link to his
RPOW system.)
hashcash-1.14 - 14-Dec-2004 - Adam Back
\* make hashcash -cX accept continuation lines starting with
space as well as tab
\* add library function to wrap lines and use it from hashcash
command line tool.
\* fix long vs time\_t prototype mismatch that was giving
compile errors on BSD; also cleaned up some warnings that
can be obtained with gcc -Wall.
hashcash-1.13 - 16-Oct-2004 - Adam Back
\* fix bug where grace period not applied to double-spend db.
I think this could allow people to double-spend in the time
period after the resulting premature purging and before
expiry (which is the grace period)
\* add new feature where -e  can be used with -p to
override the expiry given at spend time (that is stored in
the double-spend db). Inspired by question from Atom
Smasher .
\* clean up some memory leaks
\* add hashcash\_free function (DLL scenario caller can't rely
on having same deallocator to call as library compiled with)
\* lots more function documentation in hashcash.h for
library/DLL users, renamed all exported library functions to
start with hashcash\_ prefix.
\* added hashcash\_version function.
\* added callback function to allow user quit (returns
HASHCASH\_USER\_ABORT) and to give progress feedback.
\* added option -P which uses the callback to show progress.
\* added -O core option to allow user selection of core.
\* added small parameter to hashcash (to request small stamps
rather than slightly larger fast to generate stamps), and -Z
option to turn this on. (In fact it is not implemented yet
but want to avoid changing library interface later).
hashcash-1.12 - 03-Oct-2004 - Adam Back
\* make a HASHCASH.DLL on windows using MINGW.
hashcash-1.11 - 02-Oct-2004 - Adam Back
\* \_really\_ fix trailing ascii(32) (spaces). I have no idea
how I decided the 1.10 code fixed it. Must have messed up
the test I was using to check it worked.
hashcash-1.10 - 01-Oct-2004 - Adam Back
\* remove trailing ascii(32) (spaces) which padding somehow
leaves
hashcash-1.09 - 17-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* fix missing space between resource name and width with -cv
reported by Panta Admin.
\* apply cumulative patch of 3 patches from Jonathan Morton.
hashcash-1.08 - 12-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* fix bug reported by Panta Admin
must have introduced in recent version where with pipe
prints stamp twice.
\* attempt to work around MINGW problem with signals -- somehow
it is changing it's mind about whether the MMX core can run
from the first call to the 2nd call. But the test result
is cached so it is hard to see how this happens. Not clear
if this work-around will work as don't have a 486 to test
on. (Work around is make single gIsMMXpresent shared
between the two mmx cores, should at least result in signal
call being used fewer times (max 1 time). Also pass 1 to
longjmp.)
\* give up entirely on conditional make. One Makefile, no
funky stuff. Prints info about what you need to do to
compile on your platform and goes ahead and compiles with
generic anyway. Make new gnu (generic) target for gcc, and
normal generic with no gcc specific flags.
hashcash-1.07 - 11-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* patch from J H Wilson  to initialize a bunch
of variables (actually I had to back some of these out to
get to compile on non gnu compilers -- some of those
structure initializations are gnu extensions I think.)
\* also J H Wilson one of patch changes was to avoid mmx
assembler code clobbering ebx register which is needed for
fPIC support.
\* better randomness on windows using the CAPI rng
CryptGenRandom. Still compiles using MINGW ... whee!
\* made a separate GNUmakefile for gnu make (it takes that one
first over Makefile) and a Makefile which is the same but no
ifdef stuff which confuses some other makes, and no gnu
specific compile options (for x86 anyway).
\* add gettimeofday timer into entropy to improve randomness on
systems which do not have /dev/urandom, and are not windows
hashcash-1.06 - 10-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* patch from Justin Guyett  to fix unsigned
error which would have made libfastmint do something odd if
no minter worked.
\* Makefile changes to compile under MINGW (gnu for windows
portability layer which produces win32 exes). new target
mingw-exe
\* #ifdefs to avoid locking on MINGW (seems no lock support!)
\* #ifdefs to use longjmp instead of siglongjmp, signal instead
of sigaction on MINGW
\* #ifdef to use chsize instead of ftruncate on MINGW
hashcash-1.05 - 08-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* and another issue (last I promise!) with case comparison.
1.04 change was good; however flaw in 1.02 means 1.04 minted
stamps (resource not canonicalized to lowercase) can falsely
fail to verify with 1.02 - 1.00 as those versions presume
canonicalized stamp. So we go back to making -C have effect
on minting also. With no -C canonicalize to lowercase, with
-C use resource as-is.
\* get rid of -W flag reserved for posix, use -M in it's place.
hashcash-1.04 - 07-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* fixed issue with case comparisons -- presumed resources were
in lower case at minting -- better to just ignore case
during comparison. Then will accept stamps containing upper
case or mixed-case resource names.
\* integrate fastmint\_benchtest as -sv option to hashcash.
\* introduce COPT as well as CFLAGS as optimization subset of
flags passed with CFLAGS to nested make -- suits RPM
hashcash-1.03 - 07-Sep-2004 - Adam Back
\* remove TARGET\_ARCH again, let's keep things simple. Just
use CFLAGS period.
\* figured out what GENTOO ebuild is doing, changed ebuild file
\* remove recursion from hashcash\_fastmint
\* start using TARGET\_ARCH in Makefile, hope it's portable;
it's an attempt to be more GENTOO ebuild friendly
\* Makefile change: when PACKAGE is defined build default
target, otherwise echo the target info as before
\* removed a bunch of old code replaced by fastmint, got rid of
CHROMATIX define
\* fix following errors reported by Atom Smasher
\* fix width measuring bug with v0 stamps
\* fix resource read from stdin bug
\* use GNU getopt source always -- getopt
on BSD behaves differently (the getopt source is
smart -- it comments itself out on machines with
GNU\_LIBRARY so using it always is not a problem)
\* bug: should send the time estimate to
stderr, and the stamp to stdout
\* -z width flag not properly error checked
to enforce UTCTIME restrictions (only valid widths
6, 10 or 12 digits)
\* update LICENSE to note you end up with some GNU GPL taint
from getopt on systems without POSIX getopt which probably
forces you to use GPL as I link against it. Unless someone
wants to re-write the getopt or can point me at a public
domain replacement. In particular this includes BSD and
MACH (OSX) and as before windows.
\* apply patch from Jonathan Morton
with following fixes:
\* fix bug in mmx assembler code exposed by integration
\* add generic target in Makefile
\* increase benchmark work factor to improve accuracy of
results (as not used at run-time)
\* new hashcash\_quickbench()
\* changes to hashcash\_quickbench() to give faster timing on
linux x86 which has low resolution clock() (1/100th sec vs
1usec on OSX). (It was taking ~ 0.6sec on linux x86, code
takes 0.1 sec now which is less noticeable)
\* related to above studiously avoided calling hc\_per\_sec()
which invokes hashcash\_quickbench() -- seems a shame to burn
1/10th sec in default mint creation path if user typically
doesn't care about the info about how long it took. Now you
have to give -s or -v to get speed info when minting.
\* fix case sensitivity bug reported by Atom Smasher
\* add CPL option back to LICENSE file
\* add make targets for different processors
\* remove 2nd call of hashcash\_benchtest (supposed to call
hc\_per\_second which caches not hashcash\_per\_second)
\* enable static selection of fastmint cores, disable run
time benchtest
\* applied fastmint fix patch from Jonathan Morton
 and re-enabled fastmint
(remove -DCHROMATIX in Makefile to disable)
hashcash-1.02 - 11-Aug-2004 - Adam Back
\* minor documentation stuff (put back ref to sha1-hashcash in
hashcash.pod manpage)
\* add back requests to LICENSE file
hashcash-1.01 - 08-Aug-2004 - Adam Back
\* fold in patches from by Hubert Chan
 and Justin Guyett  to
clean up some stuff and fix minor bugs.
\* another couple of minor bug fixes.
hashcash-1.00 - 07-Aug-2004 - Adam Back
\* increment version number, 1.x to reflect move to version 1
stamp format
\* explicit bits field in token (helps people who want to
prevalidate header and parse, and who want to know what the
intended bits were vs how lucky the sender got); new stamp
size definition is min( counted\_bits, explicit bits field )
\* no : in resource field to make easier to parse eg with cut,
awk etc
\* new extension field
\* reclaimed -x to use for passing eXtension data (old -x no longer
available, use -X, which has string fixed to X-Hashcash)
\* put /dev/urandom macro for MAC from
Jonathan Morton  so we use
/dev/urandom on MAC
\* copy in and adjust Makefile for Jonathan Morton's optimized
minter (need to integrate)
\* copy in Jonathan Morton's COMPACT option (method B vs method A
from fips-180-1, uses less registers) for libsha1.c
\* copy in next rev of minter breaks 4megahashes/sec barrier on
3.06Ghz P4 -- disabled at present until some stuff gets
fixed and we figure out rpm/deb package portability
\* added back v0 read support (but still only generates v1)
\* pr5: first attempt at integrating libfastmint (some bug in
my integration code, broken so far)
\* (pr6: libfastmint integ still not working)
\* pr6: made X-Hashcash header accepatance case insensitive
\* pr7: also reject tokens with count\_bits < claimed\_bits
(as previous logic of setting bits = min( count\_bits, claimed\_bits)
necessary to avoid people getting lucky
\* use clock() instead of wall time
\* expand max stamp size out to cope with 10KB extension fields
\* update man page and usage with v1 stuff
\* and release as 1.00 ready for Hubert Chan
to package for the imminent debian release
hashcash-0.33 - 13-Apr-2004 - Adam Back
\* allow wild card without @ sign if there is no @ sign in
pattern
hashcash-0.32 - 09-Apr-2004 - Adam Back
\* documentation fixes
\* change multiple regexp behavior; previous algorithm only allowed
higher overrides; need to support both higher and lower
overrides. This also required introducing -o option to join
regexps which are set intersections where otherwise risk of
uninteded override occuring and mail being rejected as spent or
insufficent bits. Now revert to lexical order most specific
regexp first.
\* wrote test script test.sh
\* fix a few minor bugs uncovered by above test script
\* -c now means check date
\* allow -n etc with -X
\* introduced -b relative to default way of specifying bits
\* -b is no optional, if want token fully checked, but can give -b
default; or new relative to default -b +0.
hashcash-0.31 - 01-Apr-2004 - Adam Back
\* final 0.x version (v0 format) release before 1.x version (v1
format) (bug fixes / maintenance only afterwards on 0.x version)
\* remove -O3 from Makefile, use -O instead as fails on HPUX or
sun.
\* fix some out of date usage stuff in hashcash man page.
\* disable timing loop unless timing needed
\* fix multiple reciept bug in -cX/-cx reported by Junior Ang
. If you receive a mail multiple times
because you are on the receipt list multiple times, there will
be multiple hashcash headers for you. In this case it is
necessary to examine the first matching, non-spent stamp. The
bug was previous versions stopped on the first matching stamp
and then failed because it was spent. Need to keep going and
check later also matching stamps until find one which is not
spent.
\* rationalize command line args further. No implied -m , more
things that are awkward to implement but not that useful are
disallowed.
\* change purge operation to use read-write operations in the same
sdb file rather than creating a temporary file. This makes
locking easier and is also aesthetically nicer.
\* add flock(2) database file write locking, and change creation
logic to use open(2) to avoid creation db race-condition also.
\* make resource string case insensitive by default to match email
semantics; add -C option to force case sensitivity if desired
(email addresses are converted to and stored in lower case, so
you have to both mint and verify with case sensitivity turned on
to make use of case sensitivity)
\* support minting multiple resources with multiple command line
args. Also if no resources given on command line, read
resources from stdin.
\* support supplying multiple email addresses, for people who want
to accept as multiple addresses.
\* support multiple resources on purging also.
\* support multiple tokens with check mode as cmd line args, if
none given as args, read tokens from stdin; if -X/-x read from
cmd line args, then from stdin as email (matching stamp headers
skipping stamp headers)
\* rename default simple database to hashcash.sdb (.sdb extension),
to distinguish from planned support for better database.
\* fix bug in PPUTS didn't match PPRINTF
\* fixup -l, -w, -n so they support multiple tokens also
\* made use of -b optional (get the default on mint & check)
\* added "-b default" to specify default number of bits with -s
(otherwise no way to measure the default speed without
specifying the number of bits -- and when this can change over
time it would be inconvenient for scripting to have to
separately obtain this)
\* added support for wildcard email addresses with '\*' wildcard
marker. '\*' before '@' does not match '@', '\*' after '@' does
not match '.'. And both email addresses must contain @ sign and
same number of '.' separated sub domains as wildcard address.
Wildcard matching is the new default. Use -S to get plain
string match. Can turn back on with -W.
\* increased size of random string to reduce chance of collisions
between users. Now negligible chance of collision with typical
token sizes.
\* added support for regexps. Can work from POSIX library or BSD
regexp library. Use -E to get regexps. Input is always in
POSIX syntax (specials are not quoted to have special action;
are quoted to have plain meaning). If using BSD library still
give input in POSIX syntax, it's converted to BSD internally.
\* implement highest matching semantics. Ensures that eg -c -b10
\*@bar.invalid -b15 adam@bar.invalid will not accept a 10 bit
token for adam@bar.invalid. (This is done by sorting resources
highest bits required first and accepting only the first highest
matching resource.)
\* change arg parsing so -b, -e, -g, -z, -E, -W, -S, apply to the
following resources and tokens, and can be changed for later
resources/tokens with tokens and args interspersed. Means you
have to give these args before the resource/token or you will
get defaults.
hashcash-0.30 - 04-Mar-2004 - Adam Back
\* make -cX check multiple X-Hashcash lines until it finds the
right one. Bug reported by Kyle Hasselbacher .
hashcash-0.29 - 04-Mar-2004 - Adam Back
\* fix prototype mismatch of function hashcash\_check in
hashcash.h vs libhc.c which caused compile failure on
openBSD and freeBSD
\* change to make it compile on MAC OSX (need to recognize OSX
and treat as unix like for headers to include)
\* change to make it compile on solaris 9 (and POSIX / SVR
systems in general). Turns out putenv(3) is more portable
than setenv(3) / unsetenv(3)
\* update sha1 man page to name it sha1-hashcash to avoid collision
with openssl sha1(1). By default with openssl there is not
actually any program named sha1, rather sha1 is a subprogram of
openssl invoked "openssl sha1". However I think it may still be
possible to compile that as a separate program or symlink sha1 to
openssl to get that.
\* update sha1 man pages to refer to the other common sha1
implementations.
\* update LICENSE request
hashcash-0.28 - 18-Sep-2003 - Adam Back
\* fix bug with timezone handling reported by Joris Bontje
 (turns out utctime function is
redundant and wrong; time(2) gives time in UTCTime (doh)).
Reason for confusion is ctime is in local time, so converts
UTC time into local time even if you don't want that. But
c-library time handling functions are really not designed
for converting back from local to UTCTime when represented
as a time\_t. Changed a bunch of time related stuff to fix
this up.
\* add -g flag for grace period suggested by Marc Lehmann
 to avoid undue rejection of hashcash stamps
because of clock skew (or timezone / daylight savings time
off by one errors). Default for email is 2 days (48 hours)
fast or slow.
\* change validity period default to 28 days; previous default
was forever which did not match recommended email default
\* add -z flag to explicitly specify the width in chars of the
time field. This flag deprecates and overrides the -m -e
way to implicitly specify date field width. As before the
default is 6 chars (date only in YYMMDD).
hashcash-0.27 - 11-Sep-2003 - Adam Back
\* add space char after 'X-Hashcash:' header that you get with
-X option
\* add LICENSE file
hashcash-0.26 - 26-Jun-2003 - Adam Back
\* accidentally folded in some non-standard VERBOSE output I was
playing with. This change makes it really standard output
comparable to FIPS 180-1 appendices.
\* added a version number -- use -V to display it. Also -v
(lowercase) by itself with no other arguments displays the
version umber also.
\* bug fix for quiet output (when not going to a pipe, still
need to see output!)
\* update everything to point at http://www.hashcash.org now we
have the domain courtesy of it's previous owner Ashish
Gulhati  (at no charge -- he declined my
offer to pay for it and instead gave it to me!)
\* made a man page for sha1 utility also.
\* add -X option which is a shorthand version of -x 'X-Hashcash:'
\* remove leading and trailing blanks from hashcash tokens to
make them more robustly survive email transit.
hashcash-0.25 - 15-May-2003 - Adam Back
\* fix VERBOSE trace output of sha1 implementation to match FIPS
180-1 standard test vector examples (Note: this no impact on the
result, just allows direct comparison to the test vectors in
180-1). The FIPS 180-1 VERBOSE output got broken when I unrolled
the rotates in the round function.
\* remove the automatic turning on of quiet mode if the output
is a pipe per note from Simon Josefsson  about
how that can be inconvenient for scripting
hashcash-0.24 - 15-Mar-2003 - Adam Back
\* fix minor error which made hashcash\_expected\_tries a tiny
amount less efficient than realised
hashcash-0.23 - 15-Mar-2003 - Adam Back
\* fix error in libhc would always fail in hashcash\_check
reported by Alan Barclay ; note this
bug does not affect the hashcash command line tool as it does not
use this API
\* minor Makefile changes
hashcash-0.22 - 16-Aug-2002 - Adam Back
\* fix uninitialized counter string in hashcash\_per\_sec, bug
reported by Mathias Langer
hashcash-0.21 - 15-Aug-2002 - Adam Back
\* fix compile warnings with VC++ 6.

in them (eg. urls etc)
\* change hashcash\_mint API a bit
\* add programming APIs for all other functions except
double spend db, and move library code to libhc.c
hashcash-0.17 - 23-Mar-2002 - Adam Back
\* add programming API for hashcash\_mint
\* separate hashcash tool program from hashcash library code
\* remove trailing 'Z' option for times -- adds no value
hashcash-0.16 - 15-Mar-2002 - Adam Back
\* minor clean up stuff:
\* allow longer collision strings for compatibility with future
versions
\* reject collision strings with non-printable and non ascii
chars (< ascii(32) and > ascii(127)
\* make install now installs man page
\* fix VMS compile warning
\* fix bad portability assumption about time\_t being signed
\* simple VMS scripting build script
hashcash-0.15 - 14-Mar-2002 - Adam Back

\* update documentation
\* re-implement SDB simple database to have a more standard
interface to facilitate plugging in gdb etc
\* import random number interface to /dev/urandom

\* update documentation
hashcash-0.12 - 03-Mar-2002 - Adam Back
\* add option to verify resource name given on command line
matches resource name in collision
\* also more compatible with 0.10 command line as a result
\* add option to print resource name parsed from collision
hashcash-0.11 - 02-Mar-2002 - Adam Back
\* fix buffer overflow reported by Max Greenius
\* add -v mode suggested by Michael Shinn
\* add interactive mode instead of usage as default, another
suggestion from Michael Shinn

\* add -q mode for even quieter output (batch like mode)
\* add -x option to take collision to verify from stdin
\* update the documentation in readme.txt to reflect
new format and options
\* add install target to makefile to install binaries
for hashcash and sha1 in /usr/local/bin, another
suggestion from Michael Shinn

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Hashcash: Possible heap overflow — GLSA **200606-25**

A heap overflow vulnerability in the Hashcash utility could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/hashcash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.21** |

### Background

Hashcash is a utility for generating Hashcash tokens, a proof-of-work
system to reduce the impact of spam.

### Description

Andreas Seltenreich has reported a possible heap overflow in the
array\_push() function in hashcash.c, as a result of an incorrect amount
of allocated memory for the "ARRAY" structure.

### Impact

By sending malicious entries to the Hashcash utility, an attacker may
be able to cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Hashcash users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/hashcash-1.21"
```
