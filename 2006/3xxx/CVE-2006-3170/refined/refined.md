    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3170",
      "source": "securityreason.com_ed3242eb_20250124_174203.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Full Path Disclosure due to insecure handling of user inputs and system information.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Input is not properly sanitized when reflected back to user.",
        "SQL Injection: User-controlled input is directly used in SQL queries, allowing malicious SQL code to be executed.",
         "Full Path Disclosure: Application reveals the full path to files in error messages or debugging output"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, gain unauthorized access to the database, and reveal sensitive information about the application's file system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable parameters such as `msg_result`, `rep_titre` and cookies.",
        "SQL Injection: By manipulating the `id`, `search`, and `debut` parameters to inject SQL queries.",
        "Full Path Disclosure: By accessing the `index.php` with specific parameters that lead to display an error message that shows the system file path."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send specially crafted requests to the server. This can be accomplished through a web browser or via scripts."
