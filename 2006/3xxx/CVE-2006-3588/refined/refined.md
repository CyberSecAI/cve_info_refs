  "CVE-2006-3588": {
    "Description": "Multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe because of the way that it handles Flash Animation (SWF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by constructing a specially crafted Flash Animation (SWF) file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a Web site containing the specially crafted SWF file. The specially crafted SWF file could also be sent as an e-mail attachment.",
    "Root cause": "Memory corruptions when loading specially crafted SWF files in the Macromedia Flash Player from Adobe.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Multiple input validation errors"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could entice a user to view a malicious Flash file and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the player. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a web site containing a specially crafted SWF file through Internet Explorer",
      "Opening a specially crafted SWF file as an e-mail attachment"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to host a web site containing a specially crafted SWF file or send an email with the malicious SWF attachment. The user must then visit the malicious web site or open the malicious e-mail attachment."
