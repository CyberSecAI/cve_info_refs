  "CVE-2006-3304": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in DeluxeBB versions 1.07 and earlier, allowing a remote attacker to create an administrator account without proper authentication. This vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request that bypasses security checks.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control and a lack of proper checks in the user management functionality of DeluxeBB. Specifically, the application does not properly validate user roles before allowing actions such as setting admin privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Missing input validation",
        "Lack of authorization checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can create a new administrator account with full control over the forum, potentially leading to data manipulation, defacement, or complete takeover of the web application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to create an admin account."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable application and its exposed functionalities (specifically `misc.php` and `cp.php`)"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The exploit involves first logging in with any user credentials, then sending a crafted GET request to the `cp.php` page with specific parameters that promote the logged-in user to administrator. This demonstrates the application's failure to properly validate user roles and permissions.",
