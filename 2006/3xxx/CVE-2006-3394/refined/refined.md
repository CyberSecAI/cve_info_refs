            "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with the `mod=files` and `action=view` parameters, using a maliciously crafted `where` parameter."

          "additional_information": "The exploit uses a SQL UNION statement to inject a query that retrieves user nicknames and passwords from the `users` table, bypassing the intended logic of the application. The exploit is implemented as a Perl script that sends the malicious HTTP GET request and parses the response to extract the user's hash."
