Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed to a SQL query in the `galeria.php` file of the IMGallery application. Specifically, the `$sort` parameter obtained from the `GET` request is directly inserted into the `ORDER BY` clause of the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Other variables such as `$kategoria`, `$album`, and `$fraza` obtained from the `GET` request are also likely vulnerable to SQL injection, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `$sort` parameter before its use in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query execution.
- Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities may exist through other GET variables used in the SQL query (`$kategoria`, `$album`, and `$fraza`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `$sort` parameter, potentially allowing them to:
    - Access sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Modify or delete existing data.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server, depending on database permissions and the injection technique used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `sort` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `galeria.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable IMGallery application.
- No specific authentication or prior knowledge of the database structure may be required for the initial exploitation, which would make it a low-skill attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content clarifies that the vulnerable file is `galeria.php`, not `galerie.php` as mentioned in some other sources.
- The content highlights that other parameters passed in the query might also be vulnerable to SQL injection but does not provide explicit proof.
