{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Writable form fields and hidden fields can be manipulated by using hyphens to inject and execute malicious script code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can pass malicious code into another user's browser session, potentially leading to privilege escalation (e.g., extracting sensitive cookie information, launching a buffer overflow attack against another web browser). Because authentication frontends are affected, it can have a serious impact on secure environments.",
    "attack_vectors": "Classic script injection techniques within a browser session can be used. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by manipulating form fields or hidden fields.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability."
  },
    "affected_products": [
    "F5 FirePass 4100 prior 6.x"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was identified in version 5.x, and while the remaining existence of it could not be verified in version 6.x, it is believed to be fixed in 6.x. A plugin for the 'Attack Tool Kit' (ATK) framework was planned for publication."
