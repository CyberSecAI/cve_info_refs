{
  "CVE-2006-3747": {
    "Root cause": "An off-by-one error exists in the ldap scheme handling in the mod_rewrite module of the Apache HTTP server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Off-by-one error leading to a buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server user. The vulnerability can also cause a denial of service (DoS). Successful exploitation may be dependent on the stack frame layout of Apache running on the target host.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via specially crafted URLs, where the attacker has some control over the beginning of the rewritten URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The server must have mod_rewrite enabled, with a configuration that uses vulnerable rules, meaning RewriteRules where the remote user can influence the beginning of a rewritten URL and that do not include any of the Forbidden (F), Gone (G), or NoEscape (NE) flags."
