# USN-350-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

22 September 2006

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)

## Details

This update upgrades Thunderbird from 1.0.8 to 1.5.0.7. This step was

necessary since the 1.0.x series is not supported by upstream any

more.

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2006-3113](/security/CVE-2006-3113), [CVE-2006-3802](/security/CVE-2006-3802), [CVE-2006-3803](/security/CVE-2006-3803), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805),

[CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806), [CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3810](/security/CVE-2006-3810),

[CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-3812](/security/CVE-2006-3812), [CVE-2006-4253](/security/CVE-2006-4253), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4566](/security/CVE-2006-4566), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the handling of .vcard files.

By tricking a user into importing a malicious vcard into his contacts,

this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user's

privileges. ([CVE-2006-3804](/security/CVE-2006-3804))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users

into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal

SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to

spoof the victim's DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the

attacker's choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If

they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker's cert

for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be

hijacked and redirected to the attacker's site without detection.

([CVE-2006-4567](/security/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))

The "enigmail" plugin and the translation packages have been updated

to work with the new Thunderbird version.

### Reduce your security exposure

these problems. An update will be provided shortly.

Attached patch

[Fix (by capping the argument length).](attachment.cgi?id=229565&action=diff)
â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=229565&action=edit)
â [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=344960&attachment=229565)

Cap the constructor argument length at 2k to keep windows string code from crashing (due to OOM). This also fixes a bug where we were incorrectly protecting against an empty string argument (null checked the wrong variable).

I don't know if it \_works\_, but GeckoActiveXObject still exists on windows builds of 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 and XPC\_IDISPATCH\_SUPPORT is enabled in the build.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-48

## JavaScript new Function race condition

Announced
July 25, 2006
Reporter
H. D. Moore
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.0.3
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.5

### Description

H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to trigger a race
condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a temporary
variable still being used in the creation of a new Function object.
The resulting use of a deleted object may be potentially exploitable
to run native code provided by the attacker.

This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development, it does
not affect Firefox 1.0 or Mozilla Suite 1.7

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and would be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from enabling
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version. Do not enable
JavaScript in mail clients such as Thunderbird.

From H D Moore <hdm@metasploit.com>:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This bug is really annoying to track down, it seems like changing anything
in the script prevents the EIP hijack from working. Hope it works for
you, I can reliably reproduce here (Windows XP SP2 - FF 1.5.0.4).

Ok, I crash with a 2006-03-23 build, but don't crash with a 2006-03-24 trunk build. I tested this multiple times and on 2 different machines.
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=HEAD&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2006-03-23+05&maxdate=2006-03-24+06&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot>
Note, I had to disable Java, because otherwise it would crash on the Java part in trunk (I think that's a known bug on trunk, at least there are some known Java crashers on trunk).

I think I may have reduced it to this. However, I'm not sure (since I can't really reproduce the crash with the original testcase in FF1.5.0.5RC3).
But I am sure, that the first button is crashing also Firefox1.5.0.5RC3.
The second button is only crashing current trunk builds.

A typical talkback I get from testcase2 in Firefox1.5 is TB20978230Z:
kernel32.dll + 0x1eb33 (0x7c81eb33)
\_CxxThrowException
\_com\_error::\_com\_error
\_com\_issue\_error
CommonConstructor [c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Mozilla1.8.0-Release/WINNT\_5.2\_Depend/mozilla/js/src/xpconnect/src/XPCIDispatchExtension.cpp, line 90]
ActiveXConstructor
etc...
That's quite different from the original testcase, so that's why I'm not sure it's the same bug.

Crashing [@ 0x20202113] in the JavaScript engine probably means this is a GC hazard bug. GC hazard bugs tend to be hard to reduce :( I think the fastest way to get this fixed on 1.5.0.x is to determine what trunk patch fixed it.
Martijn, is the "fixed on trunk" period you gave in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate") for the GC-hazard-looking crash in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate"), or is it for the ActiveX crash in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate")? I'm hoping it's the latter, since there weren't any changes to the JavaScript engine or XPConnect on that day that look like GC hazard fixes.Keywords: [crash](/buglist.cgi?keywords=crash&resolution=---)Summary: EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 â EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS\_SetPrivateWhiteboard: [sg:critical?]Version: Trunk â 1.8 Branch

I couldn't reproduce the original testcase either until I created a new profile, then \*boom\*. So if you're having trouble reproducing, try that. There's probably some common power-user pref setting a lot of us have that's interfering.
I died in JS\_SetPrivate a lot (different call stacks, though): TB20989667, TB20989639, TB20989449
Once under ActiveXConstructor (TB20987029), similar to Martijn's [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate").
Have not been able to reproduce with a debug build. I get a single "NATIVE:window" line added each time I press the button, and on the console "An error occurred updating the cmd\_copy command". Otherwise nothing.

It's not for the ActiveX crash, I just tested that. Not sure what it is.

The bonsai link doesn't go back far enough, just misses Igor's 3:50 check-in for [bug 330692](/show_bug.cgi?id=330692 "RESOLVED FIXED - GC_MARK_DEBUG: using GC_MARK, not JS_MarkGCThing internally") ("GC\_MARK\_DEBUG: using GC\_MARK, not JS\_MarkGCThing internally").

I've checked that by building a 2006-03-23 build and manually applying the patch from that bug.
That means that the regression range in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate") is not relevant for this bug :(

Why do you say that? The stacks from [bug 330900](/show_bug.cgi?id=330900 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsCrypto::GenerateCRMFRequest reads past end of array when given 2 args") were different from this bug, and in addition the current 1.8/1.8.0 branches also have the 330900 fix but still crash on the first testcase here. I've not been able to reproduce this crash with any debug build.
I confirm your regression range in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate") (2006-03-23-05 broken, 2006-03-24-05 fixed) but my money's still on Igor's GC patch.

I don't crash with 1.8/1.8.0 branches (only very sporadically). When I add && e.indexOf('CRMFRequest') == -1 to the testcase on the relevant spots, then I don't crash anymore with a 2006-03-23 trunk build.

The stack traces shows
JS\_SetPrivate [c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Mozilla1.8.0-Release/WINNT\_5.2\_Depend/mozilla/js/src/jsapi.c, line 2164]
js\_DefineFunction [c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Mozilla1.8.0-Release/WINNT\_5.2\_Depend/mozilla/js/src/jsfun.c, line 2125]
JS\_InitClass [c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Mozilla1.8.0-Release/WINNT\_5.2\_Depend/mozilla/js/src/jsapi.c, line 2045]
but js\_DefineFunction does not call JS\_SetPrivate directly, so the stack traces are not complete. Why it is so?

This fixes the problem in my 1.8.0.5 builds (debug and optimized). Reproducing the original crash in the debug build was iffy, but optimized was a consistent crasher (despite the occassional need to create new profiles, or delete the prefs.js file) and it's fixed now.

This JS\_ClearNewbornRoots hazard arose due to the null-script branch callback case, added for [bug 203278](/show_bug.cgi?id=203278 "VERIFIED FIXED - Spidermonkey 1.5 rc5 crashes during gc on my evil test case [@ js_MarkGCThing][@ js_Mark]"). But it exists also in theory due to the JSGC\_END mode GC-callback, used by Venkman and other modules.

v.fixed on 1.8.0 branch with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5, no crash with testcase. I was able to reliably crash with rc3 with the following steps:
1. launch with profile manager flag (-P)
2. create new profile
3. go to this bug, login to bugzilla
4. open testcase and click button
5. boom!
I crashed about 5-6 times in a row with the previous build (rc3), but have not been able to reproduce with latest rc4 build after about 15 tries (same basic steps above with a few variations thrown in).Keywords: [fixed1.8.0.5](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.8.0.5&resolution=---) â [verified1.8.0.5](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.8.0.5&resolution=---)

In Firefox 1.0.8 this particular testcase crashes on [bug 330900](/show_bug.cgi?id=330900 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsCrypto::GenerateCRMFRequest reads past end of array when given 2 args") instead. Once that's fixed on that branch this should be retested. It may or may not crash due to the timing issues involved.Flags: blocking1.7.14?Flags: blocking-aviary1.0.9?

Unfortunately, this bug does exist for 1.7.x and 1.0.x.
Dan, are you sure this was introduced with fix for [bug #203278](/show_bug.cgi?id=203278 "VERIFIED FIXED - Spidermonkey 1.5 rc5 crashes during gc on my evil test case [@ js_MarkGCThing][@ js_Mark]") ? I have not backported that, nevertheless \*all\* testcases do apply, so probably it was a different fix that triggered this. Any idea?

Did anyone verify this on Linux? Our QA seems to suggest that this is still not fixed on Linux... Will try to get more details.

At least backporting the branches fix attached did not help for 1.0.x ... so probably its really not fixed for linux.

Do you have backtraces of any crashes you see? The testcase for this bug is \*extremely\* generic, and it's possible that fixing this bug is exposing another bug.

So I went and had a look at the testing boxes, and it appears to not be a crash anymore. It's simply an exit(1) which is an improvement, but we should still get it to work properly. Anyway, here's the strace output.

If I'm reading the strace correctly, it seems that X becomes unhappy with us for whatever reason (the end of the log is opening XErrorDB and writing out something about 'Gecko') and kills us. I think that deserves its own bug.

[Backtrace 1.0.x (without patch)](attachment.cgi?id=231138) (obsolete)
â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=231138&action=edit)

This is a backtrace for 1.0.8 without the backported patch.
Further there was no patch for [bug 203278](/show_bug.cgi?id=203278 "VERIFIED FIXED - Spidermonkey 1.5 rc5 crashes during gc on my evil test case [@ js_MarkGCThing][@ js_Mark]") applied - see [comment #44](/show_bug.cgi?id=344759#c44 "RESOLVED FIXED - EIP hijack in FF 1.5.0.5 -- crash [@ 0x20202113] called by JS_SetPrivate")

The backtrace looks similar.

The backtrace looks similar to what? That looks like a very different problem, presumably fixed by some other bug on the trunk (and probably on the 1.8 branch). This particular crash is actually controlled, it will assert (abort in debug builds, and return false, silently halting the script's execution).

I meant similar to the backtrace from a build without the patch from [bug 330900](/show_bug.cgi?id=330900 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsCrypto::GenerateCRMFRequest reads past end of array when given 2 args").

Fine, that's good enough for me I guess.

# Mozilla SeaMonkey: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200608-02**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla SeaMonkey.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/seamonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3** |

### Background

The Mozilla SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as "Mozilla Application Suite".

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files.
* Developers in the Mozilla community
  looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
  Mozilla clients, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code by
  a remote attacker.
* "shutdown" reports that cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
  XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
  appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
  navigated to the target site.
* "shutdown" reports that scripts
  granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
  equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
  allowed to "read" into a privileged context.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4"
  reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could serve a
  PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by setting
  the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on a
  privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
  parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
  (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined by
  script (also ECMA-specified behavior).
* Igor Bukanov and
  shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
  could delete a temporary object that was in active use.
* Georgi
  Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long strings in
  the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String objects as well
  as string function arguments.
* H. D. Moore reported a testcase
  that was able to trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage
  collection deleted a temporary variable still being used in the
  creation of a new Function object.
* A malicious page can hijack
  native DOM methods on a document object in another domain, which will
  run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.
* Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
  to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
  happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer
  object.
* An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero
  Day Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
  properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.
* Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away.

### Impact

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.3"
```

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200608-04**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla Thunderbird.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

### Background

The Mozilla Thunderbird mail client is a redesign of the Mozilla Mail
component. The goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone mail
application using XUL (XML User Interface Language).

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URLss could be made to
  reference remote files.
* Developers in the Mozilla community
  looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
  Mozilla clients.
* "shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
  XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
  appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
  navigated to the target site.
* "shutdown" reports that scripts
  granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
  equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
  allowed to "read" into a privileged context.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4"
  discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a parent object created
  using the standard Object() constructor (ECMA-specified behavior) and
  that this constructor can be redefined by script (also ECMA-specified
  behavior).
* Igor Bukanov and shutdown found additional places
  where an untimely garbage collection could delete a temporary object
  that was in active use.
* Georgi Guninski found potential
  integer overflow issues with long strings in the toSource() methods of
  the Object, Array and String objects as well as string function
  arguments.
* H. D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to
  trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a
  temporary variable still being used in the creation of a new Function
  object.
* A malicious page can hijack native DOM methods on a
  document object in another domain, which will run the attacker's script
  when called by the victim page.
* Secunia Research has
  discovered a vulnerability which is caused due to an memory corruption
  error within the handling of simultaneously happening XPCOM events.
  This leads to use of a deleted timer object.

### Impact

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.5"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.5"
```

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla
package are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Seamonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This
update deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in
favor of the supported Seamonkey Suite.

This update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,
CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,
CVE-2006-3812)

Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey.
(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,
CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

Two flaws were found in the way Seamonkey-mail displayed malformed
inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing
a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the
user running Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed
Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web
page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer
could miss due to a malformed "script" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack
or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).
(CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

A form file upload flaw was found in the way Seamonkey handled javascript
input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local
file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Seamonkey called the
crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the
browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return
specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy
restrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)

A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A
malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was
called. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible
to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Seamonkey version 1.0.3 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Multilib systems may experience difficulty if trying to specify the package
by name to the Update Agent via a command line argument. This can be
solved by executing the following commands:

up2date seamonkey; up2date seamonkey-nss seamonkey-nspr

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200608-03**

The Mozilla Foundation has reported numerous security vulnerabilities
related to Mozilla Firefox.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.5** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a redesign of the Mozilla Navigator component. The
goal is to produce a cross-platform stand-alone browser application.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Benjamin Smedberg discovered that chrome URL's could be made to
  reference remote files.
* Developers in the Mozilla community
  looked for and fixed several crash bugs to improve the stability of
  Mozilla clients.
* "shutdown" reports that cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attacks could be performed using the construct
  XPCNativeWrapper(window).Function(...), which created a function that
  appeared to belong to the window in question even after it had been
  navigated to the target site.
* "shutdown" reports that scripts
  granting the UniversalBrowserRead privilege can leverage that into the
  equivalent of the far more powerful UniversalXPConnect since they are
  allowed to "read" into a privileged context.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4"
  reports that A malicious Proxy AutoConfig (PAC) server could serve a
  PAC script that can execute code with elevated privileges by setting
  the required FindProxyForURL function to the eval method on a
  privileged object that leaked into the PAC sandbox.
* "moz\_bug\_r\_a4" discovered that Named JavaScript functions have a
  parent object created using the standard Object() constructor
  (ECMA-specified behavior) and that this constructor can be redefined by
  script (also ECMA-specified behavior).
* Igor Bukanov and
  shutdown found additional places where an untimely garbage collection
  could delete a temporary object that was in active use.
* Georgi
  Guninski found potential integer overflow issues with long strings in
  the toSource() methods of the Object, Array and String objects as well
  as string function arguments.
* H. D. Moore reported a testcase
  that was able to trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage
  collection deleted a temporary variable still being used in the
  creation of a new Function object.
* A malicious page can hijack
  native DOM methods on a document object in another domain, which will
  run the attacker's script when called by the victim page.
* Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability which is caused due
  to an memory corruption error within the handling of simultaneously
  happening XPCOM events. This leads to use of a deleted timer
  object.
* An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero
  Day Initiative showed that when used in a web page Java would reference
  properties of the window.navigator object as it started up.
* Thilo Girmann discovered that in certain circumstances a JavaScript
  reference to a frame or window was not properly cleared when the
  referenced content went away.

### Impact

A user can be enticed to open specially crafted URLs, visit webpages
containing malicious JavaScript or execute a specially crafted script.
These events could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, or the
installation of malware on the user's computer.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.5"
```

Users of the binary package should upgrade as well:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.5"
```
