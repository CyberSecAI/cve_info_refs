{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Seitenname' parameter within the 'add.php' script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session within the context of the affected website. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to 'add.php' with a malicious value in the 'Seitenname' parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a request to the affected application. No authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_product": {
    "name": "Fire-Mouse TopList",
    "version": "1.1 and prior"
  },
  "additional_notes": "The advisory mentions that 'register_globals' must be 'On' for the exploit to work. It also provides code examples using 'htmlspecialchars()' or 'htmlentities()' php-functions to sanitize the input as a solution. CVSS base score of 2.6 is reported, which seems low considering the XSS vulnerability."
