  "CVE-2006-3445": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Agent handles specially crafted .ACF files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of specially crafted .ACF files by Microsoft Agent, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Improper handling of specially crafted files"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a webpage containing malicious .ACF files, or compromise a legitimate website to host the files, and then persuade a user to visit the site. Clicking a link in a message (email, IM etc.) may also redirect a user to the malicious website.  ",
      "Exploitation via specially crafted .ACF file"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host or inject a webpage containing a malicious .ACF file. They also need to persuade the user to visit the malicious webpage. Basic web hosting and social engineering capabilities are required. No special or privileged access is required from the user."
