{
  "CVE-2006-3084": {
    "Description": "The MIT krb 5 ftpd and ksu programs contain multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are dependent on the host operating system's implementation of the seteuid() system call and result when seteuid() can fail due to resource exhaustion while changing to an unprivileged user ID. Some implementations of seteuid() do not expose the vulnerability. Specifically, unchecked calls to seteuid() in ftpd may allow a local privilege escalation leading to reading, writing, or creating files as root, and unchecked calls to seteuid() in the ksu program may allow a local privilege escalation resulting in filling a file with null bytes as root and then deleting it (the kdestroy operation).",
    "Root cause": "Unchecked return values of seteuid() system calls in ftpd and ksu programs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can gain root privileges and execute arbitrary code or manipulate files with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation of the ftpd or ksu programs.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is required and the ability to execute the vulnerable applications. The attacker needs to be authenticated"
