How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2006-001
Original release: 2006-08-08
Last update: 2006-08-16
Topic: multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities
Severity: serious
SUMMARY
=======
[patch corrected since original release]
In certain application programs packaged in the MIT Kerberos 5 source
distribution, calls to setuid() and seteuid() are not always checked
for success. A local user could exploit one of these vulnerabilities
to result in privilege escalation. No exploit code is known to exist
at this time. It is believed that the primary risk is to Linux
systems, due to the behavior of their implementation of the setuid()
and seteuid() system calls.
IMPACT
======
Actual impact depends on implementation details within a specific
operating system. Vulnerabilities result when the OS implementations
of setuid() or seteuid() can fail due to resource exhaustion when
changing to an unprivileged user ID. We believe that only unchecked
calls to setuid(), and not calls to seteuid(), are vulnerable on
Linux.
On AIX, Kerberos applications provided by IBM are not vulnerable. If,
in place of or in addition to IBM-provided Kerberos applications, MIT
krb5 code is installed on an AIX system, the affected MIT krb5
applications are vulnerable to the setuid() issues listed in
CVE-2006-3083. We believe that no other operating systems are
affected.
[CVE-2006-3083, VU#580124] The following vulnerabilities may result
from unchecked calls to setuid(), and are believed to only exist on
Linux and AIX:
\* Unchecked calls to setuid() in krshd may allow a local privilege
escalation leading to execution of programs as root.
\* Unchecked calls to setuid() in the v4rcp may allow a local privilege
escalation leading to reading, writing, or creating files as root.
v4rcp is the remote end of a krb4-authenticated rcp operation, but
may be executed directly by an attacker, as it is a setuid program.
[CVE-2006-3084, VU#401660] The following vulnerabilities may result
from unchecked calls to seteuid(). These vulnerabilities are not yet
known to exist on any operating system:
\* Unchecked calls to seteuid() in ftpd may allow a local privilege
escalation leading to reading, writing, or creating files as root.
\* Unchecked calls to seteuid() in the ksu program may allow a local
privilege escalation resulting in filling a file with null bytes as
root and then deleting it (the "kdestroy" operation).
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* The above-listed programs are vulnerable in all releases of MIT
krb5, up to and including krb5-1.5. The krb5-1.5.1 and krb5-1.4.4
releases will contain fixes for these problems.
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.5.1 and krb5-1.4.4 releases will include fixes
for these vulnerabilities.
\* Disable krshd and ftpd, and remove the setuid bit from the ksu
binary and the v4rcp binary.
\* For the krb5-1.5 release, apply the patch at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-001-patch\_1.5.txt
A PGP-signed version of this patch is at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-001-patch\_1.5.txt.asc
This patch was generated against the krb5-1.5 release, and may apply
to earlier releases with some fuzz. The patch also updates some
calls to other setuid-like system calls on less-common operating
systems, though these calls are less likely to be vulnerable.
Note that the original version of this patch contained an error in
the patch to ksu which introduced a minor bug; this erroneous ksu
patch may be identified by diff header
"\*\*\* clients/ksu/main.c (revision 18419)"
\* For the krb5-1.4.3 release, apply the patch at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-001-patch\_1.4.3.txt
A PGP-signed version of this patch is at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2006-001-patch\_1.4.3.txt
This patch was generated against the krb5-1.4.3 release, and may apply
to earlier releases with some fuzz. The patch also updates some
calls to other setuid-like system calls on less-common operating
systems, though these calls are less likely to be vulnerable.
Note that the original version of this patch contained an error in
the patch to ksu which introduced a minor bug; this erroneous ksu
patch may be identified by diff header
"\*\*\* clients/ksu/main.c (revision 18419)"

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to Michael Calmer and Marcus Meissner at SUSE for reporting
this problem.
Thanks to Shiva Persaud at IBM for information on AIX.
Thanks to Sachin Punadikar for reporting the error in the ksu patch.
DETAILS
=======
Typically, setuid(), seteuid(), and similar system calls cannot fail
except in cases of inadequate privilege or system misconfiguration.
Unlike other operating systems, Linux and AIX system calls which
change the real user ID can fail if the change would cause the target
user ID to exceed its quota of allowed processes. A local attacker
may be able to exhaust a process quota in a way which artificially
creates such a failure condition. This may result in privilege
escalation when a program making an unchecked call to one of these
system calls expects to continue execution with reduced privilege
following the affected call, but instead continues to run as a
privileged user.
Specific places where various system calls are not checked include:
appl/bsd/krcp.c: setreuid (uncompiled code), setuid (irrelevant
because not installed setuid)
appl/bsd/krshd.c: setuid
appl/bsd/krsh.c: setuid (irrelevant because not installed setuid)
appl/bsd/v4rcp.c: setuid
appl/gssftp/ftpd/ftpd.c: seteuid
client/ksu/main.c: seteuid
lib/krb4/kuserok.c: seteuid (but likely irrelevant)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## MIT Kerberos (krb5) ftpd and ksu do not properly validate seteuid() calls

#### Vulnerability Note VU#401660

Original Release Date: 2006-08-15 | Last Revised: 2006-08-16

---

### Overview

Privilege escalation vulnerabilities in MIT krb5 ftpd and ksu may allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| The MIT krb 5 ftpd and ksu programs contain multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities are dependent on the host operating system's implementation of the seteuid() system call and result when seteuid() can fail due to resource exhaustion while changing to an unprivileged user ID. Some implementations of seteuid() do not expose the vulnerability.From MIT krb5 Security Advisory [2006-001](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-001-setuid.txt):*The following vulnerabilities may result from unchecked calls to seteuid(). These vulnerabilities are not yet known to exist on any operating system:*     + *Unchecked calls to seteuid() in ftpd may allow a local privilege escalation leading to reading, writing, or creating files as root.*    + *Unchecked calls to seteuid() in the ksu program may allow a local privilege escalation resulting in filling a file with null bytes as root and then deleting it (the "kdestroy" operation).* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**The MIT Kerberos team has released an [update](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-001-setuid.txt) to address these issues. See the Systems Affected section of this document for information about specific vendors. Users who compile Kerberos from the original source distribution should see [MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2006-00](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-001-setuid.txt)1 for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable vulnerable programs**From MIT krb5 Security Advisory [2006-001](http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2006-001-setuid.txt): "Disable krshd and ftpd, and remove the setuid bit from the ksu binary and the v4rcp binary." |

| [Description](#c0)  Benjamin Ritcey    2002-01-12 21:40:08 UTC  ``` Attached is an ebuild for EtherApe, a GTK+ graphical network monitor.  From their web page:    "EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. Color coded protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network."  It relies on GTK+, libpcap and libglade.  The web page says it needs Gnome, but GTK+ should be enough...   This pretty clearly belongs in net-analyzer.  It's my first ebuild, so be merciful =)  ebuild generated by John Stalker's very cool mkebuild script (please make that part of the distro). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Benjamin Ritcey    2002-01-12 21:41:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 51](attachment.cgi?id=51 "etherape-0.8.2.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=51&action=edit "etherape-0.8.2.ebuild")] etherape-0.8.2.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bruce A. Locke    2002-01-26 03:21:51 UTC  ```  Ooops...  I just made an etherape ebuild and committed it a few minutes ago.  Please see my ebuild as I don't think the autogenerated one is correct at all. :)  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-26 08:17:26 UTC  ``` blocke what do you mean? I assign this issue to you and you can take the correct descision what to do.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Bruce A. Locke    2002-01-26 14:37:33 UTC  ```  I had already committed my own version of the ebuild before noticing this bug.  Just wanted to point out that the kind person who submitted an ebuild might want to look at it as the submitted ebuild could have used some improvement :)  Closing Bug. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Heimdal: Multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-21**

Certain Heimdal components, ftpd and rcp, are vulnerable to a local
privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/heimdal** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.7.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7.2-r3** |

### Background

Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5.

### Description

The ftpd and rcp applications provided by Heimdal fail to check the
return value of calls to seteuid().

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Heimdal users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/heimdal-0.7.2-r3"
```

# USN-334-1: krb5 vulnerabilities

16 August 2006

krb5 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Michael Calmer and Marcus Meissner discovered that several krb5 tools

did not check the return values from setuid() system calls. On systems

that have configured user process limits, it may be possible for an

attacker to cause setuid() to fail via resource starvation. In that

situation, the tools will not reduce their privilege levels, and will

continue operation as the root user.

By default, Ubuntu does not ship with user process limits.

Please note that these packages are not officially supported by Ubuntu

(they are in the 'universe' component of the archive).

### Reduce your security exposure

* krb5-rsh-server
  -
  1.3.6-4ubuntu0.1
* krb5-ftpd
  -
  1.3.6-4ubuntu0.1
* krb5-user
  -
  1.3.6-4ubuntu0.1

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* krb5-clients
  -
  1.3.6-1ubuntu0.2

* krb5-ftpd
  -
  1.3.6-1ubuntu0.2
* krb5-user
  -
  1.3.6-1ubuntu0.2

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple local privilege escalation vulnerabilities — GLSA **200608-15**

Some applications shipped with MIT Kerberos 5 are vulnerable to local
privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.3-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.3-r3** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for
client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.

### Description

Unchecked calls to setuid() in krshd and v4rcp, as well as unchecked
calls to seteuid() in kftpd and in ksu, have been found in the MIT
Kerberos 5 program suite and may lead to a local root privilege
escalation.

### Impact

A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.4.3-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1146-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
August 9th, 2006                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-3083 CVE-2006-3084
CERT advisories: VU#580124 VU#401660

In certain application programs packaged in the MIT Kerberos 5 source
distribution, calls to setuid() and seteuid() are not always checked
for success and which may fail with some PAM configurations.  A local
user could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to result in privilege
escalation.  No exploit code is known to exist at this time.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.3-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
