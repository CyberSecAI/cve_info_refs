How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

By accessing or downloading any Materials subject to any such restrictions and regulations, you represent and warrant that (a) you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list, and (b) you are not located in or a national or resident of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria which list is subject to update as required from time to time by law and regulation, or (c) you are not restricted from receiving U.S. or U.K. goods; and that you will comply with all applicable U.S. and U.K. export laws and host country import laws.

#### Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Micro Focus Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from violation of these Website Terms of Use by You or anyone using Your account. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by You and, in such case, You agree to cooperate with Our defense of such claim.

#### Electronic Communications

When You visit Our Website or send e-mails to Us, You are communicating with Us electronically. We may respond to You by e-mail or by posting notices on Our Website. You agree that all such notices, disclosures, and other communications that We provide to You electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

#### Entire Agreement

These Website Terms of Use, together with any additional terms to which You agree when using particular elements of Our Website, constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement as between You and Us with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between You and We with respect to the same. The Micro Focus Parties are third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Website Terms of Use that reference them.

#### Governing Law and Venue

These Website Terms of Use and disputes arising hereunder will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. You and We irrevocably and unconditionally (i) consent to venue in the State of Delaware and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Delaware and (ii) waive any claims of forum non conveniens with respect to such venue. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to these Website Terms of Use.

#### Dispute Resolution

The procedures set forth in this Article will apply to any dispute, controversy or claim, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or relating hereto ("Dispute") and will be the sole and exclusive procedures in connection with any such Dispute. You and We irrevocably waive any right to commence any action in or before any governmental authority, except as expressly provided in these Website Terms of Use, and except to the extent provided under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, in the case of judicial review of arbitration results or awards. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED, YOU AND WE IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ANY TRIAL IN A COURT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY DISPUTE.

Except as provided below, all Disputes shall be resolved through mandatory and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall take place in Santa Clara County, State of California before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude Us from seeking equitable remedies as set forth below. The prevailing party in any legal proceeding shall recover its expenses in connection therewith, including reasonable attorney's fees. Except as required by applicable Law, the existence, content and result of all Dispute resolution proceedings will be confidential and will not be disclosed (other than to the extent required to enforce any agreement or award). You and We will each request that the arbitrator comply with such confidentiality requirement.

You acknowledge that, in the event You breach (or attempt or threaten to breach) Your obligations regarding Our intellectual property, We may be irreparably harmed and may proceed immediately to seek equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of competent jurisdiction should find that You have breached (or attempted or threatened to breach) any such obligations, You agree that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, You will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling Your performance and restraining You from any further breaches (or attempted or threatened breaches).

#### Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer

Our Websites contain forward-looking statements that are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties associated with, among other items, the changing economic and business conditions in the countries, sectors and business segments in which We operate. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, e.g., numerous assumptions regarding Our present and future business strategies and the environments in which We operate. They are not guarantees and may prove inaccurate. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Please do not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by any applicable laws or regulations.

#### Miscellaneous

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Website Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Website Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, You nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Website Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. The section titles in these Website Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Website Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of Your use of Our Website. These Website Terms of Use will be interpreted without application of any strict construction in favor of or against You or Us. These Website Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be assigned by Us without restriction.
