  "CVE-2006-3740": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in the CID font parser.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Integer overflows, potentially leading to buffer overflows.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the X server (typically root). A local user could also exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges. Remote attackers can also exploit this by enticing a user to load a malicious font file.",
       "Attack vectors": "Loading a malicious font file. Remote attack via enticing a user to load a malicious font, local attack via a local user loading the font.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For remote attacks, the ability to entice a user to load the malicious font file. For local attacks, the ability to load font files on the target system."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow vulnerabilities in XFree86 server when processing CID fonts.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Integer overflows when parsing CID font files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Possible execution of arbitrary code as the root user, denial of service (crash) of the X.org server.",
       "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted CID font file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authorized user could possibly execute arbitrary code as root or crash the X server."
