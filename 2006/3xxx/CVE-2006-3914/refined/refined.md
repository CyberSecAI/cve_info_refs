Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a persistent/stored/second-order cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the testing functionality of Blackboard Academic Suite 6.2.23.
*   The application attempts to defend against XSS by using client-side JavaScript to remove potentially malicious JavaScript code entered into test questions. However, this client-side validation can be bypassed by disabling JavaScript in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be stored in the database through the essay question input field.
*   **Client-Side Validation:** The application relies on client-side JavaScript for input sanitization, which can be easily bypassed by disabling JavaScript.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:**  The vulnerability exists because the application does not perform proper input sanitization on the server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a low-privileged user account (e.g., student) can escalate their privileges within a Blackboard course or even gain system-wide administrative privileges by stealing session cookies.
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** The injected JavaScript code is executed in the victim's browser within the security context of the Blackboard website. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Potential for Remote Exploitation:** An additional attack opportunity is possible if a remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in the target user's JavaScript interpreter.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Test Creation:** An attacker, acting as an instructor, creates a test with an essay question.
*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker, acting as a student, disables JavaScript in their browser, and injects malicious JavaScript code into the response field of the essay question.
*   **Viewing Attempt Details:** When a higher-privileged user (e.g., instructor) views the attempt details, the stored malicious JavaScript code executes in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Account:** The attacker needs a user account with student-level access.
*   **Course Instructor Role (Initial Setup):** The attacker needs a role that allows creating tests, this may be an existing compromised instructor account.
*   **Ability to Disable JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to disable JavaScript in their browser while submitting the malicious content.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs a higher-privileged user (e.g., instructor) to view the test attempt details where the malicious script executes.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested using Mozilla Firefox.
*   The vendor was aware of the issue for at least two and one-half months prior to the report.
*   No known solution was provided at the time of the report.
