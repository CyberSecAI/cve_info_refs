| [Description](#c0)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-13 16:51:22 UTC  ``` Shoutcast server 1.9.5 allows any remote attacker who can reach the server's port to read arbitrary files on the machine. Sample request can be obtained using the following command:  echo -e "GET /content/%2E./.%2E/%2E%2E/etc/shadow%00.mp3\n"  which, when piped through netcat to the listening Shoutcast server, should show the contents of /etc/shadow file. The complete advisory (written for a different target audience, though; so it contains some uninteresting details) can be found at <http://people.ksp.sk/~goober/advisory/001-shoutcast.html>  The vendor (Nullsoft) has NOT been contacted yet, for I failed to find any security contact and didn't feel very much like posting this information to their public forums. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-14 02:56:02 UTC  ``` Jeremy you touched this one before Chris White. Could you please advise?  @Peter is link public? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-14 04:09:23 UTC  ``` No, the link is not public and will not become public until the vulnerability is resolved. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-16 12:57:01 UTC  ``` Well, this is a binary package.  We can't do anything until upstream releases a new version.  The workarounds are valid, but we can't really force that on users as I'm sure many won't want to not run it in a chroot jail.  As for executing as a unpriv user, that's a good idea in general, and I don't see why that wasn't the case already.  We need to notify upstream.  I'd look for personal contact info for the developers.  Additionally, I believe NullSoft is still owned by AOL, so you might be able to contact AOL's security team for the contact information. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-22 15:32:25 UTC  ``` The upstream released a new version for Linux today. Preliminary tests show that the original vulnerability is no longer present, but the changes introduced a new, very similar one. Thus, the actual version (1.9.6) is NOT safe yet. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-22 15:42:20 UTC  ``` Peter, is upstream informed that it's still flawed? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-22 15:57:47 UTC  ``` Yes, the vendor has been notified a few minutes ago. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-23 13:00:33 UTC  ``` Okay, upstream released 1.9.7 today, vulnerabilities (original one + the new ones caused by the first fix) are apparently fixed. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-24 07:34:19 UTC  ``` eradicator, please bump. Shoutcast mentioned the security issues on their homepage and their board, so this is public. Peter, may we open this bug to the public, too? ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Peter Kosinar    2006-06-24 07:48:53 UTC  ``` As the fixed version is available, I see no problems with opening it. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-24 22:26:25 UTC  ``` I am on vacation in Hawaii and don't have access to my box to test the new software. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Jeremy Huddleston (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-24 22:42:41 UTC  ``` I am on vacation in Hawaii and don't have access to my box to test the new software.  sound: Can someone please bump this and test it? ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-25 06:49:45 UTC  ``` amd64 and x86 please test and mark stable, but beware: i haven't slept for 30h ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-28 13:48:27 UTC  ``` Tested in x86 and works pretty fine, i'm listening right now my music. Should be marked as stable. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-29 12:26:44 UTC  ``` Stable on amd64/x86... thanks for testing... ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-30 08:47:09 UTC  ``` This one is ready for GLSA decision. ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-30 08:55:20 UTC  ``` mhh, weak yes, but i wouldn't mind a no ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-30 08:55:46 UTC  ``` mhh, weak yes, but i wouldn't mind a no ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Wolf Giesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-30 09:17:56 UTC  ``` Kinda silly, but YES. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-30 09:19:26 UTC  ``` Voting yes, so let's have a GLSA more. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-07-09 10:37:19 UTC  ``` GLSA 200607-05 ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# SHOUTcast server: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200607-05**

The SHOUTcast server is vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability and
multiple XSS vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/shoutcast-server-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.9.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.9.7** |

### Background

SHOUTcast server is a streaming audio server.

### Description

The SHOUTcast server is vulnerable to a file disclosure when the server
receives a specially crafted GET request. Furthermore it also fails to
sanitize the input passed to the "Description", "URL", "Genre", "AIM",
and "ICQ" fields.

### Impact

By sending a specially crafted GET request to the SHOUTcast server, the
attacker can read any file that can be read by the SHOUTcast process.
Furthermore it is possible that various request variables could also be
exploited to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's
browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SHOUTcast server users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/shoutcast-server-bin-1.9.7"
```
