The provided content relates to CVE-2006-3089.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities in PhpMyFactures 1.0:**

*   **Multiple Vulnerabilities:** The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including Full Path Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and SQL Injection.

*   **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   Several files reveal the full server path, potentially aiding attackers in further exploitation.
    *   Affected files include `verif.php`, `inc/footer.php`, and `remises/ajouter_remise.php`.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Multiple parameters in different files are vulnerable to XSS attacks.
    *   This includes both guest-accessible and admin-accessible pages.
    *   Examples: `inc/header.php?prefixe_dossier=`, `remises/ajouter_remise.php?msg=`, and `stocks/ajouter.php?msg=` etc.
    *   Attack vector: crafted URL parameters

*  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Several files and parameters are susceptible to SQL injection vulnerabilities,
    *   Affected parameters include `id_remise`, `id_taux`, `ref_produit`, `id_stock`, `id_pays`, `id_cat` and others.
    *   Attack vector: crafted URL parameters.
    *   Examples: `remises/index.php?action=delete&id_remise=1"`, `tva/index.php?action=delete&id_taux=1"`,  `stocks/index.php?action=delete&ref_produit=1"` etc.
    *   The identified SQLi vulnerabilities allow attackers to perform database operations such as DELETE, SELECT and INSERT.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Exposes server paths, potentially assisting in further attacks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to read, modify, or delete database data, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker requires remote access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** Understanding of the application's URL structure and parameter handling is beneficial for crafting exploits.
*   **Guest or Admin Access:** Some vulnerabilities are accessible to guests, while others require admin privileges.
