    "ID": "CVE-2006-3913",
     "Source": "aluigi.altervista.org_d696221b_20250125_163139.html",
    "Vulnerability": "A] memcpy crash in generic_handle_player_attribute_chunk B] invalid memory access in handle_unit_orders",
     "Root cause": "A] The length of the current chunk received is not verified, allowing an attacker to copy a large amount of data. Also, a large positive offset can bypass a check, allowing copying to malformed memory locations.\n B] The server function handle_unit_orders doesn't check the maximum size of the packet->length value, which should not be bigger than 2000 (MAX_LEN_ROUTE), allowing an attacker to use a larger value.",
     "Weaknesses": [
       "Missing length check",
       "Bypassable offset check",
       "Missing size check"
     ],
     "Impact": "A] Crash due to memcpy with large data, possible memory corruption. B] Invalid memory access leading to a crash.",
     "Attack vector": "Remote, versus server.",
     "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to send malformed data to the server. Requires modification of client source code to send the malformed data."
