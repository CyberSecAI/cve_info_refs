Debian Security Advisory DSA 1142-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
August 4th, 2006                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : freeciv
Vulnerability  : missing bouncary checks
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-3913
BugTraq ID     : 19117
Debian Bug     : 381378

Luigi Auriemma discovered missing boundary checks in freeciv, a clone
of the well known Civilisation game, which can be exploited by remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.1-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your freeciv package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
Freeciv is an open source clone of the well known Civilization game.
The game supports also online gaming through its own metaserver (which
can be seen on the web too) and GGZ (http://www.ggzgamingzone.org).
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------------------------------
A] memcpy crash in generic\_handle\_player\_attribute\_chunk
--------------------------------------------------------
handle\_player\_attribute\_chunk (which points to
generic\_handle\_player\_attribute\_chunk) is a function used by both
client and server when a PACKET\_PLAYER\_ATTRIBUTE\_CHUNK packet is
received.
The function acts like a reassembler of data for an allocated buffer
which can have a size of max 262144 bytes.
Exist two problems in this function:
- the length of the current chunk received (chunk\_length) is not
verified so using a negative value an attacker can bypass the initial
check and can copy a huge amount of data ((unsigned)chunk\_length) in
the data buffer with the subsequent crash
- the check "chunk->offset + chunk->chunk\_length > chunk->total\_length"
can be bypassed using a very big positive offset like 0x7fffffff
which will allow the copying of data from our packet to the memory
located at the malformed offset of the allocated buffer.
Doesn't seem possible to execute malicious code with this bug since
the destination memory is usually invalid
From common/packets.c:
void generic\_handle\_player\_attribute\_chunk(struct player \*pplayer,
const struct
packet\_player\_attribute\_chunk
\*chunk)
{
freelog(LOG\_DEBUG, "received attribute chunk %d/%d %d", chunk->offset,
chunk->total\_length, chunk->chunk\_length);
if (chunk->total\_length < 0
|| chunk->total\_length >= MAX\_ATTRIBUTE\_BLOCK
|| chunk->offset < 0
|| chunk->offset + chunk->chunk\_length > chunk->total\_length
|| (chunk->offset != 0
&& chunk->total\_length != pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.length)) {
/\* wrong attribute data \*/
if (pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data) {
free(pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data);
pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data = NULL;
}
pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.length = 0;
freelog(LOG\_ERROR, "Received wrong attribute chunk");
return;
}
/\* first one in a row \*/
if (chunk->offset == 0) {
if (pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data) {
free(pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data);
pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data = NULL;
}
pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data = fc\_malloc(chunk->total\_length);
pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.length = chunk->total\_length;
}
memcpy((char \*) (pplayer->attribute\_block\_buffer.data) + chunk->offset,
chunk->data, chunk->chunk\_length);
...
----------------------------------------------
B] invalid memory access in handle\_unit\_orders
----------------------------------------------
The server's function handle\_unit\_orders doesn't check the maximum
size of the packet->length value which should not be bigger than 2000
(MAX\_LEN\_ROUTE) while is possible for an attacker to use any positive
number.
The crash could require different tries (usually 3) before happening.
From server/unithand.c:
void handle\_unit\_orders(struct player \*pplayer,
struct packet\_unit\_orders \*packet)
{
struct unit \*punit = player\_find\_unit\_by\_id(pplayer, packet->unit\_id);
struct tile \*src\_tile = map\_pos\_to\_tile(packet->src\_x, packet->src\_y);
int i;
if (!punit || packet->length < 0 || punit->activity != ACTIVITY\_IDLE) {
return;
}
if (src\_tile != punit->tile) {
/\* Failed sanity check. Usually this happens if the orders were sent
\* in the previous turn, and the client thought the unit was in a
\* different position than it's actually in. The easy solution is to
\* discard the packet. We don't send an error message to the client
\* here (though maybe we should?). \*/
return;
}
for (i = 0; i < packet->length; i++) {
...
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
No proof-of-concept available, you must modify the source code of the
client for forcing the sending of the malformed data.
#######################################################################
======
4) Fix
======
The bugs have been fixed in the SVN of the 16 Jul 2006

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
