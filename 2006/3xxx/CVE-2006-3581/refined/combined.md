===============
1) Introduction
===============
AdPlug is an open source library used for playing many Adlib file
formats.
It also includes some programs and plugins for Winamp and XMMS.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
The library is affected by various heap and stack overflow
vulnerabilities.
As intuitable by the types of bugs almost all the unpacking
instructions don't verify the size of the destination buffers and trust
in the values provided by the same files which are used for allocating
the needed buffers (except in the CFF files where it has a fixed size).
The following are the parts of bugged code:
----------------------------------------------
A] heap overflow in the unpacking of CFF files
----------------------------------------------
From cff.cpp:
bool CcffLoader::load(const std::string &filename, const CFileProvider &fp)
...
f->readString(header.id, 16);
header.version = f->readInt(1); header.size = f->readInt(2);
header.packed = f->readInt(1); f->readString((char \*)header.reserved, 12);
if (memcmp(header.id,"""\x1A\xDE\xE0",16))
{ fp.close(f); return false; }
unsigned char \*module = new unsigned char [0x10000];
// packed ?
if (header.packed)
{
cff\_unpacker \*unpacker = new cff\_unpacker;
unsigned char \*packed\_module = new unsigned char [header.size + 4];
memset(packed\_module,0,header.size + 4);
f->readString((char \*)packed\_module, header.size);
fp.close(f);
if (!unpacker->unpack(packed\_module,module))
...
----------------------------------------------
B] heap overflow in the unpacking of MTK files
----------------------------------------------
From mtk.cpp:
bool CmtkLoader::load(const std::string &filename, const CFileProvider &fp)
...
// read header
f->readString(header.id, 18);
header.crc = f->readInt(2);
header.size = f->readInt(2);
// file validation section
if(strncmp(header.id,"mpu401tr\x92kk\xeer@data",18))
{ fp.close(f); return false; }
// load section
cmpsize = fp.filesize(f) - 22;
cmp = new unsigned char[cmpsize];
org = new unsigned char[header.size];
for(i = 0; i < cmpsize; i++) cmp[i] = f->readInt(1);
fp.close(f);
while(cmpptr < cmpsize) { // decompress
...
----------------------------------------------
C] heap overflow in the unpacking of DMO files
----------------------------------------------
From dmo.cpp:
#define ARRAY\_AS\_WORD(a, i) ((a[i + 1] << 8) + a[i])
...
bool CdmoLoader::load(const std::string &filename, const CFileProvider &fp)
...
// get file size
long packed\_length = fp.filesize(f);
f->seek(0);
unsigned char \*packed\_module = new unsigned char [packed\_length];
// load file
f->readString((char \*)packed\_module, packed\_length);
fp.close(f);
// decrypt
unpacker->decrypt(packed\_module,packed\_length);
long unpacked\_length = 0x2000 \* ARRAY\_AS\_WORD(packed\_module, 12);
unsigned char \*module = new unsigned char [unpacked\_length];
// unpack
if (!unpacker->unpack(packed\_module+12,module))
...
-------------------------------
D] buffer-overflow in DTM files
-------------------------------
From dtm.cpp:
bool CdtmLoader::load(const std::string &filename, const CFileProvider &fp)
...
char bufstr[80];
for (i=0;i<16;i++)
{
// get line length
unsigned char bufstr\_length = f->readInt(1);
// read line
if (bufstr\_length)
{
f->readString(bufstr,bufstr\_length);
for (j=0;jseek(checkhead->ordnum, binio::Add);
for(i = 0; i < checkhead->insnum; i++)
insptr[i] = f->readInt(2);
for(i=0;iinsnum;i++) {
f->seek(insptr[i]\*16);
if(f->readInt(1) >= 2) {
adlibins = true;
break;
}
}
delete checkhead;
if(!adlibins) { fp.close(f); return false; }
}
// load section
f->seek(0); // rewind for load
load\_header(f, &header); // read header
for(i = 0; i < header.ordnum; i++) orders[i] = f->readInt(1); // read orders
for(i = 0; i < header.insnum; i++) insptr[i] = f->readInt(2); // instrument parapointers
for(i = 0; i < header.patnum; i++) pattptr[i] = f->readInt(2); // pattern parapointers
...
----------------------------------------------
F] heap overflow in the unpacking of U6M files
----------------------------------------------
destination.size is set but not used so there is no check on the real
size of the output buffer.
From u6m.cpp:
bool Cu6mPlayer::load(const std::string &filename, const CFileProvider &fp)
...
unsigned char pseudo\_header[6];
f->readString((char \*)pseudo\_header, 6);
decompressed\_filesize = pseudo\_header[0] + (pseudo\_header[1] << 8);
if (!( (pseudo\_header[2]==0) && (pseudo\_header[3]==0) &&
(pseudo\_header[4] + ((pseudo\_header[5] & 0x1)<<8) == 0x100) &&
(decompressed\_filesize > (filesize-4)) ))
{
fp.close(f);
return(false);
}
...
song\_data = new unsigned char[decompressed\_filesize];
unsigned char\* compressed\_song\_data = new unsigned char[filesize-4];
f->seek(4);
f->readString((char \*)compressed\_song\_data, filesize - 4);
fp.close(f);
// attempt to decompress the song data
// if unsuccessful, deallocate song\_data[] on the spot, and return(false)
data\_block source, destination;
source.size = filesize-4;
source.data = compressed\_song\_data;
destination.size = decompressed\_filesize;
destination.data = song\_data;
if (!lzw\_decompress(source,destination))
...
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
I have written a basic experimental proof-of-concept but for some
limitations (I don't know all the compression algorithms used) it
cannot test all the bugs.
Anyway it's not completed or optimized so please don't consider it a
real working code except for bugs 4 and 5.

# AdPlug: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200609-06**

Multiple heap and buffer overflows exist in AdPlug.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/adplug** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.1** |

### Background

AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, and hardware-independent AdLib sound
player library.

### Description

AdPlug is vulnerable to buffer and heap overflows when processing the
following types of files: CFF, MTK, DMO, U6M, DTM, and S3M.

### Impact

By enticing a user to load a specially crafted file, an attacker could
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running AdPlug.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All AdPlug users should update to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/adplug-2.0.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Audacious: Multiple heap and buffer overflows — GLSA **200607-13**

The adplug library included in Audacious is vulnerable to various overflows
that could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/audacious** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.0** |

### Background

Audacious is a media player that has been forked from Beep Media
Player.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma has found that the adplug library fails to verify the
size of the destination buffers in the unpacking instructions,
resulting in various possible heap and buffer overflows.

### Impact

An attacker can entice a user to load a specially crafted media file,
resulting in a crash or possible execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Audacious users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/audacious-1.1.0"
```
