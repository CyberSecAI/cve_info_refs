{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `header.php` file of CMS Faethon 1.3.2. The `$mainpath` variable, used to include other files, is not properly sanitized. If the `register_globals` and `allow_fopenurl` PHP settings are enabled, an attacker can inject a malicious URL to control the included file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
       "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL, specifically targeting the `mainpath` parameter in `header.php`, to include a remote file from a server they control.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a web server to host their malicious script and knowledge of the vulnerable CMS Faethon installation path. The PHP settings on the vulnerable server need to have `register_globals` and `allow_fopenurl` enabled."
