{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable within multiple Mambo/Joomla components. Specifically, components 'com_hashcash', 'HTMLArea3 addon - ImageManager', and 'Sitemap 2.0.0 for Mambo 4.5.1 CMS' are affected.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server, potentially leading to complete system compromise and unauthorized access.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component's PHP scripts (`server.php`, `config.inc.php`, or `sitemap.xml.php`). The request includes a malicious URL in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a web browser and must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the target server. The `register_globals` setting needs to be enabled on the server and `allow_fopenurl` setting needs to be on. The attacker also needs a web server to host the malicious PHP script."
