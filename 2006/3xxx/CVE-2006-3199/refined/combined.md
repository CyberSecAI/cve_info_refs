  I would like an option for the main window to resize when the sidebar slides out. I frequently use Aria and ChatGPT, and quite often, I need to follow directions in the AI responses. It becomes tedious to keep pulling the sidebar out to read the next line of instructions. A button/toggle on the sidebar would be nice to activate or deactivate this feature as needed.

  [@yaakhan](https://forums.opera.com/uid/540776) I really like Opera, but this issue still remains. It's easy to reproduce. Just launch and close opera a few times and you will see. It is terrible. I have 6 workspaces, with a lot of tab islands and I cannot afford to spend 30 minutes rebuilding them each time they vanish. I cannot understand how this cannot work fine. This is the only think that keeps me using Vivaldi instead Opera.

  So my Opera GX updates automatically and now the border and stuff is more blocky and I do not like it. I want to revert it to how it was before. Anyone know how?

  Being logged in to my YouTube account, I can't see the Notifications bell icon, to check for any replies to my Comments. I do see this in the YouTube app itself. Do I need to toggle some Setting in Opera?

  I was just curious enough to try it. I remember long ago when I installed Arch Linux. It was a new distro and not very popular at all back then, and had a small following. Anyway, most good things start out small.
