{
  "CVE-2006-3727": {
    "Description": "Eskolar CMS 0.9.0.0 is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection and admin login bypass.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL Injection vulnerabilities.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection: Input parameters `gr_1_id`, `gr_2_id`, `gr_3_id`, and `doc_id` in `index.php`, `php/lib/del.php`, `php/lib/download_backup.php`, `php/lib/navig.php`, `php/lib/restore.php`, `php/lib/set_12.php`, `php/lib/set_14.php`, and `php/lib/upd_doc.php` are not adequately sanitized.",
     "Classical SQL Injection: Login parameters `uid` and `pwd` in `php/esa.php` are not sanitized, allowing for direct SQL Injection during the authentication process."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of the Blind SQL Injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database.  The Classical SQL Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass admin authentication and gain administrative access.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Blind SQL Injection: By manipulating GET parameters `gr_1_id`, `gr_2_id`, `gr_3_id`, and `doc_id` in various files such as `index.php`.",
      "Classical SQL Injection: By manipulating POST parameters `uid` and `pwd` during the login process in `php/esa.php`."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. For the Blind SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to observe the server responses to crafted SQL queries. For the Classical SQL Injection, the attacker needs to be able to send POST requests containing malicious SQL code."
