{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Various failures in sanitizing user input, and improper handling of cookies leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the membercookie",
    "SQL injection due to insecure cookie handling",
    "Authentication bypass by forging cookies",
    "User spoofing without full login using crafted cookies",
    "Cookie poisoning allowing to change other user settings",
    "URL redirection during login for phishing attacks",
    "Bypassing of case-sensitive SQL injection protection",
        "Global namespace pollution through the use of extract() on cookies, POST, GET, etc. "
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code in users' browsers via XSS, gain unauthorized access to any account, modify other users' data, and redirect users to malicious websites. SQL injection can be used to further exploit the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating cookies, crafted URLs, and exploiting case-sensitive SQL protection bypass.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to set cookies, or craft URL parameters to exploit the vulnerabilities, no special position is needed."
