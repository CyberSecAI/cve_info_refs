  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3789",
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the recv_add_unit function.",
      "vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs when the incoming data is copied to the name buffer, which is only 26 bytes long, in the recv_add_unit function.",
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the client.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted network packet to the client during the unit addition process.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted network packet to a connected client. The attacker needs to be in a position to send network packets, potentially a malicious server or another client in a multiplayer game."
    },
   {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3789",
      "root_cause": "Invalid memory access in decode_stringmap function.",
       "vulnerability": "The decode_stringmap function, used to read the number of information (keys and values) contained in the incoming data block, has two problems: Invalid size values can lead to reading unallocated memory after the packet, causing a server crash. The server also terminates if keysize or valsize are too big and cannot be allocated with the resize function.",
      "impact": "Denial of service (crash) on the server.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending a specially crafted network packet to the server with invalid size values.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send a malicious packet to the server, either acting as a client or having control over a component that can send data to the server."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3789",
      "root_cause": "Possible code execution through arrays",
      "vulnerability": "Some commands allow crashing the remote client through invalid array indices (too big or negative). These commands allow writing data contained in the packet into arbitrary memory locations via array indexing.",
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the client.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending crafted network packets with invalid array index values using commands such as recv_rules, recv_select_unit, recv_options and recv_unit_data.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted packets to the client during gameplay. This could be a malicious server or another client in a multiplayer game."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3789",
      "root_cause": "SQL injection vulnerability.",
      "vulnerability": "The server uses an internal SQL database, and user input is not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection through the %s format argument.",
      "impact": "Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed against the server database.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending malicious SQL commands within the user's input to the server.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted packet to the server that contains SQL injection commands. This could be a malicious client or other entity that can communicate with the server."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3789",
      "root_cause": "Global buffer overflow in mapdata.",
      "vulnerability": "The mapdata global buffer, a GEODATA structure of 56 bytes, can be overflowed using the recv_map_data function.",
      "impact": "Remote Denial of Service (crash) of the client.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted network packet with more map data than the allocated buffer size to the client.",
       "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted network packet to the opponent client during the map data transfer phase. This could be a malicious server or another client in a multiplayer game."
