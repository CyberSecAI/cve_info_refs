  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2006-3082",
    "description": "The GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) was found to contain an integer overflow flaw as a result of handling large packet sizes. Using a specially crafted message, a malicious user could cause GPG to crash and/or overwrite space in memory when processing the large packets.",
    "affected_software": [
      "GnuPG versions prior to 1.4.4",
      "Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 Media Gateway products prior to CM 3.1.4",
      "Avaya Intuity LX prior to IALX 2.0",
       "Avaya Messaging Storage Server prior to MSS 3.1",
       "Avaya Message Networking prior to MN 3.1",
       "Avaya CCS/SES 3.1.1"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when processing large packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
        "Improper memory management"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application and potentially arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted message via a pipe"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to pipe data into the GnuPG application.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted input string to the `gpg` command via a pipe, leading to a crash, memory corruption or out-of-memory error.  Different variations of the crafted input can result in different outcomes, including segmentation faults, memory errors, and out-of-memory errors."
