### Bug Description

Binary package hint: spread

On start, spread creates a file /tmp/PORTNUMBER where PORTNUMBER is 4803 by default.

If an existing file named /tmp/PORTNUMBER exists, it will be deleted before a socket with the same name is created.

This is indeed pretty low impact. It does not allow a symlink attack since the file is deleted before usage, and the small race between unlink() and bind() does not hurt too much either since bind() will just fail if the file already exists. So there are two minor consequences:

\* It removes a file /tmp/<port> which might just happen to be a file which you still need

 \* It opens a small race condition for a local DoS.

Hi,

recently, a bug about insecure temporary file handling was filed in
Ubuntu [1]. After looking into the code, it does not seem that bad at
all (removal of an already existing file which might be important, and
a small race condition for a local DoS). However, it should be cleaned
up.

  "On start, spread creates a file /tmp/PORTNUMBER where PORTNUMBER is
  4803 by default.

  If an existing file named /tmp/PORTNUMBER exists, it will be deleted
  before a socket with the same name is created."

It probably does not deserve a CVE number, but now that it has got
one, please mention it in the changelog when you fix this
([CVE-2006-3118](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3118)).

Can you please pass this to upstream?

Thanks,

Martin

Hi Michael,

Just a friendly reminder that #375617 is an outstanding security issue
with spread.  There's a patch in the BTS.  It would be great to have
this fixed for etch.

Thanks,

# CVE-2006-3118

| **Name** | CVE-2006-3118 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | spread uses a temporary file with a static filename based on the port number, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating the file during a race condition between unlink and bind function calls. NOTE: spread deletes this temporary file before use, which could cause conflicts with other programs that use the same filename, but this is not a distinct issue. |
