  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Cisco Router Web Setup (CRWS) tool on some Cisco 800 and SOHO series routers ships with a default configuration that does not include an 'enable password' or 'enable secret' command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration",
      "Lack of authentication for administrative access"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute commands at the highest privilege level (level 15) through the web interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote access through the web interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability, so the attacker only needs to reach the web interface on the device which might be exposed to the Internet."
