Root cause of vulnerability: Malformed HTML messages containing JavaScript code are not properly sanitized or handled by Zoho Virtual Office.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when processing HTML messages.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into HTML messages. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and potentially other malicious activities.

Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTML message that includes malicious JavaScript code.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to send HTML messages to a user of the affected Zoho Virtual Office application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
