Discovered by: David "Aesthetico" Vieira-Kurz
http://www.majorsecurity.de
Original Advisory:
----------------------------------------------
http://www.majorsecurity.de/advisory/major\_rls18.txt
Affected Products:
----------------------------------------------
RIG 0.7.4(unstable) and prior
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=54367&release\_id=
179661)
RIG 0.6.45 and 0.7(stable) and prior
Contacted Vendor:
----------------------------------------------
I have contacted Le R'alf on June, 12th 2006 at 2:37 PM via e-mail, but until today I got no response
and the bug was still not fixed!!!
Description:
----------------------------------------------
RIG (a.k.a. the Ralf Image Gallery) is a web-based image album viewer.
The main application of RIG is a viewer for digital camera albums;
as such it offers specific functionalities like automatic image resizing and handling of dated album names.
Requirements:
----------------------------------------------
register\_globals = On
Vulnerability:
----------------------------------------------
check\_entry.php:
81: require\_once(rig\_check\_src\_file($dir\_abs\_src . "entry\_point.php"));
admin\_album.php:
31: require\_once($dir\_abs\_src . "common.php");
32: require\_once($dir\_abs\_admin\_src . "admin\_util.php");
admin\_image.php:
28: require\_once($dir\_abs\_src . "common.php");
29: require\_once($dir\_abs\_admin\_src . "admin\_util.php");
admin\_util.php:
29: require\_once($dir\_abs\_src . "common.php");
Input passed to the "dir\_abs\_src" parameter in "check\_entry.php" and the "dir\_abs\_admin\_src" parameter in
"admin\_album.php", "admin\_image.php" and "admin\_util.php" is not properly verified, before it is used to execute the given arguments.
Vuln 1: Acquiring access to known files outside of the web root and current directory
is possible through directory traversal techniques.
This is made possible through the use of "../../" in a HTTP request.
Vuln 2: This can also be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in context of an affected site.
Vuln 3: This can also be exploited to include arbitrary files from external and local resources.
Solution:
----------------------------------------------
Replace the vulnerable lines with my fixed lines.
This hotfix does only fix the the files against directory traversal and file include vulnerabilities.
Line 81 in check\_entry.php: require\_once(rig\_check\_src\_file($dir\_abs\_src . "entry\_point.php"));
MajorSecurity fix option 1: include("entry\_point.php");
MajorSecurity fix option 2: require\_once(rig\_check\_src\_file("entry\_point.php"));
In the others vuln files you need to replace following lines:
28: require\_once($dir\_abs\_src . "common.php");
29: require\_once($dir\_abs\_admin\_src . "admin\_util.php");
with my fixed lines:
28: require\_once("common.php");
29: require\_once("admin\_util.php");
Solution(Against XSS-attacks):
----------------------------------------------
Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised.
You should work with "htmlspecialchars()" or "strip\_tags()" php-function to ensure that html tags
are not going to be executed.
Example:
<?php
echo htmlspecialchars("<script");
?>
Set "register\_globals" to "Off".

| Summary  RIG is a web-based JPEG and movie album viewer, especially useful for digital camera albums; provides automatic image resizing, preview & thumbnail caching, user authentication; composed of a PHP web interface and a C++ thumbnail engine. Storage relies on file-system rather than database.  *RIG has been primarily prototyped in the soothing environment of Pennsylvania ;-)* |  |

What is RIG?

RIG (a.k.a. the Ralf Image Gallery) is a web-based image album viewer.

The main application of RIG is a viewer for digital camera albums; as such it
offers specific functionalities like automatic image resizing and handling of
dated album names.

RIG is composed of two parts:

* A set of PHP scripts allowing a user to navigate albums and display images
  via a web interface,
* A C++ "thumbnail" engine that can resize images "on the fly".
  It is used to produce thumbnails as well as resize images to the viewer's
  preference.

The images are read directly from the local file system. The directories are
interpreted as albums, each album containing an arbitrary number of images or
sub-albums. Currently only JPEG files are supported as this is the most common
format produced by digital cameras. Most modern cameras can also generate movie
files: under GNU/Linux systems, these movie files can be handled if [avifile
library](http://avifile.sourceforge.net/) is installed on the system.

RIG currently works using PHP 4 with Apache. It is mainly developed under GNU/Linux
(Debian/Apache 1.3/PHP 4) but also tested under Win32/Apache/PHP 4 or Win32/IIS
5/PHP 4. It is expected that the scripts will work with other web servers supporting
PHP or at least require only a minimal set of modifications.

RIG thumbnail, the resizing application, is a C++ application that compiles
with GCC (for GNU/Linux) or Visual Studio 6 (Win32) or Visual Studio .Net (Win32).
It is expected to be portable on other platforms using a reasonable C++-compatible
compiler. The thumbnail application has been designed with speed in mind yet
code maintenance has not been sacrificed for speed. 1600x1200 images are resized
in less than 1 second on a not-so-high end Pentium III @ 1Ghz computer (usually
in less time than is needed for the resulting image to be downloaded by the
client web browser) or in 2~3 seconds on a K6-II @ 350 MHz (i.e. a low end DSL
server).

RIG maintains a cache of resized images and a cache of generated HTML album
pages in order to produce them once. The web interface provides an administration
page that can be used to pre-compute all the resized images. The administrator
can also hide/show images or albums at will.

The web interface is composed of a small set of HTML and PHP modular scripts,
which are expected to be easy to understand and modify even for a beginner or
a non-programmer. All UI strings (for the web interface) are isolated for internationalization
purposes; default translations in English, French, Spanish and Japanese are
provided. Configuration files provide support for site-wide settings vs. album-wide
settings. It is thus possible to have different albums (with different configuration
files) served by the same server yet sharing the same PHP code base.

Features

In 2000, I wanted to update the photo album on my web site. I was previously
using statically generated web pages with one reduced version of the pictures.
I looked around and quickly found [IDS](http://ids.sourceforge.net/)
first and [Gallery](http://gallery.sourceforge.net/) later but they
didn't exactly do what I wanted. IDS was really really slow on my server and
Gallery doesn't just use the plain file system structure with a local network
upload of albums, which is a requirement for me.

So here's a quick review of RIG's features:

* *File system based*:
  + Albums are stored in plain directories and image files.
  + Name of albums and images are directly based on the file names.
  + The hierarchical structure of the directories defines the hierarchical
    structure of the albums.
  + Display ordering is based on a date prefix in album or images, as well
    as an index prefix in image names.
  + The easiest way to manage the content of your albums is by managing
    directories of pictures and transferring to your server via the network
    (Samba, NFS, FTP, SFTP, etc.) using your regular GNU/Linux or Windows
    tools.
* *Not database driven*:
  + Believe it or not, this is actually a good feature. Don't get me wrong:
    database storage of metadata is a good thing, but it is not *always*
    necessary.
  + RIG does not require any database to work and it will never do. All
    user-editable settings are stored in flat text files.
  + Backuping and mirroring a site is just a matter of handling folders
    of images and text files.
  + I have plans to implement future features that will benefit of the
    presence of a database ([pear](http://pear.php.net/) or [dbm](http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.dba.php)).
    These features will most probably be disabled by default if no database
    is present, unless they can be implemented using text or XML files with
    reasonable performances.
* *Security*:
  + RIG is built with security in mind. This can take many forms:
  + Settings:
    - The default installation allows album settings and sources to be
      stored in a specific location out of the htdocs/document root. This
      is particularly important for security-sensitive files such as users
      & passwords.
  + Web interface:
    - All HTTP GET arguments are checked for sanity. Relative paths in
      album or image names are forbidden.
    - Buffer overflows and [cross-site
      scripting](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html) issues are taken care of.
    - Form input is filtered and validated. HTML or PHP scripting is limited
      or not allowed in form inputs.
    - User authentication supports plain-text, crypt or MD5 passwords.
      Client-side cookies do not store clear passwords if crypt or MD5 is
      used.
  + Folders:
    - RIG uses special folders for upload. Uploaded images are *not*
      stored in album directories transferred manually by the user.
    - RIG will never touch the manually transferred images by default.
      Features to rename/move folders *will* be implemented either
      by using a virtual remapping or by physical remapping if the site
      admin enables it. Site administrators can change this behavior on
      a per-album basis.
* *Speed*:
  + The web interface is written in pure PHP4 and executes reasonably fast.
  + The "thumbnail" resize engine is a simplistic C++ application
    based on [libjeg62b](http://www.ijg.org/) and [libavifile](http://avifile.sourceforge.net/).
    The resize algorithm uses floating point arithmetic and has been tuned
    to achieve good performances yet keeping the code simple and readable
    (prior to that I was using a fixed-point arithmetic algorithm which was
    not that much faster, had visible artifacts when producing small thumbnails
    and was basically impossible to maintain). Aggressive optimization is
    no longer the only way to go.
  + Timing: resizing a 1600x1200 JPEG takes approximately 2~4 seconds on
    a K6@350, 1 second on a G3@350 and 0.5 seconds on a P4@1GHz.
  + RIG keeps a cache of the generated previews or thumbnails. The above
    generation time only occurs once per picture per preview size.
  + RIG maintains a cache of the generated album HTML pages. Successive
    requests of the same album or image page reuses the HTML cache, avoiding
    most of the PHP calls. A cached page is generally served in a fraction
    of a second, which means better response time and reduced server load.
    The cache is automatically regenerated when needed.
* *Flexibility*:
  + Site vs Album settings: by design, RIG can handle multiple independent
    albums on the "site" server. The common source code is shared.
    Preferences settings can be overridden by each separate albums. This allows
    the site settings to be managed by the admin and albums to be managed
    by each user account.
  + The web interface can easily support multiple languages and multiple
    layout/color themes. English, Spanish, French and Japanese are currently
    supported.
  + The theme architecture will be enhanced soon to be able to have richer
    themes, more CSS compliant.
* *Portability*:
  + The web interface is developed mostly under GNU/Linux/Apache and tested
    against Windows/Apache or Windows/IIS.
  + The C++ thumbnail engine compiles with GCC 2.95, 3.x, Visual Studio
    6 and Visual Studio .Net.
* *Non-obsolescense*:
  + RIG is still quite young. I have many ideas in mind which I haven't
    examined yet. I write RIG mostly for myself and some friends, which means
    it will continue to evolve, one idea or one feature at a time.
  + Between features I actually need and features which are too hype to
    miss, I don't see the project ending any time soon and that's just fine
    with me.
  + The best way to make sure development goes on is by using it and telling
    me about it. Comments (both negative and positive) are always welcome.

This list may be incomplete. RIG permanently evolves.

If you want information about the future of RIG, you can:

* Consult the [RIG development
  page](#.izumi/Dev/RigDev), which list things I'm thinking about and may or may not implement.
* Consult the [RIG
  todo list](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rig-thumbnail/rig/TODO.txt?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup) for a non-exhaustive list of features I'm working on.
* Simply [email me](#contact) and ask!

What is the RIG License?

RIG 0.6.2 used to have a modified version of the Artistic License.

Since RIG 0.6.3+, the license has been reverted to the pure Artistic License
to be an [Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html)
license. \*grin\*

You can consult the license here: [RIG License](LICENSE.html).

I am not a lawyer and I find licenses generally obscure to read, so what it
all means is:

* RIG is free software, it can be used for either personal, academic or commercial
  purposes at absolutely no cost.
* It comes "as-is". No guarantee, support, maintenance or installation
  help is implied.
* You are free to add any feature that you think is missing, or changing the
  source code or the look to match your own needs. I'm interested in learning
  about any feature you add, I make no promise I'd actually reuse your code.
  If you redistribute your own version, please use the same license and make
  it easy to differentiate your sources from mine.
* I love positive feedback and positive criticism. I already have an extended
  [todo
  list](http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rig-thumbnail/rig/TODO.txt?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup) of things I'd like to see in the software at some point; of course
  there is no written schedule for this, it all depends on my free time and
  my creativity. If you need something that is not on this list, please ask
  gently.
* If you'd like to, I'd be more than happy to add your site to the [sample
  site list](#demo) below.
* Your respect will earn you mine.

Starting with version 0.7, RIG is licensed under the [GNU
General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#TOCGPL).

### News

| **June 24, 2006** |  | Added final release 1.0 on Sourceforge. **Please upgrade all previous versions.** This one fixes the security vulnerability. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **June 24, 2006** |  | **A security flaw** has been disclosed 3 days ago that allows an attacker to perform PHP code injection so all RIG versions between 0.6.5 and 0.7.5 are deemed affected.  Unfortunately so-called *"security researcher"* David "Aesthetico" Vieira-Kurz failed to contact me prior to exposing the vulnerability and consequently RIG servers' of mine and some friends were hacked into. I had to spend a lot of time taking the server offline to check it and make sure it was clean, time that I could have used to patch RIG instead. Further investigation just shows that he actually failed to contact me contrary to what he claims in the [advisory](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/437818/30/0/threaded). Voluntarily disclosing a vulnerability that he knew would jeopardize personal servers is highly unethical and makes me wonder of the intentions of Aesthetico and his one-person operation at <http://majorsecurity.de/>. Full disclosure is something that should be taken very seriously and should only be done by responsible people: favoring personal fame and satisfaction over actual security is not an attitude I can condone.  The immediate consequence is that all distribution archives have been deleted. If you want to grab a version, go to sourceforce. **The final release 1.0 has a fix for this one security flaw. There might be others and I will not audit the code, so use it at your own risk** (I will however gladly integrate any security patches that are sent to me.)  The other long-term consequence is that I am officially stopping working on this project. It won't evolve. I've been burned by PHP one too many time and it's time web developers start realizing there are better alternatives to PHP nowaday. PHP was a fun tool to start learning web dev but experience shows that it is a rather innapropriate environment. |
| **April 12, 2006** |  | Added 0.7.4 on Sourceforge. |

| Stable | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0.6.4.1****Aug. 17, 2003** | **Version 0.6.4.1 is the most recent stable revision**.  A bunch of features have been introduced since version 0.6.2.3: more prefs, more themes, video support, image borders, vertical album layout, Japanese translation, album description files, PHP 4.3.2 support, crypted password, and of course many fixes!  The installation document has been revisited is can now be considered a must-read for new comers! | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-08-17\_v0641.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=179661) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=179661)] | [143 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.2.3****Nov. 4, 2002** | A bunch of features have been introduced since version 0.6.2.0, although not as much as expected. Most of the new features are visible, yet not dramatic: color themes, multiple languages user interface, better error reporting, jhead display.  It has been running on my server for around 4 months. It is considered well tested and reliable. The documentation included in this archive is rather limited. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2002-11-04\_v0623.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=142227) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=142227)] | [82 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.2.0****Nov. 30, 2001** | The "initial" revision hosted on sourceforge. This version is stable and usable, yet more features are expected to be added to the project before it can be labeled 1.0, such as album/image renaming or reorganization, authentication and upload of new images using the web interface.  This version has been available since November 2001; it has been up and running since then on my public album server as well as some other friends' servers. The documentation included in this archive is rather limited. | |  |
|  | [rig-0.6.2-011130.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=116607) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=116607)] | [60 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| Development (a.k.a. testing and/or unstable) | | | |
| **0.6.4.5****July 5, 2004** | This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful fixes.  Although considered non-stable (low testing), this release seems to perform very well. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2004-07-05\_v0645.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=251147) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=251147)] | [172 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.4.4****Dec. 7, 2003** | This version has been under testing for the past 6 months on my servers. It performed very well and has been promoted to stable. Unfortunately I found some rather annoying bugs (which I fixed in CVS already, as of 20040716), so I'm putting this back in unstable.  This version fixes a number of annoying bugs from the 0.6.4.1, especially the broken image resize popup. So if you experienced this bug, please update! | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-12-07\_v0644.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=202843) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=202843)] | [168 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.4.2****Aug. 21, 2003** | This is an intermediary dev release, with some minor but useful features: more preferences, location.php and htdocs have been updated, move dadmin sources out of the normal sources, code has been updated to comply with PHP 4.3.2 installation defaults, and finally has been tested with IIS 5 and PHP 4.3.2 on a Windows box.  Although considered non-stable (low testing and new features to be added soon), this release seems to perform very well. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-08-21\_v0642.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=179663) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=179663)] | [147 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.3.5****Aug. 13, 2003** | This version introduces some new (minor but useful) features. It seems pretty solid and is a good candidate to become 0.6.4-stable.  New features include: albums has grid vs vertical layout, displays date of modification, new "ignore lists" for albums/images (patterns of files to be ignored), introduced support for videos, fixed broken album frame for Mozilla 1.0, support in-album "file\_info.diz" or "descript.ion" files. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-08-13\_v0635.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=177922) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=177922)] | [127 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.3.3****Jun. 15, 2003** | This version features completly translated Japanese strings. Also some minor fixes & cleanup.  This is mostly untested but few problems are to be expected since the modifications were fairly limited. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-06-15\_v0633.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=165687) | [[notes](https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=165687)] | [102 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.3.2****Mar. 16, 2003** | This version introduces experimental features, like the translate-language web interface, the separate administration of albums and images. Also several fixes and more prefs.  This is mostly untested but some people prefer to live dangerously so they need unstable packages :-) | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-03-16\_v0632.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=146982) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=146982)] | [102 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.3.1****Feb. 22, 2003** | This version introduces minor features, like a gray color theme. More important, it introduces user/passwords in the login process (plain text, crypt and MD5 are supported).  This is mostly untested but few problems are to be expected since the modifications were fairly limited. | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-02-22\_v0631.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=142232) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=142232)] | [96 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.3.0****Jan. 20, 2003** | This version introduces some rewriting of the code, and some features, like display of the number of images/albums and copyrights. It also separates album options from the album cache.  Ran on my server with no problem for a little while (a month or so), before I upgraded yet again ;-). | |  |
|  | [rig\_2003-02-15\_v0630.tgz](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54367&release_id=142231) | [[notes](http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=142231)] | [92 kB] |
|  |  | |  |
| **0.6.2.4****Jan. 18, 2003** | This version is basically the same as 0.6.2.3, but with an additional URL-rewrite feature. There's a known bug in this feature (the cookie management doesn't use the rewritten URL correctly).  Currently only available via [SourceForge CVS](http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=54367), using checkout tag is "tag\_2003-01-18\_v0624". | |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
