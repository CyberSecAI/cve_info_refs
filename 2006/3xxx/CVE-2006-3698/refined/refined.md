Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-3698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist within multiple stored procedures of Oracle Database, specifically in the `SYS.DBMS_CDC_IMPDP` and `SYS.KUPW$WORKER` packages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  Improperly sanitized input in the mentioned packages allows for the injection of malicious SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breaches:** Attackers could read sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could alter or delete data without authorization.
- **Database Compromise:** Attackers could potentially gain full control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are exposed through the procedures and functions within the `SYS.DBMS_CDC_IMPDP` and `SYS.KUPW$WORKER` packages.
-  The affected procedures include: 
    - `IMPORT_CHANGE_SET`
    - `IMPORT_CHANGE_TABLE`
    - `IMPORT_CHANGE_COLUMN`
    - `IMPORT_SUBSCRIBER`
    - `IMPORT_SUBSCRIBED_TABLE`
    - `IMPORT_SUBSCRIBED_COLUMN`
    - `VALIDATE_IMPORT`
    - `VALIDATE_CHANGE_SET`
    - `VALIDATE_CHANGE_TABLE`
    - `VALIDATE_SUBSCRIPTION`
    - `MAIN` (in KUPW$WORKER)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database User Access:** The attacker needs to have database user access with the ability to create PL/SQL functions in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable packages:**  The attacker needs to know which packages and procedures are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable procedures are granted to `PUBLIC` by default in some cases, making the vulnerability easier to exploit.
- Oracle addressed these vulnerabilities in the July 2006 Critical Patch Update, specifically using the `DBMS_CDC_UTILITY` package (for `DBMS_CDC_IMPDP` and `dbms_assert` for  `KUPW$WORKER`).
