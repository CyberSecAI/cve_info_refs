  "CVE-2006-3226": {
    "Description": "Cisco Secure ACS has a vulnerability related to its session management. After successful authentication to the web interface (port 2002), the client is redirected to a dynamic HTTP server port (between 1024 and 65535). The system then relies solely on the port number and client IP address to validate the session. An attacker sharing the same IP address (proxies, NATing) could exploit the incrementing port allocation to gain administrative access.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from weak session management in Cisco Secure ACS, specifically the reliance on port and IP address for session validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient session validation",
      "Predictable port allocation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could gain full administrative access to the web interface and all managed assets (routers, switches, 802.1x networks, etc.).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting predictable port allocation",
      "IP address spoofing/sharing (proxies, NAT)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to share the same source IP address as the administrator or spoof it. The attacker also needs to determine the dynamic port assigned to the administrator, which is easily done by observing the incrementing port allocation scheme."
