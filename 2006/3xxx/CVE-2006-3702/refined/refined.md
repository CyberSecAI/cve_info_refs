{
  "CVE-2006-3702": {
    "Root cause": "The `DBMS_EXPORT_EXTENSION` package in Oracle fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input within the `GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_METADATA` routine.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker with some authentication credentials can execute arbitrary SQL statements with elevated (SYSDBA) privileges. This can allow the attacker to access and modify sensitive information within the Oracle database.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attacker supplies SQL commands through the `ODCIIndexGetMetadata` routine, which is called by the vulnerable `GET_DOMAIN_INDEX_METADATA` function within `DBMS_EXPORT_EXTENSION`."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs some form of authentication to the Oracle database to be able to call the vulnerable function. The vulnerable function is by default accessible to PUBLIC."
  }
