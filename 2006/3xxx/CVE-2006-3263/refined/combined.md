## Consult Our Professional Reviews Before Choosing Your Next Hosting Provider

Picking the right hosting provider for your website is no simple task, especially if you haven’t dealt with these types of services before. Most companies that offer hosting services use carefully tailored buzzwords and technical jargon to try to convince you to buy their products. But as with any product or service, it pays to consult objective third-party reviews before you decide to commit to a purchase. As it happens, that’s exactly what you can expect on our website.

At MamboServer we take great pride in our comprehensive step-by-step process for reviewing all the biggest hosting providers on the market. As well as some of the smaller ones. Our process involves a huge amount of research and hands-on testing that often takes several months to complete. Our highly experienced writers then take all the information we were able to gather and transform it into detailed reviews that cover everything you need to know about a particular hosting provider and its services. The entire process usually takes quite a while, but we don’t mind putting it the work because we believe the information found within these reviews is invaluable in helping users choose the best hosting service for their next project.

Get Help Choosing the Right Hosting Provider

Not sure what the difference is between a shared hosting plan and a virtual private server? Is signing up for a yearly contract better than paying on a monthly basis for your hosting? Those are just some of many questions you may have about web hosting and the companies that provide it.

We’re not claiming to have all the answers, but we do our best to shed some light on the most common questions we get from our readers.

### Cheap Web Hosting

If you’re new to web hosting you’ll probably want to go for a [cheap web hosting plan](/web-hosting/best/cheap/ "cheap web hosting plan") and work your way up from there over. That’s completely understandable, so here’s what we recommend:
[Bluehost](https://mamboserver.link/bluehost "Bluehost Cheap Web Hosting")

[Hostinger](https://mamboserver.link/hostinger "Hostinger Fast Web Hosting")
[SiteGround](https://mamboserver.link/siteground "SiteGround Fast Web Hosting")Offers starting from **$0.99 / month**
### Cloud Hosting

Shared hosting is good for beginners but you’ll eventually want to take things to the next level. When that day comes, it’s time to upgrade to a [reliable cloud](/web-hosting/best/cloud/ "reliable cloud"). Here are our top suggestions:
[Kamatera](https://mamboserver.link/kamatera "Kamatera Cloud Hosting")
[InMotion Hosting](https://mamboserver.link/inmotion-hosting "InMotion Hosting Cloud")Offers starting from **$4 / month**

[A2 Hosting](https://mamboserver.link/a2-hosting "A2 Hosting eCommerce Hosting")
[SiteGround](https://mamboserver.link/siteground "SiteGround eCommerce Hosting")Offers starting from **$2.99 / month**
### WordPress Hosting

[Bluehost](https://mamboserver.link/bluehost "Bluehost WordPress Hosting")
[HostGator](https://mamboserver.link/hostgator "HostGator WordPress Hosting")Offers starting from **$2.75 / month**
## We Compare Hosting Providers Against Each Other So You Don’t Have To

Comparing two hosting services against each other is often the best way to find out which one of them is superior. The only problem is that hosting providers usually don’t give you enough information to be able to make detailed comparisons on your own. When it comes to hosting prices, things are almost never what they seem at first glance. Meanwhile, trying to find out performance-related information from the company itself is a fool’s errand since every provider claims to be the best in that department. So what can you do? Well, you can either trust that hosting providers are objective with their marketing or you can consult an actual impartial source like MamboServer.

Web hosting comparisons are some of our favorite articles to write. We already gather tons of information about various companies and their services for our reviews, so we already have quite a lot to work with when putting together our comparisons. However, we still conduct separate research for these types of articles to make sure that our comparisons are always up to date. And also because we like to cover as many areas as possible before recommending one service over the other.
