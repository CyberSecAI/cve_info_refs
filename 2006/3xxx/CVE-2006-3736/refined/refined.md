Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-3736:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue.
- The `com_videodb` Mambo component (version 0.3en and below) has a flaw in `core/videodb.class.xml.php`.
- The `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable, which should define the absolute path to the Mambo installation, is being taken from user input without proper sanitization or validation.
- The application then uses this user-controlled variable in the `require_once` function which results in the inclusion of a remote file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The application directly includes a file specified via a GET parameter. This allows the attacker to load malicious code from an external location.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the user-supplied `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter before using it to construct the file path for inclusion. This allows an attacker to inject a URL or file path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file (shell).
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the permissions of the web server process and the included file, a complete compromise of the server is possible.
- **Data breach:** The attacker could potentially gain access to data.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker could modify content of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed via a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The vulnerable script `core/videodb.class.xml.php` is targeted via a crafted URL.
- The attacker provides a URL to a malicious script as the value of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Mambo component.
- The attacker needs to have access to a server or a location to host a malicious PHP file that can be remotely included.

**Additional details:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept exploit URL example: `http://[site]/[mambo]/components/com_videodb/core/videodb.class.xml.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[shell]`
- The vulnerability is located in the file `core/videodb.class.xml.php`.
- This vulnerability was discovered by h4ntu.
