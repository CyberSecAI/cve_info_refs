  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer incorrectly interprets the origin of a script when using a source element, allowing the script to run in a domain or Internet Explorer zone other than where it originated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-domain vulnerability",
    "Improper handling of redirects for source elements"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution and information disclosure. On Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP SP1, an attacker could gain complete control of an affected system. On other systems, an attacker could read file data from a web page in another Internet Explorer domain.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Specially crafted web page",
    "HTML email",
    "Email attachment"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page and persuade a user to view it, or send a malicious HTML email. The user interaction is required for successful exploitation."
