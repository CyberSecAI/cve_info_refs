{
  "CVE-2006-3896": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "NeoScale Systems CryptoStor 700 series appliances fail to properly perform two-factor authentication, allowing an attacker to bypass the smartcard authentication by disabling ActiveX on the client side.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The CryptoStor ActiveX component performed the second factor authentication on the client side instead of the server side.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper two-factor authentication implementation",
        "Client-side authentication vulnerability",
	"Reliance on ActiveX"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with only the username and password can gain administrative access to the CryptoStor appliance. This allows them to add, change, or delete encryption rules and keys, establish cluster members, export keys, and more.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Disabling ActiveX in the client's web browser",
	"Network access to the administration console"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires knowledge of a valid username and password for the administration console. The attacker must be able to access the login page."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is addressed in version 2.6 of the CryptoStor Tape 700 series firmware. The fix involves changing the CryptoStor ActiveX component to only report authentication success/failure, while the actual authentication is handled by a server-side CGI program. Additionally, a Thawte certificate was implemented for the CryptoStor ActiveX component."
