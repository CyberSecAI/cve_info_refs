Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-3495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) server in Mac OS X Server stores reconnect keys in a file without proper file system permission protection. This allows local users to access these keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Insecure Storage of Credentials: The reconnect keys, which allow users to reconnect to file shares after a network outage, are stored in a world-readable file. This means any authenticated local user can access these sensitive keys.
- Insufficient File System Permissions: The file containing the reconnect keys lacks appropriate access controls, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Unauthorized Access: A local user can read the reconnect keys.
- Privilege Escalation: By using the captured reconnect keys, an attacker can gain access to files and folders on the server with the system credentials of another user. This allows them to access resources they would not normally be authorized to.
- Data Exposure: Sensitive data could be exposed as a result of the unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local Access: The attack requires an authenticated local user on the vulnerable Mac OS X server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Authenticated local user account is required
- Must have access to the filesystem.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability only affects Apple Mac OS X Server.
- The vulnerability was addressed by Apple in Security Update 2006-004.
- The vulnerability was reported by Apple Product Security.
