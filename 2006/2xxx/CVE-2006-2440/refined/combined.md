How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
```
Package: imagemagick
Version: 6:6.0.6.2-2.4
Severity: normal
Tags: patch

In libMagick, DisplayImageCommand first allocates an image index array
with a size based on argc and then expands arguments containing glob
patterns which may result an increase of argc. However, the image index
array is not increased in any case.

The image index array should be allocated after the expansion of
arguments.

This is a heap overflow from user-supplied data. As 'display' is
registered as a mime handler, it might be exploited with a little user
interaction. Marking as a security bug and raising severity. Sarge is
affected. I've checked that 'display' is the only command where
ExpandFilenames() is called after allocations that rely on argc. The
other tools from the ImageMagick suite look fine with regard to this
bug.

(Also, GraphicsMagick does not seem to suffer from this bug, but that's
mostly a note to myself.)

Regards,

Daniel.

Hi,

You should have recently received (or will soon receive) an e-mail
telling you that I've closed Debian bug #345595 in the imagemagick
package, which you reported.

Due to the fact that the package was uploaded by someone who does not
normally do so, the bug was marked as "fixed" rather than closed.

Debian's bug tracking system now allows for this information to be
recorded in a more useful manner, enabling these bugs to be closed.

Due to the volume of bugs affected by this change, we are unfortunately
not sending individualized explanations for each bug. If you have
questions about the fix for your particular bug or about this email,
please contact me directly or follow up to the bug report in the Debian
BTS.

[It's possible you may receive multiple messages stating that the bug
was fixed in several different versions of the package. There are two
common reasons for this:

  - the bug was fixed in one version but subsequently found to exist
    in a later version

  - the bug existed in multiple distributions (for instance, "unstable"
    and "stable") and was thus fixed in a separate upload to each
    distribution
]

Regards,

Adam

```

 .

     (closes: #[385062](bugreport.cgi?bug=385062))
 .
 imagemagick (7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.9) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-Maintainer Upload
   * Remove all instances of the imagemagick logo from the original
     sourcefile and repack. (closes: #[214623](bugreport.cgi?bug=214623))
   * Add back the free logo patch
   * Add clean-tarball rule to accomplish this
   * Change the copyright file to indicate that the logo is no longer
     included, and indiciate that the included logo is actually text saying
     "imagemagick" with the Debian open use logo.
 .
 imagemagick (7:6.2.4.5-0.8) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * Back to 6.2.4.5 as requested by the release team to maintain binary
     compatibility. Bumped epoch once more.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.7) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * coders/url.c: Do not treat local file:// URIs as temporary files that
     are removed after reading. Closes: #[352575](bugreport.cgi?bug=352575)
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.6) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * magick/display.c: In DisplayImageCommand(), expand command line before
     allocating ressources based on argc. Patch and analysis thanks to
     Eero Häkkinen. Closes: #[345595](bugreport.cgi?bug=345595)
   * magick/{animate.c,blob.c,display.c,image.c,log.c,montage.c,string.c,
     string_.h}: Implement new utility function FormatMagickStringNumeric()
     to securely expand a user-supplied format string with a single numeric
     argument. Adjust code to use this function where appropriate.
     ([CVE-2006-0082](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0082)) Closes: #[345876](bugreport.cgi?bug=345876)

   * debian/imagemagick.mime: Rather than autodetect the type of an image,
     derive it from the mime type. As a side effect, this change allows to
     use arbitrary filenames with the 'see' command, even if they have
     special meaning to imagemagick internally. Also clean up some typos
     and superfluous entries once we're at it. Closes: #[344997](bugreport.cgi?bug=344997)

 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.4) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload to resolve buildability/installability.
   * debian/{control,rules}: Disable DPS support, which is no longer shipped
     in Xorg 6.9/7.0 (and was making us both FTBFS and uninstallable in sid)
   * debian/control: explicitely build-depend on libxext-dev, since we both
     test for and use it directly, rather than indirectly.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.3) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * debian/control: Rename libmagick++9 to libmagick++9c2a, following a
     C++ ABI transition. Conflicts with and Replaces old version.
   * debian/*: Rename various debhelper support files due to above name
     change.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.5-0.2) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * debian/control: libmagick9-dev Conflicts/Replaces libmagick6-dev.

   * debian/control: Provide unversioned libmagick-dev and libmagick++-dev
     and conflict/replace them for future-proof handling of soname bumps.

 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * New upstream version.

     library packages names in multiple places.
 .
 imagemagick (6:6.2.4.4-0.1) experimental; urgency=low
 .
   * Non-maintainer upload.
   * New upstream version.
     + Version in library soname was increased from 6 to 7 due to
       changes in binary interface starting with 6.0.7. (Yes, this
       should have happened earlier.) Closes: #[318176](bugreport.cgi?bug=318176), #[325651](bugreport.cgi?bug=325651), #[325720](bugreport.cgi?bug=325720)
   * debian/*: Rename packages from libmagick6 to libmagick7, and similar.
     Adjust version in various places accordingly. Drop c2 suffix from
     C++ library package.
   * debian/control: Use shlibs information to generate Depends line for
     imagemagick binary package.
   * debian/control: Remove Pre-Depends on prehistoric version of dpkg.
   * debian/control: Package complies with policy version 3.6.2. Bump
     Standards-Version accordingly.
   * Patches to upstream sources:
     + [bin/Magick++-config.1.debdiff]
       Stray file that seems to have slipped into the previous Debian
       diffs by mistake. Removed now.
     + [magick/blob.c]
       Originally a patch from upstream, now mostly merged. Retaining a
       single hunk that upstream reverted later on, though it still looks
       correct.
     + [configure.ac, configure]
       Override location of documentation files to Debian's default
       /usr/share/doc/imagemagick. Patch to configure was present before.
       This release promotes it back to configure.ac as well. (No ill
       effects because AM_MAINTAINER_MODE is used.)
     + [coders/magick.c]
       Drop patch that exchanges upstream's logo for a DFSG-free version.
       This attempt to address #214623 (distribution of non-free logo)
       missed several other instances of the logo, must be applied to
       the orig.tar.gz rather than the Debian diff, and should have
       some input from upstream, so no point in carrying it around still.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : imagemagick
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2440 CVE-2006-3743 CVE-2006-3744
Debian Bug     : 345595

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Imagemagick, a
collection of image manipulation tools, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-2440

    Eero Häkkinen discovered that the display tool allocates insufficient
    memory for globbing patterns, which might lead to a buffer overflow.

CVE-2006-3743

    Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the Sun
    bitmap decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-3744

    Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the XCF
    image decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 6:6.0.6.2-2.7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
