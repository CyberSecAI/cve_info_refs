Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flawed regular expression used to sanitize user-supplied HTML in W-Agora 4.20. The regex `on([a-zA-Z]\*)?=(.\*)?` aims to remove HTML attributes starting with "on" (like `onclick`, `onmouseover`). However, it incorrectly assumes that the "=" character will immediately follow the "on" event.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the inadequate sanitization of user-supplied HTML. The regex filter is too simplistic and can be easily bypassed.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This leads to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.  Because the application doesn't properly sanitize the HTML, malicious HTML with JavaScript can be injected into the application and executed when other users view it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:** If the application uses cookies for session management, the XSS vulnerability can be used to steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:**  The injected JavaScript can be used to perform other malicious actions, such as redirecting users to phishing pages, defacing the site, or performing actions on the victim's behalf.
*   **Integrity Impact:** As the attacker could modify the displayed content this leads to partial integrity impact.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could access the session cookies, which are considered confidential, leading to impact on confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting specially crafted HTML into areas of the application that accept user input (e.g., forum posts).
*   **Bypassed Sanitization:**  Specifically, an attacker can insert a space before the `=` in an event handler, thus bypassing the flawed regex filter e.g. `<b onMouseOver =eval('alert(/xss/)')>hi</b>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote as the website is accessible via internet.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need an account to inject the malicious script.
*   **Medium Complexity:** The attack requires understanding how the filtering works to construct a bypass payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a specific example of how to exploit the vulnerability by using `<b onMouseOver =eval('alert(/xss/)')>hi</b>`
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to be exploitable in both IE and Firefox.
*   The content notes that the application can use either cookies or sessions for user info, which affects the method for cookie stealing.
*   A video demo of the exploit is available (though external link provided)
