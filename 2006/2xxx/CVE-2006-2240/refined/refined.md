{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered using the PROTOS DNS Test Tool, which simulates hostile input by sending invalid or abnormal packets to DNS implementations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerabilities include issues related to handling of queries, query replies, dynamic DNS updates, zone transfers, and the DNS stub resolver (client).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause the DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. In some cases, an attacker could take control of a DNS server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attack vectors involve sending crafted DNS packets to vulnerable implementations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely by sending specially crafted DNS packets."
