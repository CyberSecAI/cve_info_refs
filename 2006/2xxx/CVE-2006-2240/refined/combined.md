How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Multiple vulnerabilities in DNS implementations

#### Vulnerability Note VU#955777

Original Release Date: 2006-04-28 | Last Revised: 2006-05-23

---

### Overview

Numerous vulnerabilities have been reported in various Domain Name System (DNS) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or cause a DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.

### Description

| **DNS**  The Domain Name System provides name, address, and other information about Internet Protocol (IP) networks and devices. **The Problems**The U.K. National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Center (NISCC) and the Oulu University Secure Programming Group have reported numerous vulnerabilities in DNS implementations. These vulnerabilities were discovered using the PROTOS [DNS Test Tool](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c09/dns/index.html) developed by [Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG)](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/.). The results of the tests are described in [NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 144154/NISCC/DNS](http://www.niscc.gov.uk/niscc/docs/re-20060425-00312.pdf?lang=en). According to that advisory:*There are three sets of test materials available with the tool; these are specifically designed for the following scenarios: 1. The Query Material -> [queries, dynamic DNS updates] -> DNS server 2. The Response Material -> [query replies] -> DNS server 3. The Response Material -> [query replies] -> DNS stub resolver (client) 4. The Zone Transfer Material -> [zone transfers] -> secondary DNS server* *The test material simulates hostile input to the DNS implementation by sending invalid and/or abnormal packets.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| These vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause an DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.  Exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to take control of a DNS server. Once a DNS server compromised, the attacker may be able to launch attacks on other, unaffected DNS servers. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from an affected product vendor |

### [F5 Networks, Inc.](#MIMG-6P8GN9) Affected

Notified:  April 26, 2006  Updated: May 03, 2006

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

F5's 3-DNS and GTM products are vulnerable to the same extent that BIND itself is vulernable. F5 products will be patched when ISC relea

ses fixes to BIND.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Juniper Networks, Inc.](#MIMG-6P8GQ8) Affected

Notified:  April 26, 2006  Updated: April 27, 2006

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The OUSPG PROTOS c09-dns-response test tool was run against all Juniper Networks platforms. JUNOS and ScreenOS were unaffected. Tests against JUNOSe, found on the E-series routers, did

result in an issue with the DNS client code (ref: KA 23381). The issue was resolved in the following JUNOSe updates: 5-3-5p0-2, 6-0-3p0-6, 6-0-4, 6-1-3p0-1, 7-0-1p0-7, 7-0-2, 7-1-0p0-1,
7-1-1. Later JUNOSe releases are unaffected.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Openwall GNU/\*/Linux](#MIMG-6P8GRP) Affected

Notified:  April 26, 2006  Updated: May 10, 2006

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Openwall GNU/\*/Linux (Owl) 2.0 contains BIND 9 and a DNS resolver as a part of the GNU C Library (glibc), both with our modifications. Owl 1.1 and earlier releases did not include BIND.

Although there's limited information on these vulnerabilities available, we believe that the BIND 9 package in Owl is affected to the same (very limited) extent that is documented in the statement from the ISC found in the PDF version of the NISCC Vulnerability Advisory 144154/NISCC/DNS and that the DNS resolver in glibc is not affected at all.

Assuming that the ISC's description of the issue is correct, we agree with the ISC's assessment of this issue as minor enough to not require updates for current and past releases. Instead, a fix is expected to be included in a future release of BIND - and we are going to similarly include that in a future release of Owl.

The ISC's description of the issue implies that for the attack to work the DNS server must be configured to use TSIG-based authentication of transactions and the attacker must in fact authenticate successfully. Thus, it appears that the attack may only be carried out via a related previously compromised DNS server and only if both servers are configured to use TSIG-based authentication. The impact of a successful attack is limited to denial of the DNS service.
