ASPR #2006-05-17-1: Buffer Overflow In Retroclient Service
=========================================================================
Document ID: ASPR #2006-05-17-1-PUB
Vendor: EMC (http://www.emc.com)
Target: Retrospect 7.5 Client for Windows
(http://www.emcinsignia.com/products/smb/retroforwin/)
Impact: A buffer overflow vulnerability in Retroclient service
can be exploited to crash Retrospect clients in the
network.
Severity: Medium
Status: Official patch available
Discovered by: Luka Treiber of ACROS Security
Current version
http://www.acrossecurity.com/aspr/ASPR-2006-05-17-1-PUB.txt
We would like to acknowledge Eric Baize and Jamie Albertson from EMC
for extremely diligent and professional handling of the identified
vulnerability.
Summary
=======
A buffer overflow vulnerability in Retroclient service can be exploited
to crash Retrospect clients in the network. This enables an attacker to
easily disable the backup process throughout an organization.
Product Coverage
================
- Retrospect 7.5 Client for Windows - affected
Older versions are likely to be affected as well.
Analysis
========
Altering content of one of the packets sent to the client during server-
client communication can result in a buffer overflow condition, which
crashes the client service.
Consequently, the automated backup process on the affected client no
longer works. Moreover, under specific circumstances this vulnerability
could be exploited for executing arbitrary code on the system running
the Retrospect client.
Note that access to corporate network is needed for exploiting this
vulnerability as it requires an attacker to establish a network
connection to a vulnerable client.
Attack Scenario:
The attacker is connected to a corporate network with his laptop. Using a
port scanner, she locates machines with port 497 open, indicating the
presence of Retroclient service. Using her malicious tool she mimics
Retrospect server's behavior: simultaneously the tool connects to
enumerated clients and sends them malicious data as described in the
analysis above, which results in their crashing. In a short period of
time all Retrospect clients in the network are disabled.
Solution
========
EMC has issued a security bulletin [1] and published a patch
which fixes this issue.
Workaround
==========
- We're not aware of any efficient workarounds for this issue.

## EMC Retrospect Client buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#186944

Original Release Date: 2006-05-16 | Last Revised: 2006-05-16

---

### Overview

EMC Retrospect Client contains a buffer overflow. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| **EMC Retrospect Backup and Recovery Software**  EMC Retrospect is a is a backup and recovery application designed for small to medium sized networks. In a typical Retrospect setup, the EMC Retrospect Client software is installed on all of the computers that require backups. The clients are then configured to listen on port 497/tcp for commands from the EMC Retrospect Server. Note that the EMC Backup runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows systems and root privileges on UNIX-based systems.**The Problem** There is a buffer overflow in the EMC Retrospect Client. The overflow can be triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to a system running a vulnerable version of the EMC Retrospect Client software.Please refer to the EMC Retrospect Knowledgebase Article# [9511](http://kb.dantz.com/display/2n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=9511) for information on affected versions of the EMC Retrospect Client software. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If a remote attacker sends a specially crafted packet to an EMC Retrospect Client installation, that attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Upgrade to a patched version of the EMC Retrospect Client. A list of fixed EMC Retrospect Clients is available in EMC Retrospect Knowledgebase Article# [9511](http://kb.dantz.com/display/2n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=9511). |
| --- |

| In addition, the following workaround may mitigate this vulnerability.**Restrict access**You may wish to block access to the vulnerable software from outside your network perimeter, specifically by blocking access to the port used by EMC Retrospect Client (497/tcp). This will limit your exposure to attacks. However, blocking at the network perimeter would still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit the vulnerability. The use of host-based firewalls in addition to network-based firewalls can help restrict access to specific hosts within the network. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. |
