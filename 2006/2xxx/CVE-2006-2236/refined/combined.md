How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-05 13:32:04 UTC  ``` <http://secunia.com/advisories/19984/>  Description: landser has reported a vulnerability in Quake 3 Engine, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.  The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of the "remapShader" command. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via specially crafted "remapShader" commands sent to a client.  Successful exploitation may allow arbitrary code execution, but requires that the user is e.g. tricked into connecting to a malicious game server.  The vulnerability has been reported in the following software: * ET 2.60. * Return to Castle Wolfenstein 1.41. * Quake III Arena 1.32b.  Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Do not connect to non-trusted game servers.  Provided and/or discovered by: landser  Original Advisory: <http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/1750> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-06 05:36:46 UTC  ``` Affects also Enemy Territory according to heise.de. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-06 05:49:49 UTC  ``` right  can we group games-fps/enemy-territory* and games-fps/quake3* into this unique bug ? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-07 07:24:56 UTC  ``` Well, since it looks like we won't be getting updated versions of these, I'm going to try to see if there's any unofficial patches which resovle this bug, then mask, if not. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-08 02:11:09 UTC  ``` <http://thilo.kickchat.com/patches/quake3-1.32b-remapshader-fix.diff> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-08 13:40:24 UTC  ``` <http://www.bluesnews.com/plans/476/>  Even better... id Software has released new versions of all of these binaries.  I'll be creating some new ebuilds this evening for them all. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-08 13:50:53 UTC  ``` Thanks Chris ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 06:33:53 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 132781](show_bug.cgi?id=132781 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - enemy-territory bump to 2.60b") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 07:24:29 UTC  ``` These are all in the tree now:  enemy-territory 2.60b quake3-bin 1.32c rtcw 1.41b  They are already tested and marked stable on x86 and amd64.  The older versions have been masked, and will probably stay that way for a few days.  Everything should be ready for a GLSA now.  =] ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 09:37:19 UTC  ``` Yep, thx ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 22:39:26 UTC  ``` GLSA-200605-12 , thanks jaervosz ``` |  |

non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
