{
  "CVE-2006-2936": {
    "Description": "A flaw in the input handling of the ftdi_sio driver that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)",
    "Root cause": "The ftdi_sio driver did not limit the amount of pending data to be written.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Lack of resource limits"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user could exploit this to drain all available kernel memory and thus render the system unusable (Denial of Service)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Local user"
    ],
	"Additional Information": "The vulnerability was located in the write routine of the ftdi_sio driver. An unprivileged user writing a lot of data to a serial port can use up all system memory by writing lots of data."
