Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The `xmcdconfig` script in the `xmcd` package creates directories `/var/lib/cddb` and `/var/lib/xmcd/discog` with world-writable permissions (mode 777). This occurs because the `CDIRPERM` variable is explicitly set to 777 in the `xmcdconfig` script, and then used when creating the directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Permissions:** The core issue is the creation of directories with excessively permissive world-writable permissions.
*   **Design Flaw:** The vulnerability is due to a design flaw in the `xmcdconfig` script, where it hardcodes the `CDIRPERM` variable to 777.
*   **Incorrect Fix Attempts**: Although prior attempts were made to set the correct permissions during the package install via postinst scripts, `xmcdconfig` was run after these changes and overwrites them with mode 777.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Local users can fill the `/var` and `/usr` partitions by creating numerous files and directories within the world-writable directories, leading to disk exhaustion and system instability.
*   **Data Loss:** Unprivileged users can delete the collected CD database information stored in these directories.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system. Any local user, including those with minimal privileges and potentially compromised processes running as "nobody" (e.g., PHP scripts), can exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the affected system.
*  **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Debian GNU/Linux versions prior to the fixes implemented in `xmcd` package versions 2.6-14woody1 for woody, 2.6-17sarge1 for sarge, and 2.6-17.2 for unstable.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2006-2542.
*   The bug report (366816) includes a patch proposed by Martin Schulze to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerability is a design flaw in the `xmcdconfig` script.
