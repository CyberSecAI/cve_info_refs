  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2866",
      "root_cause": "The `blog_dc_path` variable in DotClear is not sanitized before being used to include files. This lack of sanitization, combined with PHP5's support for FTP wrappers in functions like `is_dir()` and `file_exists()`, allows for arbitrary remote file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary File Inclusion",
        "Lack of Input Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote. By crafting a malicious URL containing a remote FTP location in the `blog_dc_path` parameter and sending it to the vulnerable `prepend.php` file.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the `blog_dc_path` parameter and have access to an FTP server to host a malicious PHP file. The server needs to have `register_globals=On`, and `allow_url_fopen=On` in PHP settings."
