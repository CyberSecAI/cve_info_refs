  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A change in the build process inadvertently disabled the 'securenets' access restrictions in ypserv(8).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inoperative access controls",
      "Failure to properly load or process networks/hosts specified in /var/yp/securenets"
    ],
    "impact": "ypserv(8) does not enforce access restrictions defined in /var/yp/securenets, making them ineffective.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the ypserv(8) service"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have network access to the ypserv(8) service. No specific level of privilege on the target system is required to exploit the vulnerability as the issue is in access control enforcement."
