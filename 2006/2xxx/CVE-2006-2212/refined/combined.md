REWTERZ-20060504 - Sami FTP Server Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Release Date:
May 4, 2006
Severity:
High (Remote Code Execution)
Vendor:
KarjaSoft
Software Affected:
Sami FTP Server v2.0.2 and before
Operating Systems Affected:
Windows NT 4.0
Windows 98 / ME
Windows 2000
Windows XP
Windows 2003
Overview:
rewterz has discovered a critical vulnerability in Sami FTP Server. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to overwrite memory with user controlled data and execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who executed the Sami FTP Server.
Technical Details:
This vulnerability exists in the handling of both username and password input provided by the user while making connection to FTP server. We chose not to provide detailed information about the location of the vulnerability and how to reproduce it because the author hasn't confirmed this vulnerability. We can pass a long argument with some commands into a buffer. There is no checking of the length of these inputs. Depending on the input, this will cause exploitable condition.
We have confirmed the ability to execute our own code. This is a common buffer overflow vulnerability and can be exploited easily.
