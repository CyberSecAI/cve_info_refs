VS Release Version 1.0.1
2006-06-10 15:28 - Vice Stats

Hot on the tails of the version 1.0 release, some kind soul reported a
security vulnerability to secunia rather than to me directly. Either way,
it's fixed now, and is only inside the reporting interface. If you use
the multi-user option (which is password protected) or otherwise limit
availability to vs_resources.php and vs_search.php then you have no
problems.

Bugfixes:

    * Security fixes in vs_resource.php and vs_search.php for potential
SQL injection.
