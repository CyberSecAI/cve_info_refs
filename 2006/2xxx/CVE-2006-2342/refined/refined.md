Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is related to how welcome pages are secured in the IBM WebSphere Application Server. Specifically, the security constraint using `/*` as a URL pattern does not properly secure welcome pages when accessed directly using the context root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure welcome page access:** Welcome pages are not adequately protected by the security constraint when accessed directly via the context root of the application. This allows unauthorized access to welcome pages

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided text does not detail the exact impact of this vulnerability. However, unauthorized access to the welcome pages might expose sensitive information or reveal details about the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can directly access the welcome pages by using the application's context root in the URL. The vulnerability arises from the security configuration not explicitly denying direct access via the context root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the application's context root. No special privileges are mentioned. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is related to IBM WebSphere Application Server version 6.0.2. This vulnerability is addressed by the fix PK10057.
*   The vulnerability is specifically related to how the application server handles security constraints with `/*` and welcome pages.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause:** Inadequate security constraint for welcome pages when accessed directly via context root.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure welcome page access.
*   **Impact:** Potentially expose sensitive information and/or details about the application's functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to welcome pages via the application context root.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Knowledge of the application context root.
