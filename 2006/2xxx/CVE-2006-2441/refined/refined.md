- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A meta-server without the server console installed can be crashed by an old client requesting a new game creation. This issue stems from the meta-server's interaction with older clients and its dependency on server-console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The meta-server lacks proper handling of requests from older clients when the server-console is not installed, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The meta-server becomes unavailable, disrupting game play for users depending on the meta-server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network connection from an older client (gnocatan from sarge).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to use an older client (gnocatan) and be able to connect to the vulnerable meta-server.
