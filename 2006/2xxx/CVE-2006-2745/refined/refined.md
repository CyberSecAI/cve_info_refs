        "Unsanitized user input",
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",

      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to p-popupgallery.php with a crafted 'l' parameter.",
        "HTTP GET request to p-editbox.php with a crafted 'pathfile' parameter.",

        "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.",

      ],
      "details": "The vulnerability exists in F@cile Interactive Web <= 0.8x. The 'l' parameter in p-popupgallery.php is vulnerable to file inclusion. Additionally, the 'pathfile' parameter in p-editpage.php and p-editbox.php is also vulnerable. Furthermore, the 'mytheme' and 'myskin' parameters in themes are not sanitized, and the 'lang' parameter in index.php is also vulnerable. If magic_quotes_gpc is off, internal files can be included; if allow_url_fopen is on, external files can be included. The vulnerabilities in p-editpage.php and p-editbox.php also allow external resources to be included in php5 with register_globals enabled."
