How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

java-1.5.0-sun security update (RHSA-2009-0394)

Original Release Date: March 26, 2009

Last Revised: March 26, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-109

Risk Level: None

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.5.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 5 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 5 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 5 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 5 Software Development Kit. These
vulnerabilities are summarized on the "Advance notification of Security
Updates for Java SE" page from Sun Microsystems, listed in the References
section. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2006-2426](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2426), [CVE-2009-1093](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1093), [CVE-2009-1094](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1094), [CVE-2009-1095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1095), [CVE-2009-1096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1096), [CVE-2009-1098](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1098), [CVE-2009-1099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1099), [CVE-2009-1100](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1100), [CVE-2009-1103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1103), [CVE-2009-1104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1104) and [CVE-2009-1107](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1107) to these issues.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as java-1.5.0-sun is not installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0394.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.5.0-sun installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.6.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. These
vulnerabilities are summarized on the "Advance notification of Security
Updates for Java SE" page from Sun Microsystems, listed in the References
section. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2006-2426](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2426), [CVE-2009-1093](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1093), [CVE-2009-1094](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1094), [CVE-2009-1095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1095), [CVE-2009-1096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1096), [CVE-2009-1097](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1097), [CVE-2009-1098](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1098), [CVE-2009-1099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1099), [CVE-2009-1100](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1100), [CVE-2009-1101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1101), [CVE-2009-1102](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1102), [CVE-2009-1103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1103), [CVE-2009-1104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1104), [CVE-2009-1105](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1105), [CVE-2009-1106](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1106) and [CVE-2009-1107](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1107) to these issues.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as java-1.6.0-sun is not installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0392.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-sun installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : openjdk-6
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2006-2426 CVE-2009-0581 CVE-2009-0723 CVE-2009-0733 CVE-2009-0793 CVE-2009-1093 CVE-2009-1094 CVE-2009-1095 CVE-2009-1096 CVE-2009-1097 CVE-2009-1098 CVE-2009-1101

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform.

Creation of large, temporary fonts could use up available disk space,
leading to a denial of service condition (CVE-2006-2426).

Several vulnerabilities existed in the embedded LittleCMS library,
exploitable through crafted images: a memory leak, resulting in a
denial of service condition (CVE-2009-0581), heap-based buffer
overflows, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733), and a null-pointer dereference,
leading to denial of service (CVE-2009-0793).

The LDAP server implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) did not properly
close sockets if an error was encountered, leading to a
denial-of-service condition (CVE-2009-1093).

The LDAP client implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) allowed
malicious LDAP servers to execute arbitrary code on the client
(CVE-2009-1094).

The HTTP server implementation (sun.net.httpserver) contained an
unspecified denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2009-1101).

Several issues in Java Web Start have been addressed (CVE-2009-1095,
CVE-2009-1096, CVE-2009-1097, CVE-2009-1098).  The Debian packages
currently do not support Java Web Start, so these issues are not
directly exploitable, but the relevant code has been updated
nevertheless.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1+lenny2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0377)

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
contains the software and tools that users need to run applications written
using the Java programming language.

A flaw was found in the way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handled
temporary font files. A malicious applet could use this flaw to use large
amounts of disk space, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2426)

A memory leak flaw was found in LittleCMS (embedded in OpenJDK). An
application using color profiles could use excessive amounts of memory, and
possibly crash after using all available memory, if used to open
specially-crafted images. (CVE-2009-0581)

Multiple integer overflow flaws which could lead to heap-based buffer
overflows, as well as multiple insufficient input validation flaws, were
found in the way LittleCMS handled color profiles. An attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially-crafted image file which could cause a
Java application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened.
(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733)

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in LittleCMS. An application
using color profiles could crash while converting a specially-crafted image
file. (CVE-2009-0793)

A flaw in the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) service endpoint
handling could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on the
server application hosting the JAX-WS service endpoint. (CVE-2009-1101)

A flaw in the way the Java Runtime Environment initialized LDAP connections
could allow a remote, authenticated user to cause a denial of service on
the LDAP service. (CVE-2009-1093)

A flaw in the Java Runtime Environment LDAP client could allow malicious
data from an LDAP server to cause arbitrary code to be loaded and then run
on an LDAP client. (CVE-2009-1094)

Several buffer overflow flaws were found in the Java Runtime Environment
unpack200 functionality. An untrusted applet could extend its privileges,
allowing it to read and write local files, as well as to execute local
applications with the privileges of the user running the applet.
(CVE-2009-1095, CVE-2009-1096)

A flaw in the Java Runtime Environment Virtual Machine code generation
functionality could allow untrusted applets to extend their privileges. An
untrusted applet could extend its privileges, allowing it to read and write
local files, as well as execute local applications with the privileges
of the user running the applet. (CVE-2009-1102)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the splash screen processing. A remote
attacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as
to execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
java process. (CVE-2009-1097)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in how GIF images were processed. A remote
attacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as
execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
java process. (CVE-2009-1098)

Note: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-1095,
CVE-2009-1096, and CVE-2009-1102, can only be triggered in
java-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the "appletviewer" application.

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.
