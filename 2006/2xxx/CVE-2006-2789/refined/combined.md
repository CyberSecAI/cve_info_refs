| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c0)  Nathan Owens    2005-07-25 00:40:45 UTC  ``` Steps to reproduce: 1. Load the e-mail in the attachment (see below) 2. View the e-mail (either by opening it or through the preview pane) 3. Watch it crash.   Stack trace: stack trace:  ```  + [Trace 61973](page.cgi?id=traceparser/trace.html&trace_id=61973)   | * #0   camel\_internet\_address\_get   at camel-internet-address.c   line   331 * #1   em\_utils\_in\_addressbook   at em-utils.c   line   1811 * #2   emfh\_gethttp   at em-format-html.c   line   459 * #3   efh\_format\_do   at em-format-html.c   line   1329 * #4   mail\_msg\_received   at mail-mt.c   line   556 * #5   thread\_dispatch   at e-msgport.c   line   826 * #6   start\_thread   from   /lib/tls/libpthread.so.0 * #7   clone   from   /lib/tls/libc.so.6 | | --- |  ```   Output in the console window: (evolution-2.4:24797): camel-CRITICAL **: camel_object_is: assertion `o != NULL' failed  camel-ERROR **: file camel-internet-address.c: line 331 (camel_internet_address_get): assertion failed: (CAMEL_IS_INTERNET_ADDRESS(addr)) aborting...  Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.   The e-mail source will be attached after posting the bug.  Other information: This was popped off gmail.  What's crashing is that the 'from' address in the message structure becomes NULL somewhere along the way, and this eventually gets passed to camel_internet_address_get. camel_internet_address_get tries to asser that addr is a valid camel internet address, and fails due to addr=0x0. This addr is supposed to be the 'from' address at this point.  In this message, there are 2 'From:' headers. One has an e-mail address with valid syntax, the other (which comes later) has nothing after it. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c1)  Nathan Owens    2005-07-25 00:45:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 49694](attachment.cgi?id=49694 "e-mail source that caused Evolution to crash") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=49694&action=edit "e-mail source that caused Evolution to crash") e-mail source that caused Evolution to crash  If you load this into an existing folder (either a newly created one with only this message or append it to one with messages already in it), it will show up. Then, after viewing it, Evolution will crash. It seems the whole message (or at least most of it) is necessary to crash Evolution. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c2)  Nathan Owens    2005-07-25 00:47:33 UTC  ``` Oh, one other thing. This crash has been happening since May 2005. I'm using some of the latest stuff from CVS (at least from July 18, 2005) and it's still crashing. I don't know enough about the mailer component (or e-mail formatting), or I'd try to create a patch for it myself. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c3)  Not Zed    2005-07-28 02:16:22 UTC  ``` workaround: turn off the setting "load images if sender in addressbook"  ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c4)  Not Zed    2005-07-28 02:22:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 49859](attachment.cgi?id=49859 "fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=49859&action=edit "fix") [[review]](review?bug=311440&attachment=49859) fix  this bug almost certainly has duplicates too ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c5)  Not Zed    2005-07-29 01:45:20 UTC  ``` patch applied  ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c6)  Not Zed    2005-08-02 06:29:53 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 309453](show_bug.cgi?id=309453 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Crash during start-up if no From address in an email") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=311440#c7)  Not Zed    2005-08-25 05:17:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 314395](show_bug.cgi?id=314395 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - E-mail crashes Evolution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=309453#c0)  Toni Eliasz    2005-07-04 15:41:08 UTC  ``` Distribution/Version: 10.3.9  From Evolution users mailing list  Thread - Evolution 2.2 Start-up Crash and Problem Solving Process (Mac OS X)  Message I: > For some reason when I was moving files this morning > the application crashed and unfortunately I haven't > been able to re-launch it again. When trying to > re-launch Evolution it will crash almost immediately. > Only processing that I can see is that the application > is scanning the mail forders just before the crash.  Message II: I think that was my own fault. I migrated from Win to Mac only a month ago and haven't really had the need to learn how the "engine" has structured. So when I started Evolution I looked for the a file under the Applications folder and found that applet that seemed to open the application (exactly the same than just double-clicking the icon under GUI).  Now I located the following bin file: /opt/gnome-2.10/bin/evolution-2.2  When trying to run it without dgb I'm getting the following output:  -----8<---------------------------------- (evolution-2.2:3846): Gtk-WARNING **: Could not find the icon 'stock_mail'.

Can the submitter please check if the bug is still valid.
