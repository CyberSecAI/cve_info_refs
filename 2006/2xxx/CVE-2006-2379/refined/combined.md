## Microsoft IP Source Route Vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#722753

Original Release Date: 2006-06-13 | Last Revised: 2006-06-13

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Windows could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Source routing is a technique to determine the network route for a packet based on information supplied by the sender in the IP packet. The TCP/IP driver in some versions of Microsoft Windows contains a buffer overflow in the handling of packets with source routing information. The driver fails to validate the length of a message before it is passed to an allocated buffer. Microsoft states that IP packets containing IP source route options 131 and 137 could be used to initiate a connection with the affected components. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to supply a specially crafted packet may be able to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with kernel privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Microsoft has published patches for this issue in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-032](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-032.mspx). Users are encouraged to review this bulletin and apply the patches it refers to. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  In addition to the patches, Microsoft has also published a number of [workarounds](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-032.mspx#ELIAC) for this issue in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-032](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-032.mspx). Users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patch, are encouraged to implement these workarounds. |

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

**Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures**

J.D. Meier, Alex Mackman, Michael Dunner, Srinath Vasireddy, Ray Escamilla and Anandha Murukan

Microsoft Corporation

Published: June 2003

Last Revised: January 2006

#### Applies to:

* Microsoft WindowsÂ® 2000 operating system

See the "[patterns & practices Security Guidance for Applications Index](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998408.aspx)" for links to additional security resources.

See the [Landing Page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994921) for the starting point and a complete overview of *Improving Web Application Security: Threats and Countermeasures*.

**Summary:** You can configure various TCP/IP parameters in the Windows registry in order to protect against network-level denial of service attacks including SYN flood attacks, ICMP attacks and SNMP attacks. You can configure registry keys to:

* Enable SYN flood protection when an attack is detected.
* Set threshold values that are used to determine what constitutes an attack.

This How To shows an administrator which registry keys and which registry values must be configured to protect against network-based denial of service attacks.

> **Note**   These settings modify the way TCP/IP works on your server. The characteristics of your Web server will determine the best thresholds to trigger denial of service countermeasures. Some values may be too restrictive for your client connections. Test this document's recommendations before you deploy to a production server.

#### Contents

This How To is divided into sections that address specific types of denial of service protections that apply to the network. Those sections are:

What You Must Know Protect Against SYN Attack Protect Against ICMP Attacks Protect Against SNMP Attacks AFD.SYS Protections Additional Protections Pitfalls Additional Resources

### What You Must Know

TCP/IP is an inherently insecure protocol. However, the Windows 2000 and 2003 implementation allows you to configure its operation to counter network denial of service attacks. Some of the keys and values referred to in this How To may not exist by default. In those cases, create the key, value, and value data.

For more details about the TCP/IP network settings that the registry for Windows 2000 controls, see the white paper "Microsoft Windows 2000 TCP/IP Implementation Details" at <https://www.microsoft.com/technet/solutionaccelerators/network/deploy/depovg/tcpip2k.mspx>.

> **Note**   This How to is specific to Windows 2000. For information on how to harden the TCP/IP stack in Windows Server 2003, see "[How to harden the TCP/IP stack against Denial of Service Attacks in Windows Server 2003](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324270)."

## Protect Against SYN Attacks

A SYN attack exploits a vulnerability in the TCP/IP connection establishment mechanism. To mount a SYN flood attack, an attacker uses a program to send a flood of TCP SYN requests to fill the pending connection queue on the server. This prevents other users from establishing network connections.

To protect the network against SYN attacks, follow these generalized steps, explained later in this document:

* **Enable SYN attack protection**
* **Set SYN protection thresholds**
* **Set additional protections**

#### Enable SYN Attack Protection

The named value to enable SYN attack protection is located beneath the registry key: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters**.

**Value name:SynAttackProtect**

**Recommended value:** 2

**Valid values:** 0, 1, 2

**Description:** Causes TCP to adjust retransmission of SYN-ACKS. When you configure this value the connection responses timeout more quickly in the event of a SYN attack. A SYN attack is triggered when the values of **TcpMaxHalfOpen** or **TcpMaxHalfOpenRetried** are exceeded.

#### Set SYN Protection Thresholds

The following values determine the thresholds for which SYN protection is triggered. All of the keys and values in this section are under the registry key **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters**. These keys and values are:

* **Value name:TcpMaxPortsExhausted**

  **Recommended value:** 5

  **Valid values:** 0â65535

  **Description:** Specifies the threshold of TCP connection requests that must be exceeded before SYN flood protection is triggered.
* **Value name:TcpMaxHalfOpen**

  **Recommended value data:** 500

  **Valid values:** 100â65535

  **Description:** When **SynAttackProtect** is enabled, this value specifies the threshold of TCP connections in the SYN\_RCVD state. When **SynAttackProtect** is exceeded, SYN flood protection is triggered.
* **Value name:TcpMaxHalfOpenRetried**

  **Recommended value data:** 400

  **Valid values:** 80â65535

  **Description:** When **SynAttackProtect** is enabled, this value specifies the threshold of TCP connections in the SYN\_RCVD state for which at least one retransmission has been sent. When **SynAttackProtect** is exceeded, SYN flood protection is triggered.

#### Set Additional Protections

All the keys and values in this section are located under the registry key **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters**. These keys and values are:

* **Value name:TcpMaxConnectResponseRetransmissions**

  **Recommended value data:** 2

  **Valid values:** 0â255

  **Description:** Controls how many times a SYN-ACK is retransmitted before canceling the attempt when responding to a SYN request.
* **Value name:TcpMaxDataRetransmissions**

  **Recommended value data:** 2

  **Valid values:** 0â65535

  **Description:** Specifies the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data segment (not connection request segments) before aborting the connection.
* **Value name:EnablePMTUDiscovery**

  **Recommended value data:** 0

  **Valid values:** 0, 1

  **Description:** Setting this value to 1 (the default) forces TCP to discover the maximum transmission unit or largest packet size over the path to a remote host. An attacker can force packet fragmentation, which overworks the stack. Specifying 0 forces the MTU of 576 bytes for connections from hosts not on the local subnet.
* **Value name:KeepAliveTime**

  **Recommended value data:** 300000

  **Valid values:** 80â4294967295

  **Description:** Specifies how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact by sending a keep-alive packet.

#### Set NetBIOS Protections

All the keys and values in this section are located under the registry key **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters**. These keys and values are:

* **Value name:NoNameReleaseOnDemand**

  **Recommended value data:** 1

  **Valid values:** 0, 1

  **Description:** Specifies to not release the NetBIOS name of a computer when it receives a name-release request.

Use the values that are summarized in Table 1 for maximum protection.

**Table 1   Recommended Values**

| Value Name | Value (REG\_DWORD) |
| --- | --- |
| **SynAttackProtect** | 2 |
| **TcpMaxPortsExhausted** | 1 |
| **TcpMaxHalfOpen** | 500 |
| **TcpMaxHalfOpenRetried** | 400 |
| **TcpMaxConnectResponseRetransmissions** | 2 |
| **TcpMaxDataRetransmissions** | 2 |
| **EnablePMTUDiscovery** | 0 |
| **KeepAliveTime** | 300000 (5 minutes) |
| **NoNameReleaseOnDemand** | 1 |

## Protect Against ICMP Attacks

The named value in this section is under the registry key **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters**

**Value:EnableICMPRedirect**

**Recommended value data:** 0

**Valid values:** 0 (disabled), 1 (enabled)

**Description:** Modifying this registry value to 0 prevents the creation of expensive host routes when an ICMP redirect packet is received.

Use the value summarized in Table 2 for maximum protection:

**Table 2   Recommended Values**

| Value Name | Value (REG\_DWORD) |
| --- | --- |
| **EnableICMPRedirect** | 0 |

## Protect Against SNMP Attacks

The named value in this section is located under the registry key **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters**.

**Value:EnableDeadGWDetect**

**Recommended value data:** 0

**Valid values:** 0 (disabled), 1, (enabled)

**Description:** Prevents an attacker from forcing the switching to a secondary gateway

Use the value summarized in Table 3 for maximum protection.

**Table 3   Recommended Values**

| Value Name | Value (REG\_DWORD) |
| --- | --- |
| **EnableDeadGWDetect** | 0 |

## AFD.SYS Protections

The following keys specify parameters for the kernel mode driver Afd.sys. Afd.sys is used to support Windows sockets applications. All of the keys and values in this section are located under the registry key **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\AFD\Parameters**. These keys and values are:

* **Value:EnableDynamicBacklog**

  **Recommended value data:** 1

  **Valid values:** 0 (disabled), 1 (enabled)

  **Description:** Specifies AFD.SYS functionality to withstand large numbers of SYN\_RCVD connections efficiently. For more information, see "Internet Server Unavailable Because of Malicious SYN Attacks," at <https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;142641>.
* **Value name:MinimumDynamicBacklog**

  **Recommended value data:** 20

  **Valid values:** 0â4294967295

  **Description:** Specifies the minimum number of free connections allowed on a listening endpoint. If the number of free connections drops below this value, a thread is queued to create additional free connections
* **Value name:** MaximumDynamicBacklog

  **Recommended value data:** 20000

  **Valid values:** 0â4294967295

  **Description:** Specifies the maximum total amount of both free connections plus those in the SYN\_RCVD state.
* **Value name:DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta**

  **Recommended value data:** 10

  **Valid values:** 0â4294967295

  **Present by default:** No

  **Description:** Specifies the number of free connections to create when additional connections are necessary.

Use the values summarized in Table 4 for maximum protection.

**Table 4   Recommended Values**

| Value Name | Value (REG\_DWORD) |
| --- | --- |
| **EnableDynamicBacklog** | 1 |
| **MinimumDynamicBacklog** | 20 |
| **MaximumDynamicBacklog** | 20000 |
| **DynamicBacklogGrowthDelta** | 10 |

## Additional Protections

All of the keys and values in this section are located under the registry key **HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters**.

#### Protect Screened Network Details

Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to screen a network from incoming connections. An attacker can circumvent this screen to determine the network topology using IP source routing.

**Value:DisableIPSourceRouting**

**Recommended value data:** 1

**Valid values:** 0 (forward all packets), 1 (do not forward Source Routed packets), 2 (drop all incoming source routed packets).

**Description:** Disables IP source routing, which allows a sender to determine the route a datagram should take through the network.

#### Do Not Forward Packets Destined for Multiple Hosts

Multicast packets may be responded to by multiple hosts, resulting in responses that can flood a network.

**Value:EnableMulticastForwarding**

**Recommended value data:** 0

**Valid range:** 0 (false), 1 (true)

**Description:** The routing service uses this parameter to control whether or not IP multicasts are forwarded. This parameter is created by the Routing and Remote Access Service.

#### Only Firewalls Forward Packets Between Networks

A multi-homed server must not forward packets between the networks it is connected to. The obvious exception is the firewall.

**Value:IPEnableRouter**

**Recommended value data:** 0

**Valid range:** 0 (false), 1 (true)

**Description:** Setting this parameter to 1 (true) causes the system to route IP packets between the networks to which it is connected.

#### Mask Network Topology Details

The subnet mask of a host can be requested using ICMP packets. This disclosure of information by itself is harmless; however, the responses of multiple hosts can be used to build knowledge of the internal network.

**Value:EnableAddrMaskReply**

**Recommended value data:** 0

**Valid range:** 0 (false), 1 (true)

**Description:** This parameter controls whether the computer responds to an ICMP address mask request.

Use the values summarized in Table 5 for maximum protection

**Table 5   Recommended Values**

| Value Name | Value (REG\_DWORD) |
| --- | --- |
| **DisableIPSourceRouting** | 1 |
| **EnableMulticastForwarding** | 0 |
| **IPEnableRouter** | 0 |
| **EnableAddrMaskReply** | 0 |

## Pitfalls

When testing the changes of these values, test against the network volumes you expect in production. These settings modify the thresholds of what is considered normal and are deviating from the tested defaults. Some may be too narrow to support clients reliably if the connection speed from clients varies greatly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability Details

#### IP Source Route Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2379:

There is a remote code execution vulnerability in the TCP/IP Protocol driver that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for IP Source Route Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2379:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Systems are only at risk if IP Source Routing is enabled. IP Source Routing is disabled on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 systems.
* Enabling the Routing and Remote Access Service will enable IP Source Routing.  However, Routing and Remote Access is disabled on any affected operating system version.
* Attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in a denial of service condition. However remote code execution could be possible.

#### Workarounds for IP Source Route Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2379:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Block IP packets containing IP source route options 131 and 137 at the firewall:**

  IP network packets containing IP source route options 131 and 137 could be used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking network packets that meet these criteria at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this features is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).
* **Disable IP Source Routing**

  Disabling IP Source Routing will prevent an affected host from processing IP Source related packets that could allow an attacker to execute code. IP Source Routing processing can be disabled by following these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "**regedit32** " (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
  3. Add the DWORD Value: **DisableIPSourceRouting**. Set the value to **2**. This value disables IP Source Route processing. By default, this key does not exist.
  4. You must restart your system for this change to take effect.

For additional information on Disabling IP Source Routing please read the Additional Protections information listed in the MSDN Article: [How to Harden the TCP/IP Stack.](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa302363)

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
