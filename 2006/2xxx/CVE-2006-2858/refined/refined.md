Successful exploitation could lead to partial disclosure of sensitive information, partial modification of data, and partial denial of service.\n\nThe attack vector is remote, requiring no authentication, and has low complexity. An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious msgid parameter, for example:\n\nhttp://[target]/[path]/viewmsg.asp?msgid=-1%20union%20select%20epass,0,0,0,email,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0%20from%20thing+where+msgid=X",
