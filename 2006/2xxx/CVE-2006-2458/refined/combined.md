# libextractor: Two heap-based buffer overflows — GLSA **200605-14**

libextractor is vulnerable to two heap overflow vulnerabilities which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libextractor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.5.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.5.14** |

### Background

libextractor is a library used to extract metadata from arbitrary
files.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma has found two heap-based buffer overflows in
libextractor 0.5.13 and earlier: one of them occurs in the
asf\_read\_header function in the ASF plugin, and the other occurs in the
parse\_trak\_atom function in the Qt plugin.

### Impact

By enticing a user to open a malformed file using an application
that employs libextractor and its ASF or Qt plugins, an attacker could
execute arbitrary code in the context of the application running the
affected library.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libextractor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libextractor-0.5.14"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1081-1                    security@debian.org

Package        : libextractor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2458
BugTraq ID     : 18021

Luigi Auriemma discovered a buffer overflow in the processing of ASF
files in libextractor, a library to extract arbitrary meta-data from
files., which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.14-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
libextractor is a library which allows to search meta-data in different
file formats.
It's used in some programs and it's required for GnuNET
(http://gnunet.org).
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------
A] heap overflow in asfextractor
--------------------------------
The demux\_asf\_t structure is allocated when the plugin is launched,
subsequently is performed a call to asf\_read\_header which reads all the
header of the input file arriving to the handling (depending by the
file) of GUID\_ASF\_STREAM\_PROPERTIES and then CODEC\_TYPE\_AUDIO.
Here we have the arbitrary copying of an amount of data, specified by
the 32 bit numer called total\_size, from the ASF file to the wavex
buffer of 1024\*2 bytes.
The total\_size value is read from the same file and no checks are
performed on its size so is possible to cause a heap overflow.
From src/plugins/asfextractor.c:
static int asf\_read\_header(demux\_asf\_t \*this) {
...
total\_size = get\_le32(this);
stream\_data\_size = get\_le32(this);
stream\_id = get\_le16(this); /\* stream id \*/
get\_le32(this);
if (type == CODEC\_TYPE\_AUDIO) {
ext\_uint8\_t buffer[6];
readBuf (this, (ext\_uint8\_t \*) this->wavex, total\_size);
...
-------------------------------
B] heap overflow in qtextractor
-------------------------------
An heap overflow exists also in the plugin which handles the QT/MOV
files.
The problem is located in the parse\_trak\_atom function and is caused by
the allocation of a buffer using a specific amount of bytes chosen by
the attacker on which is then called memcpy using another amount of
data provided ever by the same input file.
From src/plugins/qtextractor.c:
static qt\_error parse\_trak\_atom (qt\_trak \*trak,
unsigned char \*trak\_atom) {
...
trak->stsd\_size = current\_atom\_size;
trak->stsd = realloc (trak->stsd, current\_atom\_size);
memset (trak->stsd, 0, trak->stsd\_size);
/\* awful, awful hack to support a certain type of stsd atom that
\* contains more than 1 video description atom \*/
if (BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 8]) == 1) {
/\* normal case \*/
memcpy (trak->stsd, &trak\_atom[i], current\_atom\_size);
hack\_adjust = 0;
} else {
/\* pathological case; take this route until a more definite
\* solution is found: jump over the first atom video
\* description atom \*/
/\* copy the first 12 bytes since those remain the same \*/
memcpy (trak->stsd, &trak\_atom[i], 12);
/\* skip to the second atom and copy it \*/
hack\_adjust = BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 0x0C]);
memcpy(trak->stsd + 12, &trak\_atom[i + 0x0C + hack\_adjust],
BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 0x0C + hack\_adjust]));
...

The bug in the ASF plugin has been fixed in revision 2827 while that in
QT in 2833.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
