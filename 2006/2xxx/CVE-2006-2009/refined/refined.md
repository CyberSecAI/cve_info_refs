Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to improper verification of the "rootagenda" parameter in the "agenda.php3" file. This parameter is used to include files, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is that the application allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code by specifying a URL in the "rootagenda" parameter. This can point to malicious files hosted on external servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to:
    *   Complete system compromise
    *   Data theft
    *   Website defacement
    *   Installation of malware
    *   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET/POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request (likely a POST request as shown in the example) to the vulnerable script "agenda.php3". The request includes the "rootagenda" parameter with a URL pointing to a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require prior authentication, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Requests:**  The attacker only needs a basic understanding of how to send HTTP requests with parameters.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specifically identified in phpMyAgenda version 3.0 Final and prior.
*   The server must have `register_globals` set to "On" for the exploit to work.
*   The provided example shows a POST data payload: `rootagenda=http://www.yourspace.com/yourscript.php?`
*   The report suggests that the application allows management and publication of events.
