And I don't know, why exactly there are two variables with the same varargs contents - one is analysed to get the proper length, one is used for formatting. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c1)  Stanislav Brabec    2006-05-17 11:39:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 65665](attachment.cgi?id=65665 "dia-message-format.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=65665&action=edit "dia-message-format.patch") [[review]](review?bug=342111&attachment=65665) dia-message-format.patch  Proposed patch, which seems to fix the bug. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c2)  Hans de Goede    2006-05-20 12:05:04 UTC  ``` Hi,  I'm the Fedora dia package maintainer, as such I've taken a look into this. This is a classic format string vulnerability. At a first glance the fix seems correct and after carefull inspection the fix still seems correct.  As such I'm pushing new Fedora Extras packages with this fix included. Thanks Stanislav.   ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c3)  Alec Berryman    2006-05-20 12:31:06 UTC  ``` This is CVE-2006-2480. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c4)  Hans de Goede    2006-05-23 07:57:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 66038](attachment.cgi?id=66038 "Patch fixing many format string vulnerabilities") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=66038&action=edit "Patch fixing many format string vulnerabilities") [[review]](review?bug=342111&attachment=66038) Patch fixing many format string vulnerabilities  This has lead me to taking a closer look at the use of formatstrings in dia.  Yesterday I checked all the uses of: dia's message* funcs g_print g_message g_warning dia_assert_true   And reported my findings to John Bressers (from RedHat) and Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.cz>. John has assigned CVE-2006-2453 for the additonal problems I found.  This morning I also checked (and found issues and fixed) all the uses of: gtk_message_dialog_new gtk_message_dialog_format_secondary_text g_error  I've attached a patch fixing all issues I found. New as of this morning are the changes / fixes to: app/display.c app/filedlg.c  Regards,  Hans   p.s.  There could still be other vararg printf like functions in dia which I didn't check. I'm in no way claiming this work is complete. With that said I'm not planning on doing any more auditing for printf like functions in dia in the near future. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c5)  Hans de Goede    2006-05-23 20:49:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 66086](attachment.cgi?id=66086 "Patch fixing format string vulnerabilities") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=66086&action=edit "Patch fixing format string vulnerabilities") [[review]](review?bug=342111&attachment=66086) Patch fixing format string vulnerabilities  I was a bit short on time when I mailed my previous mail on this, so I didn't test (I didn't even compile) the patch. It turns out my previous patch contained one cut and paste error causing compilation to fail.  The attached patch fixes this and has been tested.  Also Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.cz> has found one potential issue missed:  --- plug-ins/xfig/xfig-export.c +++ plug-ins/xfig/xfig-export.c @@ -263,7 +263,7 @@  figWarn(XfigRenderer *renderer, int warning)   {    if (renderer->warnings[warning]) { -    message_warning(renderer->warnings[warning]); +    message_warning("%s", renderer->warnings[warning]);      renderer->warnings[warning] = NULL;    } }  Luckily this one isn't a security issue though. There is only one type of warning in the renderer->warnings array and this always gets initialised to: _("No more user-definable colors - using black") and is never changed, so this isn't a problem. Still I missed it :|  Notice that it still might be a good idea to fix this too  and that the attached patch doesn't fix this (The above diff does). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c6)  Lars Clausen    2006-05-26 19:51:32 UTC  ``` Patch applied, thank you for your investigation!  ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=342111#c7)  Hans Breuer    2006-05-27 13:03:44 UTC  ``` Also applied to HEAD:  2006-05-27  Hans Breuer  <hans@breuer.org>  	* app/app_procs.c app/display.c app/filedlg.c app/interface.c 	  app/load_save.c app/sheets.c lib/dia_image.c lib/message.c 	  plug-ins/python/diamodule.c plug-ins/python/pydia-error.c 	  plug-ins/wmf/wmf.cpp : fixed format string vulnerability on HEAD 	as well.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-25 04:36:13 UTC  ``` /usr/ilb/libmisc.la has libdir='/lib' not /usr/lib as it should. Consequently kdeadmin (maybe other packages as well) fail to find libmisc.a (they look in /lib). See "kde3 install" thread on gentoo-user and "Kde build fails - can't find library '/lib/libmisc.la'" thread on gentoo-newbies for user reports. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-03-25 15:07:24 UTC  ``` Fixed in 4.0.2-r1 of shadow. ``` |  |

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

# Dia: Format string vulnerabilities — GLSA **200606-03**

Format string vulnerabilities in Dia may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/dia** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.95.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.95.1** |

### Background

Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program.

### Description

KaDaL-X discovered a format string error within the handling of
filenames. Hans de Goede also discovered several other format
string errors in the processing of dia files.

### Impact

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted file, a remote
attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code
with the rights of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Dia users should upgrade to the latest available version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/dia-0.95.1"
```
