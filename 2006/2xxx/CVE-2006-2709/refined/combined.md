## Secure Elements Class 5 AVR server fails to validate source address of messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#919345

Original Release Date: 2006-05-30 | Last Revised: 2006-06-07

---

### Overview

The Secure Elements Class 5 AVR server fails to validate the source address of messages it receives. This may allow an attacker to forge messages to the server.

### Description

| **Class 5 AVR**  Secure Elements Class 5 AVR (Automated Vulnerability Remediation) is a security product that monitors and enforces security policies on network assets. Class 5 AVR is now known as C5 EVM (Enterprise Vulnerability Management). The Class 5 AVR software includes both server and client components.**Class 5 AVR client**The Class 5 AVR client listens on 60000/udp and an additional tcp port. This client receives commands sent by the Class 5 AVR server.**Class 5 AVR server**The Class 5 AVR server is available as an appliance or as software that runs on commodity hardware. The Class 5 AVR server contains information about network assets, vulnerabilities, and remediation history.**The problem**The Class 5 AVR server fails to validate the source address of messages it receives. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to forge client messages. This can allow an attacker to intercept communications initiated by the server. An attacker may also be able to alter the client information stored by the server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or patch**This issue has been resolved in C5 EVM 2.8.1. |
