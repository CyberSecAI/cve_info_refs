  "CVE-2006-2111": {
    "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Windows because the MHTML protocol handler incorrectly interprets the MHTML URL redirections that could potentially bypass Internet Explorer domain restrictions. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.",
    "root_cause": "The MHTML protocol handler incorrectly interprets MHTML URL redirections, specifically HTTP server-side redirects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect interpretation of MHTML URL redirections.",
      "Failure to enforce Internet Explorer domain restrictions."
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure, allowing an attacker to potentially read data from another Internet Explorer domain.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web page.",
      "Clicking a link in an email or instant message.",
      "Compromised or malicious website hosting the crafted content"
    ],
