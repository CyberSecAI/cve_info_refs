  "CVE-2006-2409": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Raydium game engine, including buffer overflows, format string vulnerability, and null pointer dereference. These issues can be triggered remotely on both server and client applications depending on the vulnerability.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "name": "Buffer overflow in raydium_log and raydium_console_line_add",
        "description": "The `raydium_log` function uses `sprintf` to format log messages into a fixed-size buffer of 255 bytes (RAYDIUM_MAX_NAME_LEN). User-controlled input exceeding this limit results in a buffer overflow. The `raydium_console_line_add` function also utilizes `sprintf` with a similar fixed-size buffer and is vulnerable to the same issue.",
        "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) could be possible due to the buffer overflows.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote, via network packets sent to either the server or client.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network packets to the server or client."
      },
      {
        "name": "Format string vulnerability in raydium_log",
        "description": "The `raydium_log` function passes the formatted string to `raydium_console_line_add` without proper sanitization, leading to a format string vulnerability.",
         "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE) or denial of service (DoS).",
        "attack_vector": "Remote, via network packets sent to either the server or client.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network packets to the server or client."
      },
       {
        "name": "NULL function pointer dereference in raydium_network_netcall_exec",
        "description": "The `raydium_network_netcall_exec` function retrieves a function pointer from the `raydium_network_netcall_func` array based on a packet type. This array is initialized with NULL pointers. If a packet with an unhandled type is received (e.g., 0xff), the function attempts to call a NULL pointer resulting in a crash.",
        "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote, via network packets sent to either the server or client.",
         "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network packets to the server or client."
      },
      {
          "name": "Buffer overflow and invalid memory access in raydium_network_read",
          "description": "The function `raydium_network_read` contains buffer overflows when writing server names and info into `raydium_network_server_list`, an array with 32 elements. It also has an invalid memory access vulnerability when reading client names if the server sends a client ID larger than 8, which is the size of `raydium_network_name` array.",
          "impact": "Possible remote code execution (RCE) due to buffer overflows and denial of service (DoS) due to invalid memory access.",
          "attack_vector": "Remote, via network packets sent to clients.",
          "required_capabilities":"Attacker must be able to send network packets to clients."
      }
    ],
    "additional_info": "The advisory mentions the issues were found in Raydium SVN revisions up to 309 and that some issues have been fixed in later SVN versions, while others remain unfixed.",
    "remediation": "Apply the latest available patches and updates for Raydium, ensuring all mentioned vulnerabilities are addressed."
