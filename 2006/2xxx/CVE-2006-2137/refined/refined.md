      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_181b4ea4_20250125_221453.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion.",

        "Remote File Inclusion"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is in the `master.php` file. An attacker can inject a URL via the `root_path` parameter to include a malicious file."

      "source": "www.openphpnuke.com_914b1120_20250125_221448.html",
       "root_cause": "A vulnerability exists due to a combination of PHP settings and OpenPHPNuke settings, particularly regarding `register_globals` and `allow_url_fopen`. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject malicious code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of URL parameters.",
        "Remote File Inclusion due to weak PHP settings (`register_globals` and `allow_url_fopen`)."

      "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to defacement of the website and potentially allows the attacker to upload additional malicious files for future attacks. The vulnerability can be used for arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the URL parameter `root_path` in `master.php`.",
         "The vulnerability can be exploited if `register_globals` is enabled in PHP configuration or if `allow_url_fopen` is enabled and the application does not validate input."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make a HTTP request to the target system, and the target system has to have vulnerable settings (`register_globals` enabled or `allow_url_fopen` enabled). "
