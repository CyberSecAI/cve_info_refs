The content relates to CVE-2006-2934.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided text:

**Nature of Vulnerability:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can crash the system by sending a malformed SCTP packet.

**Root Cause:**

*   The `sctp_packet` structure within the netfilter SCTP connection tracking module uses a variable called `newconntrack` as an argument.
*   When an SCTP packet with no chunks is received, the `newconntrack` variable contains an unexpected value.
*   This unexpected value is then used to look up a pointer in an array of timeouts. Because the value is incorrect, the pointer dereference leads to a crash.

**Attack Vector:**

*   Sending a specially crafted SCTP packet (containing no chunks) to a vulnerable system.

**Impact:**

*   System crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Linux kernel versions prior to 2.6.16.23 and 2.6.17.3.
*   Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 (CM 1.x to CM 3.x)
*   Avaya Messaging Storage Server (3.0 and greater)
*   Avaya CCS/SES (All)
