# Security flaw in RealVNC 4.1.1

by [Steve Wiseman](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/author/steve-wiseman/) on May 8, 2006 · [4 comments](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/2006/05/security-flaw-in-realvnc-411/#comments)

in [Windows](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/category/windows/)

.

Update (June 2006): We have created a vulnerability testing tool . It is free, and can be [downloaded from here](http://www.intelliadmin.com/Downloads.htm)

Update (05/10/2006) – We have contacted the RealVNC team. Quickly they released a new version that fixed the security issue. If you are running WinVNC 4.1.1 I suggest you get to [www.realvnc.com](http://www.realvnc.com) today and update your software.

Update (05/08/2006) – We have installed RealVNC 4.1.1 on as many fresh computers as possible. We wanted to make sure this is a real problem – indeed it is. Every single time we were able to access the machine without a valid password. We are still trying to see what is different about our viewer that exposes this flaw.

We are currently developing a new product that would allow users to remotely install VNC, and manage current VNC installations.

Our viewer is totally 100% new code that we created from the VNC spec and not from the open source Real VNC source tree.

I got a big surprise today when I was testing the viewer code: I was able to view the remote machine without the proper password!

It had to be some type of mistake, so I installed Real VNC 4.1.1 on a test machine:

![](http://www.intelliadmin.com/images/VNCSecurityFlaw1a.jpg)

I set the password to a really huge value that I could not have possibly left in our code by accident. Got back on the development machine and clicked connect:

![](http://www.intelliadmin.com/images/VNCSecurityFlaw2a.jpg)

Instantly I had a view of the remote machine!

I started to wonder how widespread this flaw was so I downloaded TightVNC, and UltraVNC. They are immune. Both of them reject my connection right away.

Then I downloaded RealVNC 4.0 and installed it on another fresh test machine. Same thing as Tight and Ultra – I get disconnected right away.

So it looks like a flaw is in the current RealVNC 4.1.1 authentication process. I am not going to give any clues as to what it is until I can figure it out totally, and promptly let the RealVNC team know so they can resolve the issue.

Please note that I have only tested this on the windows versions of the above software.

Hi,

I had this problem on Real VNC 4.1.2, although you say it is only on 4.1.1

Are we sure it’s now OK on 4.1.3 ?

Hello Steve,

This is a really old flaw. If you have the latest VNC you are fine.

How can I use the free VNC flaw test tool against a machine on which the VNC service runs on a non-standard port?

Hello Andre,

Our tool can only check on the default port. By now…there are many tools out there that can do the same, and are probably better than this free tool…such as Nessus, It has a good plugin for this.

Check it out at:

## RealVNC Server does not validate client authentication method

#### Vulnerability Note VU#117929

Original Release Date: 2006-05-16 | Last Revised: 2008-02-26

---

### Overview

The RealVNC Server fails to properly authenticate clients. This may allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the VNC server.

### Description

| **The** **Virtual Network Computing** **(VNC) Protocol**  According to [RealVNC](http://www.realvnc.com/howitworks.html), "The VNC protocol is a simple protocol for remote access to graphical user interfaces."**RealVNC**RealVNC is an implementation of the VNC protocol. **The Problem**The RealVNC Server fails to properly authenticate clients. When a RealVNC client connects to a RealVNC server, the server provides a list of supported authentication methods. By design, the client then selects a method from the list. Due to an implementation flaw, if the client specifies that no (null) authentication should be used, the server accepts this method and authenticates the client, whether or not null authentication was offered by the server.Note that exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain access to a system running RealVNC server. If the RealVNC server runs with administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue is corrected in RealVNC version [4.1.2](http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/release-notes.html), RealVNC Personal Edition [4.2.3](http://www.realvnc.com/products/personal/4.2/release-notes.html), and RealVNC Enterprise Edition [4.2.3](http://www.realvnc.com/products/enterprise/4.2/release-notes.html). Refer to the RealVNC [Downloads site](http://www.realvnc.com/download.html) to get a patched version. |
| --- |

| **Prompt Local Users to Accept Connections**Until updates can be applied, selecting the Prompt local user to accept connections option may prevent attackers from gaining a VNC session by exploiting this vulnerability. See the [authentication](http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/winvnc.html#Security) section of the RealVNC user guide for more information. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I also looked for the source or a patch, but found non of them.
So I started looking for such a bug in the sources.

The following exploit for the client makes the realvnc server
bypass any VNC authentification:

     // Inform the server of our decision
     if (secType != secTypeInvalid) {
       os->writeU8(secType);

A exploit for the java client could by implemented analogous.

The fix for the server is trivial (check, that the client response
is in the list of allowed security types):

--- rfb/SConnection.old 2006-05-13 21:58:56.000000000 +0200

As these files are shared between Windows and Unix versions, they apply to
both of them (I tested only with the Linux version).

I have not seen any source of version 4.1.2 and not tested the binary version,
so I do not know, if this is the same problem, which was fixed in 4.1.2.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Download RAW [message](?l=full-disclosure&m=114768344111131&q=mbox) or [body](?l=full-disclosure&m=114768344111131&q=raw)]

Rumors of this bug began spreading on Slashdot and other sites, thanks
to Steve Wiseman of intelliadmin.com who serendipitously discovered it
while writing a VNC client. At first it was only a rumor, as Steve's
site gave scant details and he himself was surprised such a huge hole
could possibly exist in such a widely deployed product. Here are the
results of my research into this rumor.

In the interests of full disclosure, the following message details a
critical vulnerability in RealVNC's authentication protocol. Using the
following method, it is trivial to gain access to any RealVNC server
without knowing the password. This allows full control of the target
machine, with privilege levels equalling that of the user under which
the RealVNC server runs - often full Administrator access on Windows
desktops.

RealVNC is a widely used program which "makes it possible to view and
fully-interact with one computer from any other computer or mobile
device anywhere on the Internet." ([www.realvnc.com](http://www.realvnc.com)) As documented in
rfbproto.pdf by Tristan Richardson, the RFB (remote frame buffer)
protocol performs an initial handshake which allows clients and
servers to negotiate appropriate authentication measures. There are
several methods of authentication, including the standard DES
Challenge-Response, as well as an option to disable authentication
completely. Due to an incorrect implementation, clients are able to
force the server to disable authentication, and allow login without a
password.

Technical details:

1) Server sends its version, "RFB 003.008\n"
2) Client replies with its version, "RFB 003.008\n"
3) Server sends 1 byte which is equal to the number of security types offered
3a) Server sends an array of bytes which indicate security types offered
4) Client replies with 1 byte, chosen from the array in 3a, to select
the security type
5) The handshake, if requested, is performed, followed by "0000" from the server

In RealVNC 4.1.1 and possibly prior versions which implement RFB
003.008 (though not RealVNC 4.0), the server does NOT perform a check
to determine if the byte sent by the client in step 4 has actually
been offered by the server in step 3a. In effect, authentication is
moved from the server side to the client side. It is possible to force
your client to simply request "Type 1 - None" as the security type,
and gain access to the server without having to go through the time
consuming and cumbersome password entry field.

Here is a typical packet dump:

Server -> Client: 52 46 42 20 30 30 33 2e 30 30 38 0a <- Server version
Client -> Server: 52 46 42 20 30 30 33 2e 30 30 38 0a <- Client version
Server -> Client: 01 02 <- One field follows... and that field is 02
(DES Challenge)
Client -> Server: 01 <- Ahh, the lovely 1 byte exploit! Beautiful, isn't it?
Server -> Client: 00 00 00 00 <-- Authenticated!

Modifying the RealVNC client to exploit this is simple, and other
clients can be modified as well. Such exercises, however, are best
left to the skilled reader. To all admins, you are reminded to run
services like these behind firewalls and through SSH tunnels.

And now a very important message...

RealVNC is distributed under the GNU General Public License. As such,
the complete source code of RealVNC *must* be freely distributed. When
RealVNC (the company) received notice of this flaw in their software,
they were quite prompt in patching it. Such action is normally worthy
of praise. Yet, in this case, RealVNC immediately took down the source
code to their software. While this was probably done out of fear
rather than malice, I believe it violates both the spirit and law of
the GNU GPL. As we can see from the above, it is also not beneficial
to security. I was able to rediscover this flaw using only binaries,
and a little thought. Allowing for the benefit of doubt, I posted to
the RealVNC mailing list, congratulating them on patching the bug so
quickly and asking when the source code would be released. I received
one reply from another user, agreeing that he would like to see the
source, as it is under GPL. Upon returning the next day to check if
there were any more replies, I was surprised to see the entire mailing
list was deleted along with its archives. This is unfortunate, and it
clearly neither prevents discussion nor promotes security.

Best,
James Evans

# VNC Flaw – Proof of concept

by [Steve Wiseman](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/author/steve-wiseman/) on May 11, 2006 · [0 comments](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/2006/05/vnc-flaw-proof-of-concept/#comments)

in [Windows](http://www.intelliadmin.com/index.php/category/windows/)

.

Update (June 2006): We have created a vulnerability testing tool . It is free, and can be [downloaded from here](http://www.intelliadmin.com/downloads.htm)

*Update 5/12/2006: We contacted the RealVNC team with our findings. They were able to verify the flaw, and release a fix within only a few short hours. I would highly suggest [downloading 4.1.2](http://www.realvnc.com/) if you are running RealVNC on any internet facing computers – Steve*

In our previous post [I discussed a flaw in VNC](http://www.intelliadmin.com/blog/2006/05/security-flaw-in-realvnc-411.html) that we discovered by accident. It essentially allows you to access a host running Real VNC 4 without knowing the password.

I have put together a proof of concept application (VNC Flaw Test). If you [visit this page](http://www.intelliadmin.com/Downloads.htm) from the server or machine running VNC, it will attempt to connect back and display a snapshot. If it says your safe – then hey your safe. If not, you got to wonder how many million people have this installed and they have a wide open security flaw.

Now it is still possible we are wrong, since every machine we have had the chance to test has been touched by our software. Try it and see if you are vulnerable – and remember you need to browse to the testing page \*from\* the machine running VNC, and this machine and VNC port has to be accessible from the Internet.

The client chooses the security type, so they can pass in "None" to the switch statement. is_allowed_security_type() now prevents that.

Thank you very much for bringing this to oss-security!

On oss-security, we need a description of the vulnerability, not just a note that some vulnerability existed.

The release notes mention:

"The vulnerability was reported by Dane Bouchie and Travis Wise."

Dane and/or Travis, maybe you can provide the missing detail here?

The fix commit appears to be:

Add sanity check for chosen security type
<https://github.com/any1/neatvnc/commit/cc71650a69abc2573a0d96d082409d2468802d47>

Skimming it, I see it increases the size of buf in on_version_message() from 3 to 32 security types.  That function is also split in two and otherwise refactored.  A number of "security->types[security->n++]"
lines got replaced with ADD_SECURITY_TYPE(), which has an assert() against the new maximum.  There were 4 of those lines, so I can see how a buffer for 3 could be too small.  So there was a bug.  However, none of this looks like attacker-controlled input, or is it?  Now, even without attacker-controlled input an out-of-bounds write is undefined behavior, so theoretically could result in an exploitable vulnerability via some other correctly processed input, but was there any analysis whether it commonly or realistically does in this case?

I see the commit also adds an is_allowed_security_type() check to the beginning of on_security_message().  However, the rest of that function only has a switch statement covering a few known security types and:

        default:
                security_handshake_failed(client, NULL,
                                "Unsupported security type");

The action on failing the added pre-check is almost the same.  So I don't immediately see how not pre-checking could have been problematic.

Maybe I'm missing some bigger issue also fixed by those changes?

Don't get me wrong, fixing a bug and defensive programming is great, but we also need the security impact documented.

Alexander

# some details regarding CVE-2022-24422 / iDRAC VNC authentication

---

*From*: christian mock <cm () coretec at>

*Date*: Fri, 13 May 2022 13:40:45 +0200

---

```
The Dell advisory is a bit low on details, so:

The vulnerability is really just CVE-2006-2369 / CVE-2006-2450, but
wrapped in TLS (we're in the 2020s, our auth bypasses are secure now!)

That means that your vuln scanner might or might not detect it, Nessus
for example does, but Nexpose apparently doesn't.

It also means that metasploit's "realvnc_41_bypass" is not directly
usable, you need to use your favorite TLS wrapper with it.

I have no POC code, I actually stumbled upon it with Nessus and
exploited it with metasploit and some socat mixed in. That's all that
there is to it...

Have fun,

cm.
