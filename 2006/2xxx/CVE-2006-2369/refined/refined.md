        "Content": "The RealVNC Server fails to properly authenticate clients. This may allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the VNC server.\n\nThe RealVNC Server fails to properly authenticate clients. When a RealVNC client connects to a RealVNC server, the server provides a list of supported authentication methods. By design, the client then selects a method from the list. Due to an implementation flaw, if the client specifies that no (null) authentication should be used, the server accepts this method and authenticates the client, whether or not null authentication was offered by the server.\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain access to a system running RealVNC server. If the RealVNC server runs with administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.\n\nAn attacker can bypass authentication by forcing the server to use no authentication. The vulnerability exists because the server does not check if the client requested security type was actually offered by the server. The client can request \"Type 1 - None\" and gain access without providing a password."

         "Content": "Root cause of vulnerability: The RealVNC server fails to properly validate the authentication method requested by the client.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The server does not verify if the client-selected authentication type was offered by the server during the initial handshake, allowing the client to force a 'None' authentication type.\n\nImpact of exploitation:  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the system running the vulnerable RealVNC server.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack occurs over the network by a malicious VNC client sending an authentication bypass request during the initial handshake. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the VNC service and have knowledge of the authentication bypass."

        "ID": "CVE-2006-2369",
        "Content": "The vulnerability is a critical authentication bypass in RealVNC 4.1.1 and possibly prior versions using RFB 003.008. During the initial handshake, the server sends a list of supported security types to the client. However, the server does not check if the security type the client selects is one that was offered. A malicious client can force the server to use “Type 1 - None” authentication, bypassing the password check and granting full access to the target machine with the same privileges as the VNC server user, which is often administrator on Windows."

        "Content": "The vulnerability is really just CVE-2006-2369 / CVE-2006-2450, but wrapped in TLS.  That means that your vuln scanner might or might not detect it, Nessus for example does, but Nexpose apparently doesn't.  It also means that metasploit's 'realvnc_41_bypass' is not directly usable, you need to use your favorite TLS wrapper with it."

The client can force the server to disable authentication, allowing login without a password.\n*   Exploitation: The malicious client requests 'Type 1 - None' as security type.\n*   Patch Information: Fixed in RealVNC versions 4.1.2 and later."
