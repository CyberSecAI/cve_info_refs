| [Description](#c0)  Shahar Goldin    2002-03-27 00:30:03 UTC  ``` emerge --unmerge kde-libs for example should unmerge anything that depends on kde-libs like, kde-base and koffice and so on  this is in the far future and non-critical and stuff ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Leif Brown    2002-05-01 09:28:42 UTC  ``` Seems like this would conflict with USE "-XXX" functionality, and the cleaning of false dependencies.  (kde depends on kdetoys, for instance.)  Even worse, if a package listed a false dependency in some versions but not others.  And packages with joint ownership of files...  Maybe a shade of gray between "dependent" and "independant" -- an "optional" tag?   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Shahar Goldin    2002-05-02 12:26:45 UTC  ``` hmm KDE is a special case since it isn't really an ebuild, it just calls all the  kde components in the right order, if I recall correctly. unmergeing kde should remove all the components that emerge kde installed  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Arne Brix    2002-09-29 08:52:55 UTC  ``` this would really be a nice feature. it could be even better together with automatic updating of packages, whose usevars have changed and packages which are not in world as well as removal of packages which are not needed anymore  ideally after an  emerge -u world --apply-all-changes-or-something  your packages would be the same as if you would have done reinstall with your current configuration. it would be a bit like  emerge -eu world together whith removal of unneeded packages, but much much faster, doing no unneccessary work.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-22 22:57:06 UTC  ``` emerge depclean does this... >= portage-2.0.41 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  niecheng    2009-12-18 01:24:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1358#c4)) > emerge depclean > does this... >= portage-2.0.41   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : none or remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2656 CVE-2006-2193
Debian Bug     : 369819

Several problems have been discovered in the TIFF library.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2006-2193

    SuSE discovered a buffer overflow in the conversion of TIFF files
    into PDF documents which could be exploited when tiff2pdf is used
    e.g. in a printer filter.

CVE-2006-2656

    The tiffsplit command from the TIFF library contains a buffer
    overflow in the commandline handling which could be exploited when
    the program is executed automatically on unknown filenames.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-7woody2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.2-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libTIFF: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200607-03**

libTIFF contains buffer overflows that could result in arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.2-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

### Description

A buffer overflow has been found in the t2p\_write\_pdf\_string function
in tiff2pdf, which can been triggered with a TIFF file containing a
DocumentName tag with UTF-8 characters. An additional buffer overflow
has been found in the handling of the parameters in tiffsplit.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted TIFF
file, resulting in the possible execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
