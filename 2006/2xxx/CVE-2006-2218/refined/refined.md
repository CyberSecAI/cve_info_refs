Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-2218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper exception handling within Microsoft Internet Explorer. Specifically, objects within IE can register exception handlers that do not correctly handle certain error conditions, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of these faulty exception handlers to corrupt memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker.
- **Inadequate Exception Handling:** The underlying weakness lies in the fact that some objects' exception handlers within Internet Explorer don't manage all conditions and can cause memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit enables a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Application Faults:** As a side effect of the fix (removing exception handlers from IE), exceptions from objects that do not handle their own exception can now result in application faults, potentially causing Internet Explorer to fail.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious websites with specially crafted content designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:**  Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-content-hosting websites.
- **Email/Instant Messenger:** While not directly exploitable through email previews, attackers can lure users to visit malicious websites through links in emails/IM messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without needing any prior authentication or access to the victim's system.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on social engineering techniques to persuade users to visit malicious websites.
- **Web Hosting:** Attackers need a platform (their own server, compromised sites, etc.) to host the exploit and deliver the malicious code via websites.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-021. This update removes exception handlers from Internet Explorer, preventing the memory corruption vulnerability but potentially leading to application faults when objects don't handle their own exceptions properly.
- Workarounds include disabling Active Scripting or setting high security levels in Internet Explorer, which block known attack vectors but reduce website functionality.
- The advisory notes that the vulnerability is also related to CVE-2006-1992, which is a non-exploitable variant which only results in an application crash.

In summary, CVE-2006-2218 is a critical vulnerability arising from improper exception handling in Internet Explorer that allows remote code execution by exploiting memory corruption. It highlights the importance of robust error handling mechanisms in software and the potential dangers of browsing untrusted websites.
