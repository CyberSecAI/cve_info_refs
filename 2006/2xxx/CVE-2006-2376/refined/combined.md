# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Graphics Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2376

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Graphics Rendering Engine because of the way that it handles Windows Metafile (WMF) images. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted WMF image that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or opened a specially crafted attachment in e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for Graphics Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2376:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. Also, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites, may contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

#### Workarounds for Graphics Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2376:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Graphics Rendering Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2376:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A vulnerability exists in the way that the Graphics Rendering Engine handles specially crafted WMF images that could allow arbitrary code to be executed.

**What is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?**

A Windows Metafile (WMF) image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314) or visit the [MSDN Library Web site.](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms536391.aspx)

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or a specially crafted attachment in e-mail and then persuading the user to visit the page or open the attachment. If the user visited the page or opened the attachment, the attacker could cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**Does this vulnerability affect image formats other than Windows Metafile (WMF)?**

The only image format that is affected is the Windows Metafile (WMF) format. It is possible, however, that an attacker could rename the file name extension of a WMF file to that of a different image format. In this situation, it is likely that the Graphics Rendering Engine would detect and render the file as a WMF image, which could allow exploitation.

**If I block files that use the .wmf file name extension, can this protect me against attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

No. The Graphics Rendering Engine does not determine file types by the file name extensions that they use. Therefore, if an attacker alters the file name extension of a WMF file, the Graphics Rendering Engine could still render the file in a way that could exploit the vulnerability.

**Are Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 do not contain the affected component.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows Metafile (WMF) images are handled.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**How does this vulnerability relate to the vulnerabilities that were corrected by MS06-001?**

Both vulnerabilities were in the Graphics Rendering Engine. However, this update addresses a new vulnerability that was not addressed as part of MS06-001. MS06-001 does not help protect against the vulnerability that is discussed in this bulletin, and does not address this new vulnerability.
