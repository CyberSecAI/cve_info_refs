{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `page` parameter in `index.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an `eval()` statement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHP Code Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization",
      "Use of `eval()` with unsanitized input"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary PHP code, allowing them to execute commands, include remote files, or perform other malicious actions on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request with a malicious `page` parameter."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or specific position is required.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in `index.php` at line 126. The vulnerable code is `eval(\"? >\" . $output);`.  The exploit example demonstrates how a remote attacker can include arbitrary PHP files using the `page` parameter. The advisory also includes a link to a PoC exploit, and Google dorks to identify vulnerable installations."
