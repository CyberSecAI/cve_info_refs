Package: knowledgetree
Version: 2.0.7-1
Severity: critical

Hey,

/etc/knowledgetree/environment.php is world-readable by default. It is
supposed to contain (amongst other things) the username and password for
the KnowledgeTree database.

Cc:'d to security@debian.org just in case they care (the package is only
in Sid, but maybe some other "related" packages are worth auditing).
