    "ID": "CVE-2006-2875",
    "content": "The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Quake 3 engine. Specifically, the `CL_ParseDownload` function, responsible for handling download commands from the server, reads a size value from the server message and uses it to copy data into a buffer. A malicious server can send a crafted message with a large size value, leading to a buffer overflow on the client side.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking on the size value received from the server before copying data into a fixed-size buffer in the `CL_ParseDownload` function.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Buffer Overflow: The `MSG_ReadData` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer based on a size value provided by the server without proper validation.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Remote Code Execution: By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite critical data like return addresses, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the client machine. This can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable client.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Network Attack: A malicious server can send a specially crafted `svc_download` message to the client during the game, triggering the buffer overflow.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Malicious Server: The attacker needs to control or operate a malicious server that can send the crafted `svc_download` message to vulnerable clients.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- The vulnerability is present in Quake 3 versions <= 1.32c, Icculus.org Quake 3 <= revision 795, and possibly other derived projects using the Quake 3 engine.\n- The huffman compression in the engine can be used to bypass the 16384-byte limit for packets, allowing for larger overflows.\n- The `svc_download` can be sent to the client at any time, even immediately after the connection handshake, which means that clients are vulnerable from the moment they connect to a server.",
