  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2386",
      "root_cause": "An unchecked buffer in the Windows Address Book (WAB) functions within Outlook Express.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack: Hosting a malicious website that contains a specially crafted .wab file, which the user must open.",
        "Email attack: Sending a specially crafted .wab file to a user, which the user must open.",
        "Local file system/Network share: Opening a specially crafted .wab file from the local file system or a network share."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .wab file. They also need to convince a user to open this file.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in a component of Outlook Express, specifically within the Windows Address Book. Successful exploitation could give the attacker the same user rights as the logged-on user. Systems where users have fewer rights are less impacted. The update modifies how Outlook Express validates the length of a field when using .wab files before passing it to the allocated buffer."
