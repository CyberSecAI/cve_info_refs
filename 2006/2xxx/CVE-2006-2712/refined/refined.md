Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** The Secure Elements Class 5 AVR client and server fail to enforce integrity of message digests.

**Root Cause:** The Class 5 AVR client and server do not properly validate the integrity of message digests included with incoming messages.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Message Digest Verification:** The client and server do not verify the message digests, making them vulnerable to message manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Message Replay and Modification:** An attacker can modify messages and replay them to the vulnerable client and server.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without the need for local access.
*   **No Key Requirement:** Attackers can achieve this without needing to know any encryption keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Communication:** The attack is performed over the network, targeting the UDP port 60000, and an additional TCP port used by the Class 5 AVR client and the communication between the server and the client.
*   **Message Interception:** An attacker would need to intercept messages sent between the client and server.
*   **Message Modification:**  The attacker then modifies the message content and can replay it to the vulnerable client or server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the Class 5 AVR server and client.
*   **Message Knowledge:** The attacker should have knowledge about the structure of messages to be able to modify and replay them.

**Additional details:**
*   The client and server components of the Class 5 AVR are affected.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in C5 EVM 2.8.1 by implementing a check where the digest of the incoming message is calculated by the receiver and compared with the digest from the sender.
