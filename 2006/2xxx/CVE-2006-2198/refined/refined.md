{
  "CVE-2006-2198": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how OpenOffice.org handles Basic macros embedded within documents.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of Basic macros.",
      "Lack of confirmation prompt before executing macros."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could embed malicious Basic code into a document. Upon opening, this code would execute without user confirmation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the document.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document containing the malicious macro.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious document with an embedded Basic macro and deliver it to the victim."
  }
}
