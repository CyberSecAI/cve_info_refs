How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hendrik Weimer discovered that specially crafted web requests can
cause awstats, a powerful and featureful web server log analyzer, to
execute arbitrary commands.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your awstats package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Other people typically interested in web analytics are web hosters both as a service for customers and an early-warning system in case of trouble. A graphical log file analyzer like AWStats transforms the rather dull log file content into a more comprehensible representation.  AWStats aims to satisfy both user groups. The Perl script can be run from the command line to produce static HTML pages or run as a CGI application. Although AWStats can also manage log files for mail, FTP and other servers, it is most suitable for web servers.  Configuration is done via a config file in which the location of the log file and the domain name(s) have to be specified. AWStats has no problems with multiple virtual hosts even when their traffic is logged to the same file. Typically, the statistics are updated by a cronjob, however triggering updates via the web interface can also be enabled.   | [Monthly summary](/images/articles/awstats_1.png) | | --- | | Monthly summary(click to enlarge) |   AWStats presents its data grouped by months. Visitors, number of visits, pages, hits and bandwidth are shown for the days of the month, the days of week and the hours. Average and totals are available as well. Bar charts give a direct visual impression of the data.  In the next tables, the visitors' IP addresses (optionally grouped by country using [geolocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation)), operating systems and browsers are given. The probably most important statistics, the most popular URLs and referrers is also found there, followed by the most frequent search queries and keywords. In the main window, only the first few places are shown, but the complete data is available, too. Based on the time between a visitor's first and last document access AWStats tries to calculate an average visit duration.  While the amount of different statistics is quite impressive, the filtering options are not very helpful. The only available time spans are a month or a year, so asking how many people have downloaded PDF files from a certain directory during the last week is impossible.  You can add additional statistics by defining extensions in the config file. Using regular expressions you can filter URLs, referrers, virtual hosts and other parameters. For example, this allows you to track product orders in an online shop.  AWStats received attention last year when the [Lupper worm](http://antivirus.about.com/od/virusdescriptions/a/linuxlupper.htm) used an AWStats vulnerability to infect web servers around the net. To see how the developers reacted, OS Reviews took a quick look at the code. As a result, the following new vulnerabilities have been discovered:   * If the update of the stats via web front-end is allowed, a   remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server using a   specially crafted request involving the migrate   parameter. Input starting with a pipe character ("|") leads to   an insecure call to Perl's open function and the rest of the   input being executed in a shell. The code is run in the context of   the process running the AWStats CGI. * Arbitrary code can be executed by uploading a specially   crafted configuration file if an attacker can put a file on the   server with chosen file name and content (e.g. by using an FTP   account on a shared hosting server). In this configuration file,   the LogFile directive can be used to execute shell code   following a pipe character. As above, an open call on   unsanitized input is the source of this vulnerability. * Furthermore, the cross-site scripting vulnerability described   in   [CVE-2006-1945](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2006-1945)   also exists with the diricons parameter and possibly others   as well.   Particularly notable about these holes is that they are very similar to previously discovered ones. The problems with calls to the  open function were already known before. Additionally, the developers claim that [only one vulnerability](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/awstats_security_news.php) has been found in the history of AWStats, which is simply [not true](http://secunia.com/advisories/14299/).  To be honest, not everything is bad about AWStats. However, unless its security record improves, AWStats should only be used to generate static content or on a private web server.   | | AWStats | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Version: | 6.5 | | | Homepage: | <http://awstats.sourceforge.net/> | | | License: | GPL | | | Distributions: [?] | ■ Debian stable | ■ Debian unstable | |  | ■ Fedora | ■ Mandriva | |  | □ Suse | ■ Ubuntu | | Pros: |  | | Rating: 72 | | --- | | | * Customization with Extensions | | | Cons: |  | | * Poor Security * Few Filtering Options | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Copyright 2006–2008  [OS Reviews](http://www.osreviews.net/).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-19 08:42:33 UTC  ``` AWStats contains a flaw that allows a remote cross site scripting attack. This flaw exists because input passed to "config" paremeter in "awstats.pl" isn't properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This could allow a user to create a specially crafted URL that would execute arbitrary code in a user's browser within the trust relationship between the browser and the server, leading to a loss of integrity.  Also doing XSS vuln. check attacker will get full path disclosure. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-19 08:51:53 UTC  ``` ka0ttic pls provide new ebuilds, thank you ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-20 00:30:58 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 130546](show_bug.cgi?id=130546 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - awstats-6.6 version bump") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-28 12:25:16 UTC  ``` This needs an upstream update or a patch ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carsten Lohrke (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-04 04:43:29 UTC  ``` If the update of the stats via web front-end is allowed, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server using a specially crafted request involving the migrate parameter. Input starting with a pipe character ("|") leads to an insecure call to Perl's open function and the rest of the input being executed in a shell. The code is run in the context of the process running the AWStats CGI.  Arbitrary code can be executed by uploading a specially crafted configuration file if an attacker can put a file on the server with chosen file name and content (e.g. by using an FTP account on a shared hosting server). In this configuration file, the LogFile directive can be used to execute shell code following a pipe character. As above, an open call on unsanitized input is the source of this vulnerability.  Furthermore, the cross-site scripting vulnerability described in CVE-2006-1945 also exists with the diricons parameter and possibly others as well.   <http://www.osreviews.net/reviews/comm/awstats> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-05 13:36:25 UTC  ``` Fixed in awstats 6.6 <http://awstats.sourceforge.net/awstats_security_news.php>  --> [ebuild]  and CVE-2006-1945 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 09:57:38 UTC  ``` web-apps team please bump since ka0ttic is not responding. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-18 14:37:54 UTC  ``` Hi,  sec-team : please add CVE-2006-2237 to the summary. It concerns the execution of arbitrary code in the migrate parameter pointed out in [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=130487#c4) by carlo.  web-apps : awstats-6.6 is out. Or, if you prefer, a patch is available from debian :  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/a/awstats/awstats_6.4-1sarge2.diff.gz> But i think introducing and stabilizing 6.6 is the best choice, since it corrects the other vulns (CVE-2006-1945 particularly)   web-apps, please act ? we're so late... Or, sec-team, we should try to bump an ebuild ourserlves as the policy says. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-18 16:30:09 UTC  ``` i'd even tend to mask it ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Renat Lumpau (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 05:54:04 UTC  ``` 6.6 in CVS ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 06:35:34 UTC  ``` arches pls test and stable, thank you ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Daniel Gryniewicz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 09:51:50 UTC  ``` If 6.5 has a vulnerability, and 6.6 slots, how does that fix 6.5, since it stays on your system and available?  Shouldn't 6.6 replace 6.5?  This way, if people get the upgrade without knowing about the CVE, then they might not switch to the new version...  Anyway, amd64 stable. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Thomas Cort (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 10:02:50 UTC  ``` alpha done. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 11:58:57 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-19 14:47:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=130487#c11)) > If 6.5 has a vulnerability, and 6.6 slots, how does that fix 6.5, since it > stays on your system and available?

# AWStats: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200606-06**

AWStats contains a bug in the sanitization of the input parameters which
can lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-misc/awstats** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.5-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.5-r1** |

### Background

AWStats is an advanced log file analyzer and statistics generator.

### Description

Hendrik Weimer has found that if updating the statistics via the
web frontend is enabled, it is possible to inject arbitrary code via a
pipe character in the "migrate" parameter. Additionally, r0t has
discovered that AWStats fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input
in awstats.pl.

### Impact

A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server in the
context of the application running the AWStats CGI script if updating
of the statistics via web frontend is allowed. Nonetheless, all
configurations are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
awstats.pl, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary scripts
running in the context of the victim's browser.

### Workaround

Disable statistics updates using the web frontend to avoid code
injection. However, there is no known workaround at this time
concerning the cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### Resolution

All AWStats users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-misc/awstats-6.5-r1"
```
