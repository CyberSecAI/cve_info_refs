  "response": {
    "CVE-2006-2786": {
      "root_cause": "Mozilla's lenient handling of HTTP header syntax and accepting headers with space characters between the header name and the colon. Also, handling HTTP 1.1 headers through an HTTP 1.0 proxy.",
      "weaknesses": "HTTP response smuggling due to lenient parsing of HTTP header syntax, and improper handling of HTTP 1.1 headers through an HTTP 1.0 proxy.",
      "impact": "An attacker can trick a browser into interpreting one long response as two shorter responses, leading to content injection and cross-site scripting. Attackers can steal login cookies or other sensitive data by injecting malicious code into a response from a victim site.",
      "attack_vectors": "By sending a malicious HTTP response through a proxy server that uses a HTTP/1.0 protocol or when a malicious website shares an IP with the victim website. The response includes malformed header syntax or an HTTP/1.1 header.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft HTTP responses, and either control a proxy server, or the IP of a website which shares an IP with the victim site."
