{
  "CVE-2006-2906": {
    "description": "The LZW decoding functionality in libgd 2.0.33 when processing GIF images can enter an infinite loop when decoding crafted images, leading to denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) decoding algorithm used by libgd when handling GIF image data. Specifically, a crafted GIF image can cause the LZW decoding loop to repeat indefinitely.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Infinite Loop vulnerability due to lack of proper handling of malformed GIF data during LZW decoding."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a denial of service condition. The affected process will consume 100% CPU resources, potentially making a server or application unresponsive.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves providing specially crafted GIF image data to functions that use libgd's LZW decoding capabilities, like `gdImageCreateFromGifPtr()`.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed GIF image that triggers the infinite loop during LZW decoding. No authentication is needed."
    },
    "affected_software": [
      "libgd version 2.0.33"
    ],
    "suggested_fix": "The provided patch limits the number of loops in the `LWZReadByte_()` function to avoid infinite loops. More comprehensive fixes that check for malformed LZW data would be required."
