  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2006-2555",
      "root_cause": "The `tell_player_surr_changes` function uses `sprintf` and `strcat` on fixed-size buffers without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. The `parse_command` function does not check the return value of `strchr`, causing a NULL pointer dereference if the ':' character is missing from the input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "NULL Pointer Dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "The buffer overflow in `tell_player_surr_changes` could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The NULL pointer dereference in `parse_command` can cause a server crash, leading to a denial of service.",
       "attack_vectors": "Remote. An attacker can send specially crafted packets to the server to trigger the vulnerabilities.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to connect to the server and send network packets."
