I don't see anything relevant either...

from config.php (in 1.02):

  $configArr = array();
  //--------------------------------------------------------------------
  // 'pathtodir' = the absolute path to directory containing your "rumble"
  install
  //--------------------------------------------------------------------
  $configArr['pathtodir'] = "[http://dev.monokromatik.com/rumble/";](http://dev.monokromatik.com/rumble/%22)

Nothing else is provided.

Maybe it was a custom site that was tested?

FWIW, MHG Security Team recently published an advisory on Bugtraq about
a product named "Rumble", but they failed to provide a link to the
vendor or mention anything else about it.

Well, in case anyone's interested, the product seems to be this:

  <http://dev.lophty.com/rumble/>

which is also available here:

  <http://www.getfreesofts.com/script/869/157/RUMBLE.html>

And maybe I've just been staring at things too much today, but I fail to
see how this is a flaw as it is currently written  - the script
initializes the array at the start and only sets variables, never
calling another PHP script.
