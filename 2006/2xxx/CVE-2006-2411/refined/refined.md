  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist due to insecure coding practices.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow: In `raydium_log` and `raydium_console_line_add`, the `sprintf` and `strcpy` functions are used without proper bounds checking, leading to buffer overflows.",
        "Format String Vulnerability: In `raydium_log`, the `raydium_console_line_add` function is called with a user-controlled string, causing a format string vulnerability.",
         "NULL Pointer Dereference: In `raydium_network_netcall_exec`, if the type of packet received does not correspond to a valid index in `raydium_network_netcall_type`, the function tries to call `raydium_network_netcall_func` which is initialized with a NULL pointer.",
        "Buffer Overflow and Invalid Memory Access: In `raydium_network_read`, multiple `strcpy` operations lack bounds checking, causing buffer overflows, and invalid memory access can occur when an ID greater than `RAYDIUM_NETWORK_MAX_CLIENTS` is received."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unspecified malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote exploitation is possible through the game's network protocol, affecting both clients and servers in most cases.",
           "Specific buffer overflows in `raydium_network_read` can be exploited remotely against clients only."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted network packets to either the server or client, depending on the vulnerability being targeted."
