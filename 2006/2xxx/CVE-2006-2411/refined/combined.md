How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2) Bugs
=======
--------------------------------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in raydium\_log and raydium\_console\_line\_add
--------------------------------------------------------------
The logging function of Raydium is very used in all the engine.
For example everytime a client tries to join the server it logs the
event in the console:
raydium\_log("network: client %i connected as %s"/\*,inet\_ntoa(from->sin\_addr)\*/,n,name);
This useful function is affected by a buffer-overflow bug where the
local buffer str of 255 (RAYDIUM\_MAX\_NAME\_LEN) bytes is filled using
the unsecure sprintf function.
The size of the input packet is 512 (RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_PACKET\_SIZE)
bytes of which 508 are available for the text to use for exploiting the
vulnerability.
From raydium/log.c:
// need to be secured
void raydium\_log(char \*format, ...)
{
char str[RAYDIUM\_MAX\_NAME\_LEN];
va\_list argptr;
va\_start(argptr,format);
vsprintf(str,format,argptr);
va\_end(argptr);
printf("Raydium: %sn",str);
if(raydium\_log\_file) fprintf(raydium\_log\_file,"%sn",str);
raydium\_console\_line\_add(str);
}
Similar thing for raydium\_console\_line\_add:
From raydium/console.c:
// need to secure this one too
void raydium\_console\_line\_add(char \*format, ...)
{
char str[RAYDIUM\_MAX\_NAME\_LEN];
va\_list argptr;
va\_start(argptr,format);
vsprintf(str,format,argptr);
va\_end(argptr);
raydium\_console\_line\_last++;
if(raydium\_console\_line\_last>=RAYDIUM\_CONSOLE\_MAX\_LINES)
raydium\_console\_line\_last=0;
strcpy(raydium\_console\_lines[raydium\_console\_line\_last],str);
}
-------------------------------
B] format string in raydium\_log
-------------------------------
The same raydium\_log function described above is affected also by a
format string vulnerability caused by the calling of
raydium\_console\_line\_add passing directly the text string without the
required format argument:
raydium\_console\_line\_add(str);
--------------------------------------------------------
C] NULL function pointer in raydium\_network\_netcall\_exec
--------------------------------------------------------
The function raydium\_network\_netcall\_exec is called by
raydium\_network\_read for selecting the specific function to use for
handling the type of packet received.
The raydium\_network\_netcall\_type array is initialized with the type -1
so if the attacker uses the type 0xff the function will try to call
raydium\_network\_netcall\_func which is still initialized with a NULL
pointer.
The effect is the crash of the program.
From raydium/network.c:
...
for(i=0;i<RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_MAX\_NETCALLS;i++)
{
raydium\_network\_netcall\_type[i]=-1;
raydium\_network\_netcall\_func[i]=0;
raydium\_network\_netcall\_tcp[i]=0;
}
...
void raydium\_network\_netcall\_exec(int type,char \*buff)
{
char tmpbuff[RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_PACKET\_SIZE];
int i;
void (\*f)(int, char\*);
for(i=0;i<RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_MAX\_NETCALLS;i++)
if(raydium\_network\_netcall\_type[i]==type)
{
memcpy(tmpbuff,buff,RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_PACKET\_SIZE);
f=raydium\_network\_netcall\_func[i];
f(type,tmpbuff);
}
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------
D] buffer-overflow and invalid memory access in raydium\_network\_read
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The function raydium\_network\_read is affectd by some buffer-overflow
bugs which happen during the writing of some global variables
allocated in an array of 32 (RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_MAX\_SERVERS) elements.
The same function is also affected by an invalid memory access could
happen when the server sends a packet to the client containing an 8
bit id bigger than 8 (RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_MAX\_CLIENTS).
Both the bugs can be exploited only versus the clients.
From raydium/network.c:
signed char raydium\_network\_read(int \*id, signed char \*type, char \*buff)
...
strcpy(raydium\_network\_server\_list[slot].name,name);
...
strcpy(raydium\_network\_server\_list[slot].info,info);
...
i=buff[RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_PACKET\_OFFSET];
strcpy(raydium\_network\_name[i],buff+RAYDIUM\_NETWORK\_PACKET\_OFFSET+1);
...
