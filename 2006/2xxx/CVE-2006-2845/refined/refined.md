```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the usage of an unsanitized `REX[INCLUDE_PATH]` parameter in several Redaxo CMS files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

Attack vectors:
By crafting a malicious URL with the `REX[INCLUDE_PATH]` parameter pointing to a remote file containing malicious code.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Redaxo CMS instance and have a remote server with the malicious file.
