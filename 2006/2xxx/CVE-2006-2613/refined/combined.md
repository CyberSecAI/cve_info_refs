How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; cs-CZ; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; cs-CZ; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040910
I am not sure if this should be considered as security bug. If you don't think
so, open it.
Page which call window.sidebar.addSearchEngine() with bad agruments (bad suffix,
protocol) can catch the exception of the Mozilla code and from it obtain path to
the Mozilla installlation.
Problem is in the nsSidebar.js (in Mozilla and Firefox too) containing line:
this.promptService.alert(null, "Failed to add the search engine.");
there is missing the 3th alert argument (text of the dialog), which raises
expception e.g.:
[Exception... "Not enough arguments [nsIPromptService.alert]" nsresult:
"0x80570001 (NS\_ERROR\_XPC\_NOT\_ENOUGH\_ARGS)" location: "JS frame ::
file:///C:/Program%20Files/mozilla.org/Mozilla/components/nsSidebar.js ::
anonymous :: line 266" data: no]
HTML page can catch this exception and obtain the path of the problematic file
(i.e. the path of Mozilla installation).
Revealing the path to the nsSidebar.js is not probably critical problem, but
what if the exception raises in some extension in the user profile and the page
can catch path to the user profile (and the user login)?
So problem is propably more general. Should be the HTML page able to catch
exceptions from the Mozilla code? And if should, should it obtain a full text of
the expections (including file path)?
Reproducible: Always

nsSidebar.js doesn't live in chrome, it's a component.

I'm not too worried about revealing the installation directory (it's generally
in an easily guessed default location), but Met is absolutely right that this
could potentially reveal the profile location. Would require:
- user installs Firefox extension (profile-based)
- extension uses a javascript component (chrome js exceptions would just reveal
that the extension exists)
- extension exposes their component to web content somehow -- probably rare
Then the attacker would also have to know of a local-file-stealing exploit for
the profile location to be useful. In limited situations just knowing the
OS-login name might be useful to an attacker and that would usually be revealed
(unless the user chose a non-default profile location, and that's not generally
possible in Firefox without secret command-line args).
One "fix" for this bug would be to prevent the sidebar component from throwing
exceptions into user scripts. That seems like the friendly thing to do in any
case for sidebar, but that doesn't fix the potential for this to occur in some
popular but badly coded extension. Rather we need to fix this at the JS
exception level somehow.
Blue skying: if the exception is going to put a file: url in there just list the
filename, but strip the rest of the path. That's a little severe and hurts
people trying to develop apps on their local disk. Could perhaps check whether
the top level script is priveged or not, or what scheme it came from. Or just
strip paths by default and let developers flip a pref to get full paths like the
plugin.expose\_full\_path pref.
Nominating for 1.0 just to get consideration, but without knowing of a specific
profile-installed extension that can be induced to throw an exception into web
content I don't think we need to take this kind of change so late. Good 1.1/1.8

Could we have our exception objects implement nsISecurityCheckedComponent and do a CanAccess check from the caller principal to the filename URI?
For DOMException this could be tough because it has classinfo claiming it's a DOM object and therefore would short-circuit the nsISecurityCheckedComponent check, but maybe we can change said classinfo?

That's a perfectly fine fix that we want, but we should not claim it fixes this bug (I don't think it even fixes neil's [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=267645#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Page can obtain path to Mozilla installation or possibly profile by examining JavaScript exceptions") testcase).

You're right, I should have said "for one known case of this" instead of "for the one known case of this". It does not fix the case from [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=267645#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Page can obtain path to Mozilla installation or possibly profile by examining JavaScript exceptions"). I'll post a patch that does, because it's a trivial fix, but getting a better general solution to this bug would obviously be better than trying to play whack-a-mole with all the places this can happen.

Yes, see [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=267645#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - Page can obtain path to Mozilla installation or possibly profile by examining JavaScript exceptions"). There may be other unknown errors that will expose similar problems, so we need a general solution, rather than relying on being able to identify all the potential problem areas.

I wanted to give a quick update on the current state of this, which has changed a lot since [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=267645#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - Page can obtain path to Mozilla installation or possibly profile by examining JavaScript exceptions").
Once [bug 888600](/show_bug.cgi?id=888600 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move ContentFrameMessageManager to WebIDL") lands (matter of days, I hope), all web-exposed things will be either WebIDL or some sort of direct injection via exportFunction.
When calling through WebIDL, if a JS exception is thrown as part of the \_implementation\_, one of the following things happens:
\* If this is JS-implemented WebIDL, then CallbackObject::CallSetup::ShouldRethrowException does a security check and will not expose exceptions thrown by chrome to webpages. They will be reported to the console and a sanitized exception thrown to the webpage. We have tests for this behavior.
\* If this is C++-implemented WebIDL that calls a JS XPCOM component that throws, we will end up in dom::ThrowExceptionValueIfSafe and again do a security check to make sure it's OK to expose the exception. See [bug 1295322](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295322 "RESOLVED FIXED - In the newest nightly builds, its possible to capture chrome level exceptions at content level.") for where we changed that.
So I believe we have now put in place the general solution this bug was about, for WebIDL.
For the direct-injection case... I'm not sure what the situation is.

We talked to :baku about this and he thinks we need to sanitize the direct injection case. We can look for an Exception in the JSContext, take it out, sanitize it if it's there, and then put it back. We can reuse the same type of sanitization we already have. But first we need to write a test to show it failing.

OK, I tried editing the testcase to from [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=267645#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - Page can obtain path to Mozilla installation or possibly profile by examining JavaScript exceptions") make sense: to make the sandbox less privileged than the exported function, and to examine the state the *sandbox* sees, not the state the privileged caller sees.

As things stand, the sandbox ends up with a direct reference (via CCWs, of course) to the privileged exception, and attempting to get properties off it results in security errors.

Is that good enough, or do we still want to do some sort of sanitizing behavior to prevent those security errors?

It looks good to me.

Tom, can you take a look?

Truthfully I don't have a solid grasp of everything here, but it seems like it would be okay to me. Could one probe to see if a property exists (returns a security error) vs doesn't and infer something about the user's machine from it? That seems unlikely - they would probably just be able to infer something about the exception thrown which isn't concerning, because they caused it to be thrown.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
