## Microsoft Word object pointer memory corruption vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#446012

Original Release Date: 2006-05-19 | Last Revised: 2006-06-14

---

### Overview

A memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Word could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word.

### Description

| Microsoft Word contains a memory corruption vulnerability. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-027](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-027.mspx):  *When a user opens a specially crafted Word document using a malformed object pointer, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.* Office documents can contain embedded objects. For example, a malicious Word document could be embedded in an Excel or PowerPoint document. Office documents other than Word documents could be used as attack vectors. For more information, including a complete list of affected software refer to Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-027](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-027.mspx)Note that working exploit code is available for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Word document, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Word. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from Microsoft**Microsoft addresses this vulnerability with the updates listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-027](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-027.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Do not open untrusted Word documents**  Do not open unfamiliar or unexpected Word or other Office documents, particularly those hosted on web sites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-010.html) for more information.**Consult Microsoft Security Bulletin** [**MS06-027**](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-027.mspx) **and** **Microsoft Security Advisory (**[**919637**](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/919637.mspx)**)**Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-027](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-027.mspx) and Microsoft Security Advisory ([919637](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/919637.mspx)) list workarounds to reduce the chances of exploitation, including     + Run Word in [Safe Mode](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP030823931033.aspx) (winword.exe /safe) + Do not use Word as the email editor in Outlook  **Do not rely on file name extension filtering**In most cases, Windows will call Word to open a document even if the document has an unknown file extension. For example, if document.qwer contains the correct file header information, Windows will open document.qwer with Word. Filtering for common extensions (e.g., .doc, .dot, .rtf) may not detect all Word documents. |

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Word Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2492

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Word using a malformed object pointer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Word Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2492:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability can not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* On Office XP and Office 2003, this vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**Note** While this vulnerability could not be exploited automatically when visiting a Web site using Word 2000, Office 2000 does not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Word Code Remote Code Execution Using a Malformed Object Pointer Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2492:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Always use Microsoft Word in Safe Mode**

  Using Word in Safe Mode helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  **Step 1 - Disable Outlook Feature to Use Word as the E-mail Editor**

  **For Enterprise Customers**

  **Manual (User Interaction)**
  Enterprise Users follow these steps to disable the Outlook feature to use Word as mail editor:

  1. Restart the machine.
  2. Open Outlook
  3. Click **Tools**, click **Options,** and then click the **Mail Format** tab.
  4. Clear the Use Microsoft Word to edit e-mail messages check box\*\*.\*\*
  5. Clear the Use Microsoft Word to read Rich Text e-mail messages box.
  6. Exit Outlook.

  For more information on turning Word on or off as your e-mail editor see [Turning Word on or off as your e-mail editor.](https://office.microsoft.com/assistance/hp052428491033.aspx)

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users will not be able to use Word as their e-mail editor or use Rich Text to read their e-mail

  **Using Group Policy**

  Domain administrators can use Group Policy to disable Word as the users e-mail editor. You do not have to restart the computer to implement this mitigation.

  For information on using registry keys with a Group Policy see [Using Administrative Template Files with Registry-Based Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/gp/admtgp.mspx) and [Distributing Registry Changes](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms954395).

  **Disable WordMail in Word 2003**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Options\Mail]

  "EditorPreference"=dword:00020000

  "UseWordMail"=dword:00000000

  **Disable WordMail in Word 2002**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\10.0\Outlook\Options\Mail]

  "EditorPreference"=dword:00020000

  "UseWordMail"=dword:00000000

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users will not be able to use Word as their e-mail editor or use Rich Text by default to read their e-mail.

  **Step 2 Append /safe to the WINWORD.EXE Command Line**

  **For Enterprise Customers**

  Using Word in Safe Mode helps protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

  All versions of Word have an application recovery feature that allows running Word in Safe mode. Safe mode disables the functionality and prevents vulnerable code from being exploited. The full set of limitations can be found at: [https://office.microsoft.com/assistance/HP030823931033.aspx](https://office.microsoft.com/assistance/hp030823931033.aspx).

  1. Word will display **SAFE MODE** in the title bar if it is operating in Safe Mode.
  2. Right-click your desktop.
  3. Select **New/Shortcut.**
  4. Select **Browse**.
  5. Locate winword.exe\*\*.\*\*
  6. Append â /safeâ (without quotes) to the end of the file location, after the quotation mark.
  7. Click **Next**, and name your shortcut as âWord Safe Modeâ.
  8. Click **Finish**.

  To open a Word document, follow the steps listed below:

  1. Save your Word document to a disk or to your desktop.
  2. Start Word using your âWord Safe Modeâ shortcut.
  3. Click **File**, click **Open**, and then browse to the document you want to open.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Users that work in Safe mode will be subject to the limitations outlined in [About Office Safe Mode](https://office.microsoft.com/assistance/hp030823931033.aspx).

  **Enterprise Customers Using Group Policy**

  Domain administrators can use Group Policy to enable Safe Mode for. You do not have to restart the computer to implement this mitigation.

  **Note** Even after applying the workarounds that implements a registry change, do not open Word files directly from e-mail clients other than Outlook, for example MSN Hotmail, by double-clicking them

  For information on using registry keys with a Group Policy see [Using Administrative Template Files with Registry-Based Group Policy](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/gp/admtgp.mspx) and [Distributing Registry Changes](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms954395).

  **Note** Exact locations of registry keys depend on installation paths for Office used in each corporation. Registry keys will have to be determined by IT administrators to match their unique installation paths. The locations listed in the examples above correspond to the default installation paths for Microsoft Office. For example the default path for Office 10 on English Windows would be "c:\program files\microsoft office\office10".

  **Note** To ensure Word is being loaded in Safe Mode when opening, editing or printing documents, the âDefaultâ and âCommandâ registry values in the following registry keys should be edited to include the â/safeâ command line parameter (without the quotes).

  For example, if Office 2003 is installed the âDefaultâ value should be changed to look like this: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11\WINWORD.EXE" /n /dde /safe, and the âCommandâ value should be changed to look like this: â']gAVn-}f(ZXfeAR6.jiWORDFiles>P`os,1@SW=P7v6GPl]Xh /n /dde /safeâ.

  **Note** The âCommandâ value is an encoded string that is version-specific and language-specific, and it may not appear exactly as shown above on all systems.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions such as repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:

**Msiexec /I** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/qb REINSTALL=\*\*Feature List **REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2003), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Word 2003 | WORDFiles |
| Word 2003 Viewer | WORDVIEWFiles |

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization on the [Office Admin Update Center](https://office.microsoft.com/fx011511561033.aspx). On the home page of that site, look under the **Update Strategies** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by the Windows Installer.

**Administrative Installation File Information**

The English version of this update has the file attributes that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Word 2003:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Winword.exe | 11.0.8026.0 | 15-May-2006 | 21:39 | 12,148,496 |

Word 2003 Viewer:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wordview.exe | 11.0.8026.0 | 15-May-2006 | 21:39 | 6,958,864 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

* **File Version Verification**

**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

   **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

   **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
