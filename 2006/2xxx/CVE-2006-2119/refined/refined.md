{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` script of the Artmedic Event application. Specifically, the script includes user-supplied input through the `$page` parameter without proper sanitization, which allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request with a crafted `page` parameter.",
      "Example: http://www.site.com/[path]/event/index.php?page=evilcode.txt?&cmd=uname -a"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
