libtiff security update (RHSA-2006-0425)

Original Release Date: June 13, 2006

Last Revised: February 21, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-119

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Libtiff is a library containing functions for operating on TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) image files.

Libtiff was found to contain an integer overflow flaw. Using a specially
crafted TIFF file, an attacker could possibly cause an application linked to
libtiff to either crash or execute arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
[CVE-2006-2025](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2025) to this issue.

Libtiff was found to contain a double free vulnerability. Via a specially
crafted TIFF file, an attacker could possibly cause an application linked
to libtiff to crash or execute arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
[CVE-2006-2026](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2026) to this issue.

Libtiff was found to contain several denial of service vulnerabilities.
Using a specially crafted TIFF file, an attacker could possibly cause an
application linked to libtiff to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the names
[CVE-2006-2024](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2024) and
[CVE-2006-2120](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2120) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0425.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with libtiff installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | IALX 1.x | Low | Update to IALX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 1.x - 2.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 1.x - 3.0 | Low | Update to MN 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of libtiff, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through
the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update
becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200605-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities, ranging from integer overflows and NULL
pointer dereferences to double frees, were reported in libTIFF.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user
to open a specially crafted TIFF image, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.1"
```

My tiff-3.7.3 (last stable, x86) is affected.  kuickshow, and xzgv totally crash.  gv, Gimp and konqueror can't display the picture but they recover the error and they don't crash. My Firefox doesn't display the picture at all.  However, it may be possible to send a special .tiff file via a mail or a web server and to cause the client's application to crash. Since i wasn't able to find an example of mail-application or web-application crashing, please check if this is possible.  Thanks to ed who has indicated us the bug. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-13 06:30:05 UTC  ``` This seems related with #1029 : <http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1029> which has a CVE entry : <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0405> Or, at least, it has the same effects (application crash)  Corrected in upstream CVS. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-22 03:27:28 UTC  ``` graphics / taviso: care to patch ? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-25 22:36:07 UTC  ``` Upstream [bug 1102](show_bug.cgi?id=1102 "RESOLVED FIXED - app-text/pinfo: update from pinfo 0.6.3 to pinfo 0.6.5 w/ an NLS bug fix") is CVE-2006-202{4-6}.

Me? :)  The only thing I committed to tiff was a digest fix for [bug 131396](show_bug.cgi?id=131396 "RESOLVED FIXED - Packages with bad SHA256 hash").

See SA-19838 <http://secunia.com/advisories/19838/> It's note a B3 anymore, it's an A2.  it seems hard to "grep" the different patches from the CVS tree. 3.8.1 is out since a while and corrects the vuln. 3.8.2 is in portage and ~arched.  Graphics team, do you want to mark stable 3.8.2 or (introduce in portage and) mark stable 3.8.1 ?   ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 10:12:34 UTC  ``` Hi all, i've merged the diff from debian [1] correcting CVE-2006-202[456], and the one from Red Hat [2] correcting CVE-2006-2120. Debian hasn't corrected CVE-2006-2120 issue, don't ask me why.  Please verify this patch and add it to portage, then mark stable either 3.8.1, or 3.7.3/3.7.4 patched.  adm64, ppc, sparc, x86 : 3.7.4 alpha, hppa, ppc64, sh : 3.7.3 ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 10:13:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 86490](attachment.cgi?id=86490 "patch 3.7.4") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=86490&action=edit "patch 3.7.4"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=86490&action=diff "patch 3.7.4")] patch 3.7.4 ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 10:15:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 86492](attachment.cgi?id=86492 "patch 3.7.3 (not verified)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=86492&action=edit "patch 3.7.3 (not verified)"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=86492&action=diff "patch 3.7.3 (not verified)")] patch 3.7.3 (not verified) ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-09 10:21:41 UTC  ``` references of #7 [1] <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/t/tiff/tiff_3.7.2-3sarge1.diff.gz> [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=128248&action=edit> ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-27 01:08:36 UTC  ``` arches, please test and mark 3.8.2 stable, thank you ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Fabian Groffen   gentoo-dev  2006-05-27 01:59:57 UTC  ``` ppc-macos stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Jose Luis Rivero (yoswink) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-27 05:16:17 UTC  ``` stable on alpha.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-27 05:22:18 UTC  ``` I unkeyworded media-libs/tiff-3.8.2 , and emerged it with collision-protect. Builds fine on x86.

The dates are as such:  2006-03-07  Andrey Kiselev  <dron.edu> 2006-03-03  Andrey Kiselev  <dron.edu>   Denial of service -----------------     * libtiff/tif_dirread.c: Fixed error reporting in TIFFFetchAnyArray()     function      * libtiff/{tif_lzw.c, tif_pixarlog.c, tif_zip.c}: Use     TIFFPredictorCleanup() in codec cleanup methods.      * libtiff/{tif_jpeg.c, tif_pixarlog.c, tif_fax3.c, tif_zip.c}:     Properly restore setfield/getfield methods in cleanup functions.      * libtiff/{tif_predict.c, tif_predict.h}: Added new function     TIFFPredictorCleanup() to restore parent decode/encode/field methods.  Integer Overflow ----------------     * libtiff/tif_dirread.c: Fixed integer overflow condition in     TIFFFetchData() function.      * libtiff/tif_dirread.c: More wise check for integer overflow     condition  Double Free -----------     * libtiff/{tif_jpeg.c, tif_pixarlog.c, tif_fax3.c, tif_zip.c}:     Properly restore setfield/getfield methods in cleanup functions.      Only the tif_jpeg.c patch has been shown to cause a double free issue.     This block is the same as the one in the DoS section, just copied here for     the double free description.   These issues seem to affect RHEL2.1 and RHEL3  The quick testing I did consisted of running tiffinfo over the reproducers in the upstream bug, only the attachment in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=189933#c1) crashed on RHEL.  A source analysis may be needed to verify all these issues.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=189933#c3)  Matthias Clasen    2006-04-26 14:44:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128255](attachment.cgi?id=128255&action=diff "patch that applies to RHEL21 and RHEL3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128255&action=edit "patch that applies to RHEL21 and RHEL3") patch that applies to RHEL21 and RHEL3   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=189933#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-05-09 11:32:43 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CAN-2006-2024 CAN-2006-2025 CAN-2006-2026
BugTraq IDs    : 17730 17732 17733

Tavis Ormandy discovered several vulnerabilities in the TIFF library
that can lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-2024

    Multiple vulnerabilities allow attackers to cause a denial of
    service.

CVE-2006-2025

    An integer overflows allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-2026

    A double-free vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.5-7woody1.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.2-3sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.
