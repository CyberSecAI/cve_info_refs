```
Root cause of vulnerability: A double free vulnerability exists in the libtiff library.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Double free.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious TIFF file that, when processed by an application using libtiff, could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.
Attack vectors: Specially crafted TIFF file.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to open the crafted TIFF file with an application that uses the vulnerable libtiff library. This could involve sending the file via email or hosting it on a web server.
