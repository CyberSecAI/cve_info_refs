The input packet size is 512 bytes, with 508 bytes available for the text, which can easily overflow the buffer. The `raydium_console_line_add` function also uses `vsprintf` into a 255-byte buffer, then copies the result into another buffer using `strcpy`, which is also vulnerable to overflows if the source is larger than the destination."

Specifically, `strcpy(raydium_network_server_list[slot].name,name)` and  `strcpy(raydium_network_server_list[slot].info,info)` can overflow the server list structures, and `strcpy(raydium_network_name[i],buff+RAYDIUM_NETWORK_PACKET_OFFSET+1)` can overflow the client name buffer because `i` is not validated."
