Welcome to Geeklog, Anonymous Saturday, January 25 2025 @ 02:38 am EST

## About Geeklog

Geeklog is an open source application for managing dynamic web content. It is written in PHP and supports MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database backend.

"Out of the box", Geeklog is a [CMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system "Click to look up 'CMS' on Wikipedia"), or a [blog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Click to look up 'blog' on Wikipedia") engine with support for comments, [trackbacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback "Click to look up 'Trackback' on Wikipedia"), multiple [syndication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication "Click to look up 'Web Syndication' on Wikipedia") formats, spam protection, and all the other vital features of such a system.

The core Geeklog distribution can easily be extended by the many community developed plugins and other add-ons to radically alter its functionality. Available plugins include forums, image galleries, and many more.

## [Glossary Plugin](https://www.geeklog.net/article.php/2021111317372859)

[![Plugins](https://www.geeklog.net/images/topics/plugins.png "Plugins")](https://www.geeklog.net/index.php/topic/plugins)

The oldish Glossary Plugin is re-released. The code is re-developed, but the database stays the same for now. See [latest developments](http://php7.pbsolo.nl) or demo yourselves [with a large grossary](http://www.mycobol.net).

The plugin is intended to create glossaries for your site, whilst your content can be enriched with links to known glossary entries. Multiple subjects are supported and a autotag lets you choose which subject to use for a certain text.

Make sure you have users added to the glossary.admin and/or glossary.edit security groups.

Glossary catches the userID that submits a term, and the userID that edits a term. Along with a timeStamp. Categories can be defined which work site wide.

Configuration is still old-fashioned; find them in config.php. Available languages are English and German (with thanks to Alexander Schmacks).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
