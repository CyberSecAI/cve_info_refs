Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-2223 CVE-2006-2224 CVE-2006-2276
BugTraq ID     : 17808
Debian Bugs    : 365940 366980

Konstantin Gavrilenko discovered several vulnerabilities in quagga,
the BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-2223

    Remote attackers may obtain sensitive information via RIPv1
    REQUEST packets even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5
    authentication.

CVE-2006-2224

    Remote attackers could inject arbitrary routes using the RIPv1
    RESPONSE packet even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5
    authentication.

CVE-2006-2276

    Fredrik Widell discovered that local users are can cause a denial
    of service ia a certain sh ip bgp command entered in the telnet
    interface.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain quagga packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.98.3-7.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Quagga Routing Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200605-15**

Quagga's RIP daemon allows the injection of routes and the disclosure of
routing information. The BGP daemon is vulnerable to a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/quagga** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.98.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.98.6-r1** |

### Background

The Quagga Routing Suite implements three major routing protocols:
RIP (v1/v2/v3), OSPF (v2/v3) and BGP4.

### Description

Konstantin V. Gavrilenko discovered two flaws in the Routing
Information Protocol (RIP) daemon that allow the processing of RIP v1
packets (carrying no authentication) even when the daemon is configured
to use MD5 authentication or, in another case, even if RIP v1 is
completely disabled. Additionally, Fredrik Widell reported that the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) daemon contains a flaw that makes it lock
up and use all available CPU when a specific command is issued from the
telnet interface.

### Impact

By sending RIP v1 response packets, an unauthenticated attacker
can alter the routing table of a router running Quagga's RIP daemon and
disclose routing information. Additionally, it is possible to lock up
the BGP daemon from the telnet interface.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Quagga users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/quagga-0.98.6-r1"
```
