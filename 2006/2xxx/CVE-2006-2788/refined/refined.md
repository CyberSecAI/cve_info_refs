  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a double memory free in the `nsIX509::getRawDER` function, which could be triggered when called from JavaScript. This could lead to a denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a double free in the `nsIX509::getRawDER` method when called from JavaScript. The method does not copy the data returned, leading to a double free when the JavaScript garbage collector tries to free it again.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Double memory free"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious web page or email message that triggers the double free via JavaScript.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Malicious web page",
         "Malicious email message"
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to lure the victim into opening the malicious web page or email message and have javascript enabled.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `getRawDER` method is called from Javascript. In the fix, the method was changed to copy the output data, so that the javascript garbage collector can operate safely."
