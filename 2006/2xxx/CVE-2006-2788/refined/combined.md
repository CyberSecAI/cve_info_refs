| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=200161#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-07-25 20:24:57 UTC  ``` Several Issues were discovered in Seamonkey, they are expected to be fixed in the next upstream Seamonkey release   [CVE-2006-3807](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3807) MFSA 2006-51 [CVE-2006-3809](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3809) MFSA 2006-53 [CVE-2006-3812](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3812) MFSA 2006-56 Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processes certain javascript actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install browser malware.   [CVE-2006-3801](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3801) MFSA 2006-44 [CVE-2006-3677](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3677) MFSA 2006-45 [CVE-2006-3113](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3113) MFSA 2006-46 [CVE-2006-3803](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3803) MFSA 2006-48 [CVE-2006-3805](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3805) MFSA 2006-50 [CVE-2006-3806](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3806) MFSA 2006-50 [CVE-2006-3811](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3811) MFSA 2006-55 Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processes certain javascript actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary code as the user running the browser.   [CVE-2006-3802](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3802) MFSA 2006-47 [CVE-2006-3810](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3810) MFSA 2006-54 Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processes certain javascript actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross site scripting attack or steal sensitive information such as cookies owned by other domains.   [CVE-2006-3808](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3808) MFSA 2006-52 A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processes Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install browser malware.   [CVE-2006-3804](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3804) MFSA 2006-49 A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Seamonkey displayed malformed inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing a carefully crafted vcard it is possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey-mail.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=200161#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-07-25 20:44:03 UTC  ``` These issues also affect the RHEL3 Seamonkey.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=200161#c5)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-02 18:31:26 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

BugTraq ID     : 20042

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-2788

    Fernando Ribeiro discovered that a vulnerability in the getRawDER
    functionallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4340

    Daniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error
    in RSA signature verification that cause the application to
    incorrectly trust SSL certificates.

CVE-2006-4565, CVE-2006-4566

    Priit Laes reported that that a JavaScript regular expression can
    trigger a heap-based buffer overflow which allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2006-4568

    A vulnerability has been discovered that allows remote attackers
    to bypass the security model and inject content into the sub-frame
    of another site.

CVE-2006-4570

    Georgi Guninski demonstrated that even with JavaScript disabled in
    mail (the default) an attacker can still execute JavaScript when a
    mail message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded.

CVE-2006-4571

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Firefox, Thunderbird and
    SeaMonkey allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service,
    corrupt memory, and possibly execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge7.3.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla
package are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Seamonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This
update deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in
favor of the supported Seamonkey Suite.

This update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,
CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,
CVE-2006-3812)

Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey.
(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,
CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

Two flaws were found in the way Seamonkey-mail displayed malformed
inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing
a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the
user running Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed
Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web
page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer
could miss due to a malformed "script" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack
or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).
(CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

A form file upload flaw was found in the way Seamonkey handled javascript
input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local
file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Seamonkey called the
crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the
browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return
specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy
restrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)

A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A
malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was
called. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible
to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Seamonkey version 1.0.3 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Multilib systems may experience difficulty if trying to specify the package
by name to the Update Agent via a command line argument. This can be
solved by executing the following commands:

up2date seamonkey; up2date seamonkey-nss seamonkey-nspr

While i call the getRawDER function of nsIX509Cert (security/manager/ssl/public) it freeze in all mozilla browser and firefox (except 1.5 [windows/linux] and mozilla 1.8b1 [linux] no extension installed success, opening other bug request for these);
I'm call the function in a javascript and native mode, but both freeze the browser.
----------------
JavaScript
----------------
try{
netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege( "UniversalXPConnect");
...
if(cert instanceof Components.interfaces.nsIX509Cert){
var length = {value:0};
var data=[];
data = cert.getRawDER(length);// <-- travamento
}
}catch(err){
alert("Erro: " + err);
}

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open <http://www.nerdgroup.org/staff/fernando/html/ns/index-env.html>
2. Install the extension in botton page with root user
3. Write any text message in the 'text' area.
4. Click in 'Enviar' button.
Actual Results:
It freeze the browser.
Expected Results:
show encrypted message in other text area.

The call getRawDER() of a nsIX509Cert(security/manager/ssl/public) instance freeze Linux machines, on Windows everything works.
See javascript line:
data = cert.getRawDER(length);// <-- freeze
to workaround this problem I have written a code in C++:
rv = cert->GetRawDER(&length, &data);// <-- freeze
but the error persist. :(
Looking in the C++ implementation of nsIX509Cert
file nsNSSCertificate.cpp (src/security/manager/ssl/src):
NS\_IMETHODIMP
nsNSSCertificate::GetRawDER(PRUint32 \*aLength, PRUint8 \*\*aArray)
{
nsNSSShutDownPreventionLock locker; <-- freeze probably here
if (isAlreadyShutDown()) <-- it cannot be here
return NS\_ERROR\_NOT\_AVAILABLE;
if (mCert) {
\*aArray = (PRUint8 \*)mCert->derCert.data;
\*aLength = mCert->derCert.len;
return NS\_OK;
}
\*aLength = 0;
return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
}
file nsNSSShutDown.h (src/security/manager/ssl/src)
PRBool isAlreadyShutDown() { return mAlreadyShutDown; }
file nsNSSShutDown.cpp (src/security/manager/ssl/src)
nsNSSShutDownPreventionLock::nsNSSShutDownPreventionLock()
{
nsNSSActivityState \*state = nsNSSShutDownList::getActivityState(); <-- it cannot be here
if (!state)
return;
state->enter(); <-- probably here
}
file nsNSSShutDown.h (src/security/manager/ssl/src)
static nsNSSActivityState \*getActivityState()
{
return singleton ? &singleton->mActivityState : nsnull;
}
file nsNSSShutDown.cpp (src/security/manager/ssl/src)
void nsNSSActivityState::enter()
{
PR\_Lock(mNSSActivityStateLock); <-- probably here, other security component have been not release the lock
while (mNSSRestrictedThread && mNSSRestrictedThread != PR\_GetCurrentThread()) {
PR\_WaitCondVar(mNSSActivityChanged, PR\_INTERVAL\_NO\_TIMEOUT); <-- can be here too
}
++mNSSActivityCounter;
PR\_Unlock(mNSSActivityStateLock);
}
In my opinion some another component got the lock for the Certificate but it didn't release it in the Linux implementation... =/ some idea?

Fernando, I've never seen a deadlock in this area.
You say you are able to reproduce it using JavaScript.
Are you able to produce a simple test case, a web page that uses JavaScript to call getRawDER, and make your test case available on a web site, so I can see the problem myself?
Thanks

Fernando, I don't want to install your binary component. I hope you don't mind that I say, the bug could be in your own code, and I don't have the time to debug it.
Please demonstrate that you can reproduce the bug without your extension, but with a simple HTML/JS page that calls getRawDER, and I'll be glad to have a look.

I'm not sure that testing this from JS is useful. As that function doesn't copy its out arguments, calls from JS will corrupt the heap due to a double-free.

This javascript example with getrawDER freeze the browser.
It run only on local. In remote site (<http://www.nerdgroup.org/staff/fernando/test/>) it return "was denied UniversalXPConnect privileges".
Then, if you can to save the index.html in your machine and open it, your browser freeze and can you to debug.
Thank you a million.

You need to have a pkcs11 certificate installed.

Patch v1
r=rrelyea
With the following caveat... you get approval for a change to a frozen API.
The API does not declare the array as const, so one can argue that this was just a bug, but C++ code may actually leak now.
Be sure to let the Camino folks know about this change, I believe they may use GetRawDER to get access to the real certificates.

Does that mean, somebody could be using the reference to the raw DER cert as a way to modify it directly, thus bypassing any other NSS APIs?

The Cert Viewer Plus extension for Firefox and Thunderbird I just released would also benefit from this fix, actually (I'm calling getRawDER() from JS):
<https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=1964>
Currently, I'm advising Linux users to relax glibc's malloc checking by setting MALLOC\_CHECK\_ to 0 before starting the application (but would be glad if I could remove this warning as soon as possible, of course).
BTW, libc implementations on other OSes (FreeBSD, Mac OS X) will also lead to warnings ("modified (page-) pointer", "Deallocation of a pointer not malloced"), but on these platforms the application will not freeze - this seems to be limited to glibc in its default configuration.

That seems like an insane idea to me, to be honest...

(In reply to [comment #21](/show_bug.cgi?id=321598#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - Double memory free in nsIX509::getRawDER when called from JavaScript"))
From what I understand when reading malloc(3), setting MALLOC\_CHECK\_ to 0 doesn't disable malloc checking completely - it switches to a somewhat more tolerant implementation (0 means "no diagnostic output", it's also possible to run Firefox with MALLOC\_CHECK\_=1):
When MALLOC\_CHECK\_ is set, a special (less efficient) implementation
is used which is designed to be tolerant against simple errors,
such as double calls of free() with the same argument, or overruns of a
single byte (off-by-one bugs). Not all such errors can be protected
against, however, and memory leaks can result. If MALLOC\_CHECK\_ is set
to 0, any detected heap corruption is silently ignored; if set to 1, a
diagnostic is printed on stderr; if set to 2, abort() is called immedi-
ately.
I agree that setting MALLOC\_CHECK\_ is an unpleasant workaround and am hoping that this bug is fixed as soon as possible.

Bob, we discussed this change on the Drivers mailing list. Nobody objected to this change. I think I fixed all callers, I did not see any calls in Camino code.
Fernando, to answer your question, the fix will be contained in Firefox 2 and 3.
I don't know yet if we will be allowed to fix 1.5.x

Fernando, could you retest this with the latest release candidate? Or maybe you can point me to some dummy certificates I can use to recreate the problem before I test it myself on the fixed version.

This now looks like it leaks from the getRawDER callers in nsNSSCertificateDB (part of the 220816 patch was dealing with these leaks, although there appears to be another caller now. at least on trunk).Summary: Double memory free in nsIX509::getRawDER → Double memory free in nsIX509::getRawDER when called from JavaScriptWhiteboard: [sg:moderate]

# USN-361-1: Mozilla vulnerabilities

10 October 2006

Mozilla vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute

arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening

a malicious URL. ([CVE-2006-2788](/security/CVE-2006-2788), [CVE-2006-3805](/security/CVE-2006-3805), [CVE-2006-3806](/security/CVE-2006-3806),

[CVE-2006-3807](/security/CVE-2006-3807), [CVE-2006-3809](/security/CVE-2006-3809), [CVE-2006-3811](/security/CVE-2006-3811), [CVE-2006-4565](/security/CVE-2006-4565),

[CVE-2006-4568](/security/CVE-2006-4568), [CVE-2006-4571](/security/CVE-2006-4571))

A bug was found in the script handler for automatic proxy

configuration. A malicious proxy could send scripts which could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2006-3808](/security/CVE-2006-3808))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5

signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely

used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures

without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](/security/CVE-2006-4340))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a

malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is

viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL

file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](/security/CVE-2006-4570))
