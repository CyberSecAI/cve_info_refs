{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within BBCode-like tags ([color], [size], [url]) allows for injection of arbitrary HTML attributes and Javascript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of a user's browser when they view a forum post containing the malicious code. This could result in:\n-Stealing user session cookies.\n-Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n-Performing actions on behalf of the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted forum posts"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify forum posts and include specially crafted BBCode-like tags. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.",
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability exists in the processing of [color], [size], and [url] tags. By injecting a quote character within the tag's value, the attacker can break out of the intended attribute and add their own HTML attributes, such as 'onMouseOver', which can execute Javascript code. The parser doesn't sanitize user-supplied values within the color, size, and url attributes, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML attributes. The parser also does not close the injected attribute, allowing the attacker to do that themselves. The vulnerability occurs due to the parser closing the attributes with \" after the injected attributes and values are set by the user. "
