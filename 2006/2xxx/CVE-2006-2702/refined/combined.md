How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# WordPress: Arbitrary command execution — GLSA **200606-08**

WordPress fails to sufficiently check the format of cached username data.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.3** |

### Background

WordPress is a PHP and MySQL based content management and publishing
system.

### Description

rgod discovered that WordPress insufficiently checks the format of
cached username data.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
commands by sending a specially crafted username. As of Wordpress 2.0.2
the user data cache is disabled by default.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest available version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.3"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-26 03:44:31 UTC  ``` To be confirmed by a quick audit or a test (it's a bit tricky).  The code is too long to be reasonnably pasted here; please see the URL <http://retrogod.altervista.org/wordpress_202_xpl.html>  Finally, rgod manages to inject shell code, but it's hard to do, and it may depend on the configuration. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Peter Westwood    2006-05-26 04:11:43 UTC  ``` FYI AFAIK this won't work on a default install as the cache of db data is not enabled in 2.0.2 unless the user enables it.  It would affect 2.0.1 though as it does have the cache enabled by default if i recall correctly (or that may have been 2.0) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-26 10:56:28 UTC  ``` And since 2.0.1 is no longer in the tree, this seems like a moot point.  Security team, wouldn't you agree?  I have verified, as Peter has already mentioned, the cache is not on, unless enabled by the user. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Peter Westwood    2006-05-26 14:39:58 UTC  ``` This is now patched upstream on the 2.0 branch for a future 2.0.3 release:  <http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3797>  I don't know when the release is targetted for yet though. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-30 21:08:56 UTC  ``` It's still vulnerable, just not in default configuration hence the C rating above.  Aaron would you prefer to extract patch from CVS or wait for the upstream release? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Peter Westwood    2006-06-01 02:04:28 UTC  ``` v2.0.3 is now released with the fix for this included.  See: wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Wolf Giesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 02:15:46 UTC  ``` BTW, it eludes me how we can have phpBB masked and this one in stable... ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 09:34:27 UTC  ``` web-apps please bump. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 14:02:10 UTC  ``` Coming right up.  I'll have it in the tree shortly. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Aaron Kulbe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 14:41:37 UTC  ``` Bumped. Marked stable on amd64.  Yes, I'm on the arch team. :)  Call in the cavalry.  Let's have some keywording fun. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 16:17:02 UTC  ``` Hi arches,  you can go and stabilize wordpress-2.0.3 please ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 16:17:57 UTC  ``` amd64 already done, this is just for Koon's statistics ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Joshua Jackson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 21:03:38 UTC  ``` x86 is done  ^.^ ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-01 22:03:23 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Gustavo Zacarias (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-02 06:44:34 UTC  ``` sparc stable.  ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  René Nussbaumer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-03 02:45:30 UTC  ``` stable on hppa ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-03 05:32:16 UTC  ``` good, ready for GLSA ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  frilled    2006-06-07 09:43:21 UTC  ``` Might be even A3 if the bundled version is affected, too. Quite some php apps use gd. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  frilled    2006-06-07 09:45:25 UTC  ``` Sorry, wrong bug from cache :( ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-08 21:07:29 UTC  ``` Peter/Aaron is there any way for a site admin to globally enable/disable this feature? (As I can't seem to find it) ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Peter Westwood    2006-06-09 02:39:09 UTC  ``` You don't/can't globally enable it for all installs.  You enable it on an install by install basis in wp-config.php with:  define('ENABLE_CACHE',True);  You can force it off (although it is off by default) with:  define('DISABLE_CACHE',True); ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-06-09 14:17:33 UTC  ``` GLSA 200606-08 , thanks everybody and particularly jaervosz. ``` |  |
