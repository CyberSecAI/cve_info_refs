Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2006-2275:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SCTP driver did not correctly buffer incoming packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper handling of incoming packets within the SCTP driver. Specifically, the driver fails to manage buffering when receiving a large number of small messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can send a large number of small messages to a receiver application that cannot process the messages quickly enough. This can lead to a deadlock on the target machine, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
Remote, network-based attack. The attacker sends a large volume of small messages to an SCTP socket on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send network packets to an SCTP socket on the target system. No special privileges on the target system are needed for exploitation. The attacker simply needs to send a flood of small messages to the target.
