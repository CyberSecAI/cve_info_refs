  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2410",
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in `raydium_log` and `raydium_console_line_add` due to use of `vsprintf` with a fixed-size buffer. Format string vulnerability in `raydium_log` due to calling `raydium_console_line_add` with the format string directly instead of using it as the format argument. NULL function pointer dereference in `raydium_network_netcall_exec`. Buffer overflow and invalid memory access in `raydium_network_read`.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer overflow",
        "Format string vulnerability",
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Invalid memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution possible through buffer overflows. Program crash due to NULL pointer dereference. Invalid memory access leading to unpredictable behavior.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via network packets to both server and client (for buffer overflows and format string)",
         "Remote attack via network packets specifically to the client (for the second buffer overflow/memory access)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to vulnerable server or client. Specifically crafted network packets are required for exploitation."
