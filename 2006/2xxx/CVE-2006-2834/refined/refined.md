Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-2834

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in the `common.php` file of gnopaste versions 0.5.3 and earlier. The `root_path` parameter within the `common.php` file is vulnerable to remote file inclusion, which can allow an attacker to include malicious scripts from a remote server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application improperly handles user-supplied input, specifically the `root_path` parameter, allowing inclusion of remote files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, or further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `common.php` file, using the `root_path` parameter to include a malicious file from an attacker-controlled server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable gnopaste instance.
- Ability to host a malicious file: The attacker needs a server to host the malicious file that will be included into the vulnerable gnopaste application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit requires the `gnopaste_path` to be known. The attacker needs to know where gnopaste is installed within the target webserver's directory structure.
- The provided exploit example uses `SHELLCODE_URL.txt`, which needs to point to the attacker's malicious PHP script.
