Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when editing wiki pages. Specifically, the application doesn't sanitize or encode the `<script>` tags and other HTML special characters, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored and executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. This means that malicious script is stored within the application's database, leading to the execution of the script every time the affected page is viewed by a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a wiki page.
- **User compromise:** When other users visit the affected page, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing of session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying malicious or misleading content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Widespread Impact:**  As the injected script is stored persistently, the vulnerability can affect any user who views the compromised page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the web interface to edit a wiki page.
- **Malicious Code Insertion:**  The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript, specifically using `<script>` tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Account with Editing Rights:**  The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to edit at least one page on the WikiNi installation. The description notes that this is common in most Wiki setups.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Software:** WikiNi version 0.4.2 and below.
- **Vendor Notification:** The vulnerability was reported to the developers more than two months prior to this posting, but no fix or response was received.
- **Prevalence:** The software was reportedly used on more than 100,000 pages according to Google at the time of discovery, potentially exposing a large number of users to this vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS base score is 6.8, with high scores for exploitability.
- **CWE:** The CWE is CWE-79, which is "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
