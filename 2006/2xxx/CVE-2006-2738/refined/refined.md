Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a default user account ("mailadmin") with a known, default password ("secret") and a shell access (/bin/bash) within the Open-Xchange Collaboration and Integration Server environment. This default configuration is present in Open-Xchange-LDAP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The presence of a default user with a well-known password allows unauthorized access.
*   **Unrestricted Shell Access:** The "mailadmin" user having /bin/bash as a login shell provides a direct way to interact with the server's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data such as appointments, contacts, tasks, email messages, bookmarks, and documents.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:**  An attacker could modify or delete data stored within Open-Xchange.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** An attacker could disrupt the service by deleting critical data or otherwise impacting normal operations.
*   **Remote Access:** Since the server is likely accessible via web browser and other fat clients (e.g., MS Outlook) this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by attempting to log in to the server using the default "mailadmin" credentials from anywhere with network access.
*   **Web Interface/Fat Clients:** As the service is accessible through multiple interfaces, the attack can come from those access points using the default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Open-Xchange server.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of the default username ("mailadmin") and password ("secret").
*   **No Authentication Required:** The default credentials bypass the standard authentication requirements for the user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory specifically mentions this vulnerability is found in the open-source version of Open-Xchange.
*   The advisory recommends changing the password and login shell of the "mailadmin" user and not trusting default installations.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2006-05-18, and it was also published on golem.de on 2006-05-19.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.5.

**In summary:** This CVE describes a critical vulnerability due to default credentials in Open-Xchange, providing an attacker with remote access and partial control of the system with minimal requirements.
