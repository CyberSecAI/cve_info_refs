```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses a variable to define the path to an included file in server.php, and this variable is controllable by the attacker via the 'bhconfig[bhfilepath]' parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, allowing them to execute malicious code on the server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with the 'bhconfig[bhfilepath]' parameter pointing to a remote file hosted by the attacker.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
