Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-2659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `libs/comverp.c` file of Courier MTA. It's related to how the software handles usernames containing the "=" (equals) character during encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of the "=" character in usernames during encoding. This likely leads to an infinite loop or excessive resource consumption when processing such usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can cause high CPU consumption on the server, making it unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted emails to a mail gateway running a vulnerable version of Courier MTA.
*   The email must contain a username with an "=" character to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending emails through the network.
*   No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, just the ability to send email to the affected server.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Courier MTA version 0.53.2.
*   Patches were backported for earlier versions of Courier.
*   The issue was reported on multiple platforms, including Debian and Gentoo.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed by the upstream author of Courier MTA.

**Summary:**

CVE-2006-2659 describes a denial of service vulnerability in Courier MTA caused by improper handling of usernames containing the "=" character during encoding. This allows remote attackers to cause excessive CPU consumption by sending specially crafted emails.
