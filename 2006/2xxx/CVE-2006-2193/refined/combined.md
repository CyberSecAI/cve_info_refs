How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2006-2193

| **Name** | CVE-2006-2193 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Buffer overflow in the t2p\_write\_pdf\_string function in tiff2pdf in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with a DocumentName tag that contains UTF-8 characters, which triggers the overflow when a character is sign extended to an integer that produces more digits than expected in an sprintf call. |

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : none or remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2656 CVE-2006-2193
Debian Bug     : 369819

Several problems have been discovered in the TIFF library.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2006-2193

    SuSE discovered a buffer overflow in the conversion of TIFF files
    into PDF documents which could be exploited when tiff2pdf is used
    e.g. in a printer filter.

CVE-2006-2656

    The tiffsplit command from the TIFF library contains a buffer
    overflow in the commandline handling which could be exploited when
    the program is executed automatically on unknown filenames.

For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-7woody2.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.2-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

```
Package: libtiff-tools
Version: 3.8.2-3
Severity: important

I've a segfault with tiff2pdf when I try to convert a tiff file with a
DocumentName tag which contains utf-8 characters.
Here's a faulty tiffinfo output:

TIFF Directory at offset 0x7d2758 (8202072)
  Subfile Type: (0 = 0x0)

  DocumentName: /home/gpe/Documents/Spéléo/Lot/CDS46/Bulletins/Bull. n°7/Bulletin_CDS46_07_001.tiff

With the same file but with the DocumentName tag without utf-8 characters
there is no problem.

I have successfully reproduced this problem and reported it upstream.
They are usually pretty responsive about fixing problems, so hopefully
we will have a fix soon.  Thanks for your report.

```

Hi!

This has been assigned [CVE-2006-2193](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2193). This is the Ubuntu patch:

  <http://patches.ubuntu.com/patches/tiff.tiff2pdf-octal-printf.patch>

which fixes the sprintf to use a char-sized number instead of an
integer-sized, so that e. g. -1 ends up as \377 instead of
\37777777777, and the 5-byte buffer isn't overflown.

(Patch contains our changelog in the header).

Thanks,

Martin

# libTIFF: Multiple buffer overflows — GLSA **200607-03**

libTIFF contains buffer overflows that could result in arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.2-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

### Description

A buffer overflow has been found in the t2p\_write\_pdf\_string function
in tiff2pdf, which can been triggered with a TIFF file containing a
DocumentName tag with UTF-8 characters. An additional buffer overflow
has been found in the handling of the parameters in tiffsplit.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted TIFF
file, resulting in the possible execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r1"
```
### References

* [CVE-2006-2193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2193)
* [CVE-2006-2656](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2656)

**Release date**

July 09, 2006

**Latest revision**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
