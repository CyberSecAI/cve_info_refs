Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2536:

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability exists in Destiney Links Script v2.1.2, a PHP-based link management script.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a combination of:

1.  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the search and "Add a Site" forms. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
2.  **Path Disclosure:** The script is prone to full path disclosure errors due to direct calls to files in the `/include/` folder and `/themes/original/` folder. Additionally, URL manipulation of `index.php` can expose the server's internal paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Due to the lack of input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially compromising users' browsers when they view the data.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Full path disclosure vulnerabilities can reveal sensitive system information, including directory structures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **XSS:** An attacker could perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Executing arbitrary code within the user's browser context.
2.  **Path Disclosure:** An attacker could gain knowledge of the server's file structure and internal file paths, which could aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **XSS:** By injecting malicious javascript/html code into the search or "Add a Site" form fields.
2.  **Path Disclosure:** By directly accessing the files in the `/include/` or `/themes/original/` directories or manipulating the `show` parameter in `index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable web application, specifically the search and 'Add a Site' forms and be able to manipulate URL parameters.
*   No special privileges on the server are needed to execute the attack.
*   Attack can be performed remotely over the web.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability details are described as follows:
*   Files called directly from `/include/` and `/themes/original/` show path disclosure errors.
*   Input data in search and add site forms are not sanitized, allowing for XSS.
*   URL injection in `index.php` can lead to path disclosure.
    *   Example URL: `http://links.destiney.com/index.php?show=pop'` results in error messages that contain full path disclosure.
