0x01 Summary
YapBB is a OpenSource Web Forum written in php.

This web program is vulnerable to sql injection attack.
So malicious attacker can get Every nicknames(id), passwords for this YapBB.
Let's see the codes ~!

- Php5 ( magic\_quotes\_gpc = On )
0x03 Codes
~/YapBB-1.2-Beta2/YapBB/find.php:
-
..
34: $userBool = $HTTP\_POST\_VARS["choice"]=="user"; // if choice == 'user'
36: $userpostBool = !empty($HTTP\_GET\_VARS["userID"]); // userID == '[inject sql]'
..
119: else if ($userpostBool)
120: {
128: $postRes = $postQuery->select("SELECT p.date, t.id, t.description, u.nickname FROM " .
$cfgDatabase['post'] . " AS p, " . $cfgDatabase['topic'] . " AS t, " .
$cfgDatabase['user'] . " AS u WHERE t.id = p.topicid AND p.posterid = $userID AND
u.id = p.posterid GROUP BY p.topicid ORDER BY p.date DESC LIMIT 50"); // execute sql!
