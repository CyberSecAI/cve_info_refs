Can you confirm this? Doing a quick grep of the 1.0.2 source code finds no
occurace of "viewpro" at all. The line above also happens to be exactly
the same as your DevBB disclosure, suggesting this may be a bad cut/paste?
Additionally, in the subsequent posting you refer to additional scripts
being affected:
/portfolio.php?cat\_id=[XSS]
/portfolio\_photo\_popup.php?id=[XSS]
Secunia apparently wasn't able to validate all of the XSS but instead
found one SQL injection issue: http://secunia.com/advisories/19813/
Can you confirm or clarify any of the above?

```

here's the Bugtraq post.  basically I concur with Secunia's interpretation
as referenced by Jericho in his Bugtraq followup.

Subject: Re: Instant Photo Gallery <= Multiple XSS

security curmudgeon mentioned:

>  /portfolio.php?cat_id=[XSS]

Based on source inspection of 1.0.2, this parameter is cleansed.

line 31 of portfolio.php says:

  $catId = $dbFilter->db_clean_input($_GET['cat_id'], 'integer');

which looks like it's going to do input validation as an integer.

BUT... did it do this properly?

Let's go to the definition for db_clean_input...

includes/classes/class_db_input_filter.php:

> class db_input_filter{
>
>...
>
>    function db_clean_input($input, $inputType, $quoteValue=1){
>
>        $this->input = $input;
>        $this->inputType = $inputType;
>
>...
>
>        switch($this->inputType) {
>            case 'integer':
>                if(ereg("^[0-9]+$", $this->input)) {
>                    $this->input = (int)$this->input;
>                } else {
>                    $this->errorMsg = "Input does not match specified type (integer).";
>                    return false;
>                }

Notice the ereg() call.  It cleanses the input ONLY if it consists of
all digits.  Otherwise, the function returns 'false'.  The program
doesn't check if a bad value was provided, but still, this would have
the effect of setting the $catId variable to a blank value.

In February 2006, the developer also offered a "IPG Security Patch
1.0.1" which includes the portfolio.php file that is now in 1.0.2, so
maybe the portfolio.php/cat_id vector only applies to versions of
Instant Photo Gallery BEFORE 1.0.2.

portfolio_photo_popup.php / id is more clear:

>$image_id = isset($_POST['id'])?$_POST['id']:$_GET['id'];
>
>count_click($image_id);

and in includes/functions/fns_std.php:

>function count_click($image_id){
> db_connect();
>	$sql = "SELECT * FROM " . PDB_PREFIX . "image_ratings WHERE id = " . $image_id;

So, we have direct SQL injection using the "id" parameter, which
produces resultant XSS if the SQL query is malformed in an
XSS-friendly fashion.
