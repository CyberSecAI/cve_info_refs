      "source": "www.kb.cert.org_1bae1792_20250125_220223.html",
      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in various Domain Name System (DNS) implementations. The impacts of these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or cause a DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities were discovered using the PROTOS DNS Test Tool, which simulates hostile input to the DNS implementation by sending invalid and/or abnormal packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of invalid and/or abnormal DNS packets"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, gain access to sensitive information, or cause a DNS implementation to behave in an unstable/unpredictable manner. Exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote attacker to take control of a DNS server. Once a DNS server is compromised, the attacker may be able to launch attacks on other, unaffected DNS servers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending invalid and/or abnormal DNS packets"
