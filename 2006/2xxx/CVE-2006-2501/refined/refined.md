    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2501",
      "description": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Sun ONE and Sun Java System Applications. The vulnerability occurs because the web servers do not adequately validate the contents of the HTTP REFERER header before using the contents in the default error page. This may allow an unprivileged local or remote user to steal cookie information, hijack sessions, or cause a loss of data privacy between a client and the server.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the web server's failure to properly validate the contents of the HTTP Referer header before including it in the default error page.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in a user's browser, leading to the reading or modification of web page content, stealing of cookies, or hijacking of user sessions.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that includes a script in the referer header, then tricking a user into visiting the URL. The vulnerable server will then include the malicious script from the referer header in its error page, which is then executed by the user's browser.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a specially crafted URL."
