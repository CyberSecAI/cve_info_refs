{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the victim's browser (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions. Additionally, an attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL Injection), potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to `week.php`, `month.php`, and `event.php` with malicious JavaScript in the `LoName` and `AddressLink` parameters.",
      "HTTP GET requests to `month.php`, `day.php`, `event.php` and various admin files like `delCalendar.php`, `delAdmin.php`, `delAddress.php`, and `delCategory.php` with malicious SQL code in the `query`, `ID`, `CalendarDetailsID`, `AdminUserID`, and `EventLocationID` parameters."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, typically over the network. No authentication or specific user privileges are mentioned as required to exploit these vulnerabilities."
