      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a logic flaw in how Mozilla Firefox handles onKeyDown and onKeyPress events, allowing a malicious script to redirect user keystrokes to a hidden file upload field.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of keyboard events",
          "Ability to change focus between onKeyDown and onKeyPress",
          "Lack of restrictions on scripts manipulating focus on file input fields"

        "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the victim's system by composing a file path into the hidden file input field and then submitting the form.",

          "Focus switching on specific keyboard events"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could steal files from the users' computer if the attacker knew the full pathnames to the desired fileis and could create a pretext that would convince the user to type long enough to produce all the necessary characters.",

          "Lack of proper input sanitization of file upload fields",
          "Ability to disable controls during onkeydown events to filter input"
