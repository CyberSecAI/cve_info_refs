How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Focus change allowed between onKeyDown and onKeyPress,
allowing attacker to read arbitary files,
abusing <input type=file> with user input
From: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@dione.ids.pl>
To: bugtraq@securityfocus.com, full-disclosure@lists.grok.org.uk
Date: Sun, 11 Feb 2007 21:00:45 +0100 (CET)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.58.0702112047050.30989@dione>
There is an interesting logic flaw in Mozilla Firefox web browser.
The vulnerability allows the attacker to silently redirect focus of
selected key press events to an otherwise protected file upload form
field. This is possible because of how onKeyDown / onKeyPress events are
handled, allowing the focus to be moved between the two. If exploited,
this enables the attacker to read arbitrary files on victim's system.
This was tested with 2.0.0.1. Opera is most likely not vulnerable;
Microsoft Internet Explorer is not vulnerable as-is, but might be
vulnerable to a variant of the attack.
All INPUT TYPE=FILE form fields enjoy the benefits of added protection to
prvent scripts from arbitrarily choosing local files to be uploaded to the
server, and automatically submitting the form. For example, .value
parameter cannot be set or changed, and any changes to .type reset the
contents of the field.
Unfortunately, Firefox allows a malicious script to redirect carefully
selected, individual user keystrokes to a hidden file upload field, in
order to compose a particular filename, then submit the form. User
interaction is required, limiting the impact somewhat - but any website
where the user can be reasonably expected to enter some text (a
keyboard-controlled web game, a blog posting or commenting interface) can
attempt to exploit the vulnerability, and eventually succeed with one user
or another.
A quick and naive demonstration of the problem (Firefox on Windows is
required; depends on scancode values, so not all keyboards may be
supported):
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focusbug/>
(Ta-dah again)
/mz
---
And indeed - here's a MSIE 7.0 demo:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focusbug/ieversion.html>
Somewhat less pretty and straightforward, but equally sad.

Actually, MSIE doesn't require drive specification in the filename, and
will probably accept relative paths as well (so you might not need \
either when picking files from the desktop or 'my documents' or whatnot).
Firefox won't settle for a path without drive specification (but it will
accept SMB requests ;-) . On \*nix systems, of course, aiming /etc/passwd is
easier than C:\whatever.
The problem with intercepting address bar input is that you can't echo the
entered text back there without unloading the current document and its
scripts; in my examples, I tried to make sure that it's hard for the user
to notice that his input is not going where it should (in MSIE example,
this includes simulation of a blinking cursor).

Paul Szabo pointed out that this is related to exploits posted by Charles
McAuley and Bart van Arnhem in June 2006 ([CVE-2006-2894](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-2894)). These guys did
not demonstrate a complete attack, and their examples do not seem to work
well with MSIE 7 (which might be because of a half-assed attempt to fix
the problem, or perhaps not) - but a credit quite certainly is due.

So this is branch-only, since on trunk we can't type into password inputs, right?
Could we somehow enforce that at textfield that's part of a password input only reacts to keypress if it got the keydown as well? That seems like the right approach here...Flags: blocking1.8.1.3?Flags: blocking1.8.1.2?Flags: blocking1.8.0.11?Flags: blocking1.8.0.10?

Boris - password inputs, or file inputs? Also, MSIE uses the policy you propose, but this is not a sufficient fix - a variant of this attack for MSIE7 selectively takes focus away from an off-screen file input field to perform the same attack, in a somewhat less glamorous manner.
This could work if you also prevent scripts from installing onkey\* handlers on file inputs, and reading .value of such fields.
The only other option I see is to simply prevent scripts from focusing on file input fields altogether.

You mean you can only select files via the file open dialog, not by typing paths?

Yes.
Unfortunately, an number of sites rely on reading file input contents, so we can't change that easily.

uh. The path is none of their business. I may give them that file, but I may not want to disclose the path, and with it my username, local disk organization etc..
Which sites are that and what are they using it for? Detection of file type using extension, to predict whether the file will be accepted? We could either

This probably explains why the core of the problem wasn't fixed for

to manipulate focus and read contents of file input fields, instead.

I don't think this is accurate. [Bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") is about temporarily disabling control to prevent it from receiving certain keystrokes.
This one is about altering keyboard focus to redirect keystrokes from a regular text input box into a file input box.
To make things worse, [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") is marked as a duplicate of [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls"), which is quite unrelated (hiding file input controls by altering their opacity).
There were several other variants reported in the meantime (selectively blocking events by returning false on key event handler, etc), but they all seem different, and now they all lead to 258875, which is really unrelated?

Jesse! You marked [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") a dup of [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls"), which is decisively a \*different\* problem, and it's still dupped. The fact that reports have been \*wrongly\* dupped [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") and/or [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls") is exactly the mismanagement that has been criticized (see [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=370092#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Focus change between onKeyDown and onKeyPress, allowing to read arbitary files using <input type=file> (Zalewski Firefox focus stealing vulnerability)")).

From: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@dione.ids.pl>
Subject: Firefox/MSIE focus stealing vulnerability - clarification
Date: Mon, 12 Feb 2007 00:01:56 +0100 (CET)
After some research, I can offer this clarification:
1) The MSIE 7 attack vector I described is a distinctive, new
vulnerability that differs from the attack reported by Charles
McAuley and Bart van Arnhem. Attacks described by them were
fixed in MSIE7 (although MSIE6 is still exposed to the original
flaw).
My vulnerability attacks the same form control, but in a different
manner. Again, the demo for this vulnerability is here:
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focusbug/ieversion.html>
2) The Firefox attack vector is related to the Charles' [CVE-2006-2894](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-2894),
which in turn was a rediscovery of a problem known to Mozilla since
2000 (!); attempts to fix it in official releases failed because the
problem was repeatedly marked as a duplicate of a too narrowly
defined issue with control hiding. A broader redesign probably
eliminated the issue in development branches, but it still affects
Firefox 1.5 and 2.0.
This can be considered an independent rediscovery and a more
practical demonstration of a previously reported vulnerability.
The exploit is here: <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focusbug/index.html>

You're right, this isn't exactly a dup of [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown"). But the result is the
same: if you can get a visitor to type enough characters into your web page,
you can read her files.
[Bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") is marked as a duplicate of [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls") because the solution we chose
in that bug for trunk also takes care of [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown"). We could have marked bug
56236 as "Fixed" rather than "Duplicate of [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls")"; either way, you'd have
to read the comments there to understand how and where it is fixed.
If we decide to take some other fix for [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown") on branch, we'll need to keep
in mind that disabling the control is not the only exploit mechanism, and that
focus-switching works as well.

I happen to agree, and that's [bug 143220](/show_bug.cgi?id=143220 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Script can get the value of a file control, including the path").
But you don't need the whole path to build up a filename; you only really need to keep track of what the last bit is. And you can even do that without ever reading the .value -- just keep track of the key events and all.

Yeah, I think we should restrict focus() calls on branch (no need on trunk though).
Either we could disable it entierly, or we could make it such that calling focus() empties the current value?

A malicious page that can get you to type a bunch of text would have no trouble getting you to click something (that happens to be, but doesn't look like, a file upload control) before typing.

Not sure if this is the correct place to suggest this, but would a better solution in the long run be to present a warning box to the user anytime a local file is going to be uploaded to a webserver? Firefox comes out of the box with 2 or 3 fairly inane security warnings about simple everyday things like form data... I think a local file upload would also be a good thing to be warned about. If this warning was already in place, the above bug (and future ones like it) would not be so much of an issue.

I'd say we catch them a step ahead of that. If we can either warn the user of the input action, or restrict actions of this input type somehow, that would probably be safer, or I could be blabbering on about the impossible/irrelevant.

Smaug, any chance you could look at this one? I'm not sure what's easier here, prevent focus changes while handling certain events, or force all events relating to a single key press to go to the element where the key event sequence was started.Assignee: jst → Olli.Pettay

Attached patch

[changing the way .focus() works with <input type="file">](attachment.cgi?id=260809&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=260809&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=370092&attachment=260809)

this makes fileinputcontrol.focus() to focus the button, not the text
input field. Tabbing and clicking the text input field does still work.
Would this be good enough workaround for branches?
(I tried to hack keydown, keypress and keyup events too, but that patch
started to become very ugly and hackish.)

I think that would fix this bug but not [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown"), which has the same impact on security.

Would that make it impossible to use the textfield in a
<input type="file" onfocus="this.focus()">
? That might be ok, but worth checking...

Actually with the patch and having capturing focus listener in an ancestor, it is possible to get "too much recursion" :(
Better patch and a testcase coming.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
In the page at www.lemure.net/~chuck/hiddenForm\_moz.html you can see a sample
code that demonstrates this problem. By filtering out keyboard events in a
specific order, it is possible to for a webpage to specify the file wanted for
upload. By combining this with CSS, the upload dialog becomes invisible and the
user in unaware of the fact that they are entering a file.
If this is combined with a website related to technical discussion or similar
that has users entering a lot of / \ and : then it becomes somewhat trivial to
upload files.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
In the problem url specified, enter text into the text box. If a user types the
correct character, it will be captured and send focus to the file upload dialog.
This allows a webpage to specifiy a file name, in this example, C:\boot.ini.
Actual Results:
file upload
Expected Results:
Prevent shifting focus to/from file upload widget.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-32

## File input focus stealing vulnerability

Announced
October 18, 2007
Reporter
hong, Charles McAuley
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.8
* SeaMonkey 1.1.5

### Description

A user on the Sla.ckers.org forums named **hong** reported
that a file upload control could be filled programmatically by
switching page focus to the label before a file upload form control
for selected keyboard events. An attacker could use this trick to steal files
from the users' computer if the attacker knew the full pathnames to the desired
fileis and could create a pretext that would convince the user to type
long enough to produce all the necessary characters.

This is a variant on a similar problem reported by **Charles
McAuley** and independently rediscovered by **Michal
Zalewski** that was fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.4.

[Proof of concept HTML](attachment.cgi?id=272969)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=272969&action=edit)

Initially a mostly vague flaw was reported to full-disclosure here:
<http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2007-06/0646.html>
It wasn't clear in the initial thread if this vulnerability could be used to actually do anything useful other than steal everything that a user types. I did some investigation into this flaw and came up with a PoC that is able to selectively steal user keypresses. I'm attaching the PoC.
I verified this with Firefox 2.0.0.5

This looks pretty similar to [bug 370092](/show_bug.cgi?id=370092 "RESOLVED FIXED - Focus change between onKeyDown and onKeyPress, allowing to read arbitary files using <input type=file> (Zalewski Firefox focus stealing vulnerability)"). See also [bug 56236](/show_bug.cgi?id=56236 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - possible to selectively allow chars into file upload control by disabling control onkeydown").
I can't reproduce on the trunk, due to the fix for [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls").

I've created an online demo that shows more clearly how this security
vulnerability can be exploited. User keystrokes are redirected from
the textarea to the file input element by associating a label with the
file input and capturing appropriate keydown, keyup and keypress events.
You can view the online demo here: <http://pseudo-flaw.net/firefox-focus-bug>

this would actually change the behavior when there is a <label> for <input type="file"> and user clicks <label>. I'll make a better patch.

This is better. text field is still focused when user clicks the <label> for
<input type="file">, but if .focus() of the <label> is called, the 'browse...'
button of the <input type="file"> is focused.
Using NS\_IMETHOD/nsresult in the method because those same are used in
nsGenericHTMLElement.

Ideally I would like to go with as simple a solution as possible and always focus the browse-button. But this is ok too.

verified 1.8.1.8
The testcase now triggers Quick-search when the user types '/'. I think this is OK since the attack script is creating key-events and directing them outside the text area. It's not a problem in normal pages, and if the user focuses on a random button and types '/' that's expected behavior.Keywords: [fixed1.8.1.8](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.8.1.8&resolution=---) → [verified1.8.1.8](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.8.1.8&resolution=---)

It's still possible:

<form>
<label>
<input type="file" name="foo" />
<br>

Try to type in the textfield.

Okay sorry, it's my first post here, I have to learn the "rules" and stuff, a bit confusing actually. So while it has to do with this bug, I still need to fill a new bug? I kinda have to get used to that though...

Well, it is not exactly the same bug.
And having separate bugs helps QA when verifying them fixed.
And btw, a minimal testcase attached using "Add an attachment" would be
great.

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By

tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-5339](/security/CVE-2007-5339),

[CVE-2007-5340](/security/CVE-2007-5340))

Flaws were discovered in the file upload form control. By tricking

a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could force

arbitrary files from the user's computer to be uploaded without their

consent. ([CVE-2006-2894](/security/CVE-2006-2894), [CVE-2007-3511](/security/CVE-2007-3511))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the onUnload event handlers were

incorrectly able to access information outside the old page content. A

malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data (such as passwords), of the next loaded web

page. ([CVE-2007-1095](/security/CVE-2007-1095))

Stefano Di Paola discovered that Thunderbird did not correctly request

Digest Authentications. A malicious web site could exploit this to

inject arbitrary HTTP headers or perform session splitting attacks

against proxies. ([CVE-2007-2292](/security/CVE-2007-2292))

Eli Friedman discovered that XUL could be used to hide a window's

titlebar. A malicious web site could exploit this to enhance their

attempts at creating phishing web sites. ([CVE-2007-5334](/security/CVE-2007-5334))

Georgi Guninski discovered that Thunderbird would allow file-system based

web pages to access additional files. By tricking a user into opening

a malicious web page from a gnome-vfs location, an attacker could steal

arbitrary files from the user's computer. ([CVE-2007-5337](/security/CVE-2007-5337))

It was discovered that the XPCNativeWrappers were not safe in

certain situations. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web

page, an attacker could run arbitrary JavaScript with the user's

privileges. ([CVE-2007-5338](/security/CVE-2007-5338))

Please note that JavaScript is disabled by default for emails, and it

is not recommended to enable it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Browser Focus RIP

Mon, 12 Feb 2007 23:59:32 GMTby
[pdp](/members/pdp.html)

There was a [discussion](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Feb/0226.html) on Full-disclosure and Bugtraq about a very peculiar vulnerability in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox which can be used by attackers to trick victims into uploading local files.

It was [Michal Zalewski](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx) who brought this subject back on the table. The vulnerability he described is not new. In fact, it is a variation of an issues discovered back in 2000. The peculiar thing about it is that it was reported to Mozilla's Bugzilla back then but never fixed.

If you read about what [Michal's exploit](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/focusbug/) does, you can easily get lost, so I will try to explain the issue as clearly as I can and provide you with some [examples](https://chatbotkit.com/examples) of how it can be used in real attacks.

The only component in the DOM (Document Object Model) that allows us to send locally selected files to a remote location is the file input box, usually declared as `<input type="file"/>`. This is not a standard input field because it has a browse button that is attached at the end and also because, once inside a `multipart/form-data` form, it can selected local files. Because of these characteristics, you cannot use JavaScript to set its value to a file path of your desire. If that was possible, everybody would be able to steal and list your file system remotely when you visit a malicious website.

However, by using a clever focus diversion tricks, attackers can make certain characters, that the victim typed, to leak inside the file input field. They can achieve that by using a filter that allows and disallows keyboard events based on the key code order in the file path string that needs to be retrieved.

In simple words, when the user types characters inside some text field, they are actually typing them inside a file input box, which filters out the unnecessary characters in order to compose the desired string. Everything else, is totally emulated, so the user thinks they are typing in the right place not knowing what is actually happening. The following text translates to `/etc/shadow`, which can be used to steal that particular file:

> Bob! Check this out [http://www.[example](https://chatbotkit.com/examples).com](http://www.%5Bexample%5D(https://chatbotkit.com/examples%29.com). this is very cool: <http://www.someserver.com>. hei man, do you still need that wonderful CD I gave you long time ago?

You probably think that I am mad! Now, have a look at the following text, which shows all key characters that are required to build the file string.

> Bob! Check this out http:`[/]`/www.`[e]`xample.com. `[t]`his is very `[c]`ool: http:`[/]`/www.`[s]`omeserver.com. `[h]`ei m`[a]`n, `[do]` you still need that `[w]`onderful CD I gave you long time ago?

Black magic! The filter removes the parts that are not required and only the characters that are needed are passed into the input field.

Although quite complicated, this attack is very real and probably should be taken seriously. If the attacker places the malicious JavaScript on a critical place where users are heavily using the keyboard, the chances of composing the desired string are quite high. Think about blogs, wiki entries, forums, etc. This issue can be shipped as part of an AJAX worm which propagates on the top of MySpace, for example.

In some situations the user doesn't need to type that much text at all. They can be tricked into typing the desired string in a much clever way. For example, the following sequence of characters composes the `/etc/shadow` string: `b/etlc/shradow`. It is not obvious that this 14 character long string corresponds to the 11 character long `/etc/shadow` path. Still, the question is how the attacker can force the victim to type these characters inside the page. Well, attackers need to be creative in this case. Check this two examples:

You visit a page requires a CAPTCHA. You type the letters `b/etlc/` but you receive an error which tells you that your input was incorrect. Now you need to repeat the task and type the following sequence of characters: `shradow`.

*Quite bad! My advice to you is to be careful. If you are using MySpace turn JavaScript off if possible. Don't use your keyboard on untrusted websites.*

> Mozillaâ€™s Bugzilla back then and still, none has fixed it.

Not correct. As mentioned in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=370092 and on FD, the big was fixed on Firefox trunk, before these reports. It's not yet on the Firefox 2 branch.![Paul Rawdon](//gravatar.com/avatar/f852d08a4aff0fda77f4c7ce3026180b?s=256&d=retro)Paul RawdonRe your vulnerabilities for Fire Fox and Internet Explorer 7. Have just tried the test with Internet Explorer 6 and Sea Monkey 1.0.7 (the replacement for Mozilla) and the same applies for these two as well. Fire-Fox's replacement Minefield appears to be immune to this problem.![Luca](//gravatar.com/avatar/70f3624e5141ce2f2641a779497d3bcb?s=256&d=retro)LucaThe latest Firefox released to the public is 2.0.0.1 and it's vulnerable. So the flaw is still unpatched!![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpI am experimenting with Opera.

www.FirefoxMyths.com![Sebastian](//gravatar.com/avatar/68af617b4ca087422d8d9b35732f678a?s=256&d=retro)SebastianThere are only very few websites that \_require\_ JavaScript, so I have disabled JavaScript by default. Most serious browser vulnerabilities were, are and will be based on active contents like JavaScript, JScript, Java, ActiveX, Flash etc.![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpOK folks, I cannot reproduce the bug in Opera, although sometimes I get the feeling that it is possible. It seams that Opera is in fact the most secure browser, or maybe I am wrong.
Anyway, I will continue experimenting with my code and if I find anything interesting, I will post it here.

I don't know about Apollo... it's still in development. It will use the WebKit rendering engine, as Apple's Safari does, but I don't know the local file permissions system myself yet. A public release is still a bit aways, but such focus transfers would be a good thing to doublecheck, thanks.

I might be able to spot some problems that can be fixed before the actual release. I am a bit busy right now, but it will be interesting if we can do that.![John Dowdell](//gravatar.com/avatar/120f6678dc7990a340d3ad465602bfd3?s=256&d=retro)John DowdellThere will be a public release soon, but it's not here yet... http://www.adobe.com/go/apollo will redirect to the best page for latest info.

|  | |

I can choose what characters typed into a input type="file" are accepted by
looking at each character typed during onkeydown, and quickly disabling and re-
enabling the control if I want to reject a character. (Mozilla is already much
more secure than IE with these controls, btw.)
What's Mozilla's general strategy for file controls? From what I can tell,
it's "make it hard for css and javascript to do things to file controls". This
blocks most of the methods of attack I tried, but still doesn't guarantee that
the user is aware that something is being uploaded.

restriction on scripts that you mentioned, but I will give it a look.

Very clever. Looks like it would be hard to make a practical exploit, though.

I don't feel that this incarnation of the file upload control problem is
critical for rtm, although I do think it could be exploited by a "porn site
warning page".
Please examine [bug 57770](/show_bug.cgi?id=57770 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Using styles, clipboard to confuse text entry into file upload control") for rtm, though. My proposed fix for that bug would
cover this bug.

Tell me your are joking. This hole is now open for almost five years?!
Despite the unquestionable low severity of this issue, this needs to be fixed
with one of the next security releases. Since all kind of blogging and webbased
applications are out there, entering large amounts of text into websites is a
common behavior.
Can someone of the security team please explain while this has been kept open
so long?

This will be fixed in Firefox 1.5 Beta -- see [bug 258875](/show_bug.cgi?id=258875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Disable direct input of filename into file upload controls"). Two reasons the fix
took so long are (1) other browsers are also vulnerable and (2) the only real
fix, not letting users edit the filename field directly, reduces usability in
the non-attack case.

I was wrong when I said "This will be fixed in Firefox 1.5 Beta". It is fixed on trunk (for Firefox 3 at least), but it wasn't fixed in Firefox 1.5.0.0.

### Problem description

This update brings Mozilla Firefox to security update version 2.0.0.8

Following security problems were fixed:

* MFSA 2007-26 / CVE-2007-3844: Privilege escalation through chrome-loaded about:blank windows Mozilla researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that a flaw was introduced by the fix for MFSA 2007-20 that could enable privilege escalation attacks against addons that create "about:blank" windows and populate them in certain ways (including implicit "about:blank" document creation through data: or javascript: URLs in a new window).
* MFSA 2007-29: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption
  As part of the Firefox 2.0.0.8 update releases Mozilla developers fixed many bugs to improve the stability of the product. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
  + CVE-2007-5339 Browser crashes
  + CVE-2007-5340 JavaScript engine crashes
* MFSA 2007-30 / CVE-2007-1095: onUnload Tailgating Michal Zalewski demonstrated that onUnload event handlers had access to the address of the new page about to be loaded, even if the navigation was triggered from outside the page content such as by using a bookmark, pressing the back button, or typing an address into the location bar. If the bookmark contained sensitive information in the URL the attacking page might be able to take advantage of it. An attacking page would also be able to redirect the user, perhaps to a phishing page that looked like the site the user thought they were about to visit.
* MFSA 2007-31 / CVE-2007-2292: Digest authentication request splitting Security researcher Stefano Di Paola reported that Firefox did not properly validate the user ID when making an HTTP request using Digest Authentication to log into a web site. A malicious page could abuse this to inject arbitrary HTTP headers by including a newline character in the user ID followed by the injected header data. If the user were connecting through a proxy the attacker could inject headers that a proxy would interpret as two separate requests for different hosts.
* MFSA 2007-32 / CVE-2007-3511 / CVE-2006-2894: File input focus stealing vulnerability A user on the Sla.ckers.org forums named hong reported that a file upload control could be filled programmatically by switching page focus to the label before a file upload form control for selected keyboard events. An attacker could use this trick to steal files from the users' computer if the attacker knew the full pathnames to the desired fileis and could create a pretext that would convince the user to type long enough to produce all the necessary characters.
* MFSA 2007-33 / CVE-2007-5334: XUL pages can hide the window titlebar Mozilla developer Eli Friedman discovered that web pages written in the XUL markup language (rather than the usual HTML) can hide their window's titlebar. It may have been possible to abuse this ablity to create more convincing spoof and phishing pages.
* MFSA 2007-34 / CVE-2007-5337: Possible file stealing through sftp protocol On Linux machines with gnome-vfs support the smb: and sftp: URI schemes are available in Firefox. Georgi Guninski showed that if an attacker can store the attack page in a mutually accessible location on the target server (/tmp perhaps) and lure the victim into loading it, the attacker could potentially read any file owned by the victim from known locations on that server.
* MFSA 2007-35 / CVE-2007-5338: XPCNativeWraper pollution using Script object Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that it was possible to use the Script object to modify XPCNativeWrappers in such a way that subsequent access by the browser chrome--such as by right-clicking to open a context menu--can cause attacker-supplied javascript to run with the same privileges as the user. This is similar to MFSA 2007-25 fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.5

Only Windows is affected by:

* MFSA 2007-27 / CVE-2007-3845: Unescaped URIs passed to external programs This problem affects Windows only due to their handling of URI launchers.
* MFSA 2007-28 / CVE-2006-4965: Code execution via QuickTime Media-link files Linux does not have .lnk files, nor Quicktime. Not affected.
* MFSA 2007-36 / CVE-2007-4841 URIs with invalid %-encoding mishandled by Windows This problem does not affect Linux.
