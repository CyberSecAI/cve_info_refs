```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow exists in the Tektronix Hex Format (TekHex) backend of the BFD library due to insufficient validation of the length character in the input file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow. The `getsym()` function in `bfd/tekhex.c` doesn't validate if the length character is a valid hexadecimal character, leading to a buffer overflow when a crafted file is processed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause the application (like 'strings' utility) to crash. It may also allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "By tricking a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted file, an attacker can trigger the buffer overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted file to the target, either through direct access or by tricking the target into processing the file."
