  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2224",
      "root_cause": "The Quagga RIP daemon processes RIPv1 packets even when configured to use MD5 authentication or when RIPv1 is disabled, leading to route injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of RIPv1 packets when MD5 authentication is configured.",
        "Failure to properly disable RIPv1 functionality."
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary routes by sending RIPv1 response packets, potentially altering the router's routing table and disrupting network traffic.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending malicious RIPv1 response packets."
        ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target router.",
        "more_info": "This vulnerability is related to the improper handling of RIPv1 packets and the circumvention of configured security measures."
