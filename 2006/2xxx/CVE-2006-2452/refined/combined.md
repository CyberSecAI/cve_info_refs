| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c0)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-05-31 05:06:01 UTC  ``` Please describe the problem: CRITICAL ERROR IN GDM! : GDM Allow to an ordinary user access to "Configure Login Manager..." option if face list is enabled, here is a big security burnerability.  I test here bug in PLAIN mode with Face List and THEME Mode, the two ways have the bug.  To cause the bug (PLAIN mode with Face List):  Bye and Thanks Daniel bombayvdmo@yahoo.com.mx  Steps to reproduce: 1. Select "Configure Login Manager..." option in Action Menu. 2. Now gdm "need" the "root password", but now select something basic user in the face selector and enter your password. 3.Here is the bug, after you enter the ordinary user password GDM allow access to config, and give root permissions.  Actual results:   Expected results:   Does this happen every time?   Other information: ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c1)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 09:32:13 UTC  ```  This is now fixed in CVS head.  Now looking into 2.14 branch. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c2)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:16:59 UTC  ```  Yes, problem is in the 2.14 branch.  Now fixed there.  Now looking into 2.12 branch.   ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c3)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:33:13 UTC  ```  The problem also exists in the 2.8 branch.  I just patched the 2.8 branch as well with the fix.  Now the code disables the face browser so you can't click on it between choosing "Configure login" and entering the password - allowing the user to get to the config screen using their user password instead of the root password.  Note this problem happens only if Browser is enabled, SystemMenu is turned on, and Configurator turned on in the configuration file.  All non-default choices, though I believe many distros turn these on by default.   ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c4)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:51:14 UTC  ```  Okay, just verified that this problem does not happen in the 2.6 code, which corresponds to the gnome-2-10 branch.   note I said 2.8 branch above but I meant GDM 2.8 which corresponds to the gnome-2-12 branch, which does have the problem.    ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c5)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:59:05 UTC  ```  I will do new releases of the 2.8, 2.12, 2.14, and 2.15 branches as soon as I hear back from the vendor-sec mail alias with advise how to proceed, probably in the next day. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c6)  Federico Mena Quintero    2006-05-31 19:14:17 UTC  ``` Thanks a lot for taking care of this, Brian :) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c7)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-06-02 23:38:46 UTC  ``` :) Not problem, i'm an *nix user, this is my work ;-). ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c8)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-06-02 23:39:41 UTC  ``` :) Not problem, i'm an *nix user, this is my work ;-). ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c9)  Brian Cameron    2006-06-09 03:46:56 UTC  ```  Okay, the latest 2.8 (aka gnome-2.12), 2.14, and 2.15 releases have a fix for this problem.  Closing. ``` |  |

# GDM: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200606-14**

An authentication error in GDM could allow users to gain elevated
privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **gnome-base/gdm** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.8.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.8.0.8** |

### Background

GDM is the GNOME display manager.

### Description

GDM allows a normal user to access the configuration manager.

### Impact

When the "face browser" in GDM is enabled, a normal user can use the
"configure login manager" with his/her own password instead of the root
password, and thus gain additional privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GDM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-base/gdm-2.8.0.8"
```

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-31 04:47:20 UTC  ``` From: 	Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>  A serious exploit in GDM has been found which allows users to access the GDM configuration screen if they do the following:  1) Select "configure login manager 2) Click on their name in the face browser userlist. 3) type in the personal password instead of the root password.  Then the GDM configuration starts up.  Refer here:     <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343476>  I have fixed this bug in the 2.10, 2.12, and 2.14 branches which correspond to GDM 2.8, 2.12, and 2.14 respectively.  I have also fixed this problem in CVS head (2.15).  I plan to release new tarballs for all these branches in the next day or so, but was wondering if you could advise how I should proceed.  Should the release notes make mention of the seriousness of the problem, or should the distros be warned about the issue before it is highlighted in a release note?  Brian ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-31 04:49:19 UTC  ``` Current keywords:  gdm-2.2.5.4-r5[0]: gdm-2.8.0.7[0]: ia64 gdm-2.8.0.7-r1[0]: alpha amd64 hppa mips ppc ppc64 sparc x86 gdm-2.14.5[0]: ~alpha ~amd64 ~hppa ~ia64 ~mips ~ppc ~ppc64 ~sparc ~x86  Leonardo Boshell <leonardop@gentoo.org> appears to be handling the package these days. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  solar (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-05-31 11:48:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 88014](attachment.cgi?id=88014 "gdm-CVE-2006-2452.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=88014&action=edit "gdm-CVE-2006-2452.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=88014&action=diff "gdm-CVE-2006-2452.patch")] gdm-CVE-2006-2452.patch  This will be CVE-2006-2452  Redhat is requesting 1 week before any public announcments are made regarding this  problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c0)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-05-31 05:06:01 UTC  ``` Please describe the problem: CRITICAL ERROR IN GDM! : GDM Allow to an ordinary user access to "Configure Login Manager..." option if face list is enabled, here is a big security burnerability.  I test here bug in PLAIN mode with Face List and THEME Mode, the two ways have the bug.  To cause the bug (PLAIN mode with Face List):  Bye and Thanks Daniel bombayvdmo@yahoo.com.mx  Steps to reproduce: 1. Select "Configure Login Manager..." option in Action Menu. 2. Now gdm "need" the "root password", but now select something basic user in the face selector and enter your password. 3.Here is the bug, after you enter the ordinary user password GDM allow access to config, and give root permissions.  Actual results:   Expected results:   Does this happen every time?   Other information: ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c1)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 09:32:13 UTC  ```  This is now fixed in CVS head.  Now looking into 2.14 branch. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c2)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:16:59 UTC  ```  Yes, problem is in the 2.14 branch.  Now fixed there.  Now looking into 2.12 branch.   ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c3)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:33:13 UTC  ```  The problem also exists in the 2.8 branch.  I just patched the 2.8 branch as well with the fix.  Now the code disables the face browser so you can't click on it between choosing "Configure login" and entering the password - allowing the user to get to the config screen using their user password instead of the root password.  Note this problem happens only if Browser is enabled, SystemMenu is turned on, and Configurator turned on in the configuration file.  All non-default choices, though I believe many distros turn these on by default.   ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c4)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:51:14 UTC  ```  Okay, just verified that this problem does not happen in the 2.6 code, which corresponds to the gnome-2-10 branch.   note I said 2.8 branch above but I meant GDM 2.8 which corresponds to the gnome-2-12 branch, which does have the problem.    ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c5)  Brian Cameron    2006-05-31 10:59:05 UTC  ```  I will do new releases of the 2.8, 2.12, 2.14, and 2.15 branches as soon as I hear back from the vendor-sec mail alias with advise how to proceed, probably in the next day. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c6)  Federico Mena Quintero    2006-05-31 19:14:17 UTC  ``` Thanks a lot for taking care of this, Brian :) ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c7)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-06-02 23:38:46 UTC  ``` :) Not problem, i'm an *nix user, this is my work ;-). ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c8)  VÃ­ctor Daniel    2006-06-02 23:39:41 UTC  ``` :) Not problem, i'm an *nix user, this is my work ;-). ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=343476#c9)  Brian Cameron    2006-06-09 03:46:56 UTC  ```  Okay, the latest 2.8 (aka gnome-2.12), 2.14, and 2.15 releases have a fix for this problem.  Closing. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
