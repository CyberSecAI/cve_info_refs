    {
      "source": "security.gentoo.org_ccb47be6_20250125_085528.html",
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflows in the processing of AVI files and in the HTTP plugin.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability when processing AVI files.",
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP plugin (xineplug_inp_http.so) due to long replies from an HTTP server."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could trigger buffer overflows by enticing a user to load a crafted AVI file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges. A malicious HTTP server could also send a crafted reply, causing a crash or potentially executing arbitrary code on the client.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Loading a specially crafted AVI file.",
        "Receiving a malicious reply from a remote HTTP server."
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malformed AVI file or control a HTTP server to send a crafted response. The user must then use the vulnerable application (xine-lib) to open this file or connect to the malicious server."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow in the HTTP plugin of gxine when receiving a long HTTP reply."
      ],
      "impact": "The buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution when triggered. The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a crash by sending a long string of 'A' characters.",
       "attack_vectors": "A remote HTTP server sends an overly long response to a gxine client.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a HTTP server and have the victim connect to it using a vulnerable version of gxine. The server has to send a specific response that exceeds the buffer capacity to trigger the overflow."
