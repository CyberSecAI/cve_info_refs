{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input sanitization in the phpBB application. Specifically, the application uses `htmlspecialchars()` on user-supplied input without first verifying that the input is a string. When an array is passed instead of a string, `htmlspecialchars()` generates a PHP warning message revealing the full server path of the vulnerable script. Additionally, a negative integer passed to the 'start' parameter in SQL query leads to an SQL error.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Full Path Disclosure: Passing an array to parameters that expect strings leads to PHP warning messages revealing the full server path of the script.",
    "SQL Injection (Error Based): Passing a negative integer to a SQL LIMIT clause causes an SQL error message to be generated, potentially revealing database information."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain sensitive information including the full server path of the vulnerable scripts through the Full Path Disclosure. The SQL error may reveal the database structure and can potentially be used for further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET parameters: By sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests with array values for expected string parameters, an attacker can trigger full path disclosure.",
    "HTTP GET parameters: By providing negative integer values to `start` parameters within HTTP GET requests, an attacker can trigger SQL errors."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication or special access. The attacker only needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpBB instance."
