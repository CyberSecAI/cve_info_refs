{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Mozilla handles persisted XUL attributes, allowing them to be associated with an incorrect URL. Specifically, the `nsXULContentUtils::MakeElementURI` function treated IDs containing a colon (:) as already resolved URIs, and this could be exploited to set persist attributes for other pages, including chrome pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect URL association for persisted XUL attributes",
      "Lack of same-origin check when building URIs for persisted attributes",
       "Improper handling of IDs containing a colon in MakeElementURI",
        "Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled IDs"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could inject malicious script into a user's browser with elevated privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could set attributes such as onload on elements like <window>, which persist size/position and have an onload attribute where the attacker could inject malicious scripts which run with chrome privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Enticing a user to visit a malicious website",
      "Crafting a malicious HTML document (web page, HTML email, or HTML email attachment)"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML document that exploits the vulnerability to manipulate persisted XUL attributes. The attacker needs to induce the user to load such a document."
