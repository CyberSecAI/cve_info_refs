{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `$GLOBALS['AA_INC_PATH']` variable in multiple PHP files within the APC ActionApps CMS. This variable is used in `require_once` statements, and its value can be controlled by an attacker through HTTP GET parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files into the PHP execution context due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `AA_INC_PATH` variable.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the affected system. This includes the ability to execute malicious code, access sensitive data, modify website content, or establish a backdoor for persistent access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to numerous PHP files within the CMS. The attacker modifies the `GLOBALS[AA_INC_PATH]` parameter to point to a malicious PHP file on a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server and have access to a server where malicious PHP code can be hosted. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability."
