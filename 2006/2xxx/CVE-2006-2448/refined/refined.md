{
  "CVE-2006-2448": {
    "Description": "A flaw in the signal handling access checking on PowerPC that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or read arbitrary kernel memory on 64-bit systems.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing access_ok() checks in the PowerPC kernel's signal handling code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "The PowerPC kernel did not perform certain required access_ok() checks.",
      "In sys32_rt_sigaction() the do_setcontext32() function is missing a verify_area() call.",
        "The verify_area() call in arch/ppc64/kernel/signal.c for the Altivec specific issue is missing."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory and crash the kernel on 64-bit systems, and possibly read arbitrary kernel memory on 32-bit systems.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local user",
      "Signal return or with the sys_swapcontext or sys_debug_setcontext system calls"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access to the system."
  }
