How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-302-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

15 June 2006

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the do\_replace() function. A

local user process with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit

this to execute arbitrary commands with full root privileges.

However, none of Ubuntu's supported packages use this capability with

any non-root user, so this only affects you if you use some third

party software like the OpenVZ virtualization system. ([CVE-2006-0038](/security/CVE-2006-0038))

On EMT64 CPUs, the kernel did not properly handle uncanonical return

addresses. A local user could exploit this to trigger a kernel crash.

([CVE-2006-0744](/security/CVE-2006-0744))

Al Viro discovered a local Denial of Service in the sysfs write buffer

handling. By writing a block with a length exactly equal to the

processor's page size to any writable file in /sys, a local attacker

could cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1055](/security/CVE-2006-1055))

Jan Beulich discovered an information leak in the handling of

registers for the numeric coprocessor when running on AMD processors.

This allowed processes to see the coprocessor execution state of

other processes, which could reveal sensitive data in the case of

cryptographic computations. ([CVE-2006-1056](/security/CVE-2006-1056))

Marcel Holtmann discovered that the sys\_add\_key() did not check that

a new user key is added to a proper keyring. By attempting to add a

key to a normal user key (which is not a keyring), a local attacker

could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1522](/security/CVE-2006-1522))

Ingo Molnar discovered that the SCTP protocol connection tracking

module in netfilter got stuck in an infinite loop on certain empty

packet chunks. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the

computer to hang. ([CVE-2006-1527](/security/CVE-2006-1527))

The SCSI I/O driver did not correctly handle the VM\_IO flag for memory

mapped pages used for data transfer. A local user could exploit this

to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1528](/security/CVE-2006-1528))

The choose\_new\_parent() contained obsolete debugging code. A local

user could exploit this to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1855](/security/CVE-2006-1855))

Kostik Belousov discovered that the readv() and writev() functions did

not query LSM modules for access permission. This could be exploited

to circumvent access restrictions defined by LSM modules such as

SELinux or AppArmor. ([CVE-2006-1856](/security/CVE-2006-1856))

The SCTP driver did not properly verify certain parameters when

receiving a HB-ACK chunk. By sending a specially crafted packet to an

SCTP socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to trigger a buffer

overflow, which could lead to a crash or possibly even arbitrary code

execution. ([CVE-2006-1857](/security/CVE-2006-1857))

The sctp\_walk\_params() function in the SCTP driver incorrectly used

rounded values for bounds checking instead of the precise values. By

sending a specially crafted packet to an SCTP socket, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1858](/security/CVE-2006-1858))

Bjoern Steinbrink reported a memory leak in the \_\_setlease() function.

A local attacker could exploit this to exhaust kernel memory and

render the computer unusable (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1859](/security/CVE-2006-1859))

Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that the lease\_init() did not

properly handle locking. A local attacker could exploit this to cause

a kernel deadlock (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1860](/security/CVE-2006-1860))

Mark Moseley discovered that the CIFS file system driver did not

filter out "..\" path components. A local attacker could exploit this

to break out of a chroot environment on a mounted SMB share.

([CVE-2006-1863](/security/CVE-2006-1863)) The same vulnerability applies to the older smb file

system. ([CVE-2006-1864](/security/CVE-2006-1864))

Hugh Dickins discovered that the mprotect() function allowed an user

to change a read-only shared memory attachment to become writable,

which bypasses IPC (inter-process communication) permissions.

([CVE-2006-2071](/security/CVE-2006-2071))

The SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) driver triggered a

kernel panic on unexpected packets while the session was in the CLOSED

state, instead of silently ignoring the packets. A remote attacker

could exploit this to crash the computer. ([CVE-2006-2271](/security/CVE-2006-2271))

The SCTP driver did not handle control chunks if they arrived in

fragmented packets. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2272](/security/CVE-2006-2272))

The SCTP driver did not correctly handle packets containing more than

one DATA fragment. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2274](/security/CVE-2006-2274))

The SCTP driver did not correcly buffer incoming packets. By sending a

large number of small messages to a receiver application that cannot

process the messages quickly enough, a remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a deadlock in the target machine (Denial of Service).

([CVE-2006-2275](/security/CVE-2006-2275))

Patrick McHardy discovered that the snmp\_trap\_decode() function did

not correctly handle memory allocation in some error conditions. By

sending specially crafted packets to a machine which uses the SNMP

network address translation (NAT), a remote attacker could exploit

this to crash that machine. ([CVE-2006-2444](/security/CVE-2006-2444))

In addition, the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS update fixes a range of bugs.

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 kernel

update has been given a new version number, which requires you to

recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have

installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update

that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel

metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a

standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2006-0689)

Original Release Date: November 16, 2006

Last Revised: November 16, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-249

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the SCTP support that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial
  of service (crash) with a specific SO\_LINGER value.
* a flaw in the hugepage table support that allowed a local
  user to cause
  a denial of service (crash).
* a flaw in the hugepage table support that allowed a local
  user to cause
  a denial of service (crash).
* a flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed setting
  write permission
  for a read-only attachment of shared memory.
* a flaw in HID0[31] (en\_attn) register handling on PowerPC
  970 systems
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service.
  (crash)
* a flaw in the perfmon support of Itanium systems that
  allowed a local
  user to cause a denial of service by consuming all file
  descriptors.
* a flaw in the ATM subsystem. On systems with installed ATM
  hardware and
  configured ATM support, a remote user could cause a denial of
  service
  (panic) by accessing socket buffers memory after freeing
  them.
* a flaw in the DVB subsystem. On systems with installed DVB
  hardware and
  configured DVB support, a remote user could cause a denial of
  service
  (panic) by sending a ULE SNDU packet with length of 0.
* an information leak in the network subsystem that possibly
  allowed a
  local user to read sensitive data from kernel memory.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-4535](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4535),
[CVE-2005-4811](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4811),
[CVE-2006-2071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2071),
[CVE-2006-4093](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4093),
[CVE-2006-3741](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3741),
[CVE-2006-4997](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4997),
[CVE-2006-4623](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4623), and
[CVE-2006-0039](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0039) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0689.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x and 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.0 | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 2.x and 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerabilities directly but the underlying Linux platform may
be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

kernel security update (RHSA-2006-0710)

Original Release Date: November 22, 2006

Last Revised: November 22, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-254

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 3. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the IPC shared-memory implementation that allowed a
  local user
  to cause a denial of service (deadlock) that resulted in freezing
  the
  system.
* an information leak in the copy\_from\_user() implementation
  on s390 and
  s390x platforms that allowed a local user to read arbitrary
  kernel
  memory
* a flaw in the ATM subsystem affecting systems with installed
  ATM
  hardware and configured ATM support that allowed a remote user
  to cause a
  denial of service (panic) by accessing socket buffer memory
  after it has
  been freed
* a directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs that allowed a
  local user
  to escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via
  "..\\"
  sequences
* a flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed enabling
  write
  permission for a read-only attachment of shared memory
* a flaw in the DVD handling of the CDROM driver that could be
  used
  together with a custom built USB device to gain root
  privileges

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2006-4342](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4342),
[CVE-2006-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5174),
[CVE-2006-4997](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4997),
[CVE-2006-1864](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1864),
[CVE-2006-2071](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2071), and
[CVE-2006-2935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2935) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0710.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | See recommended actions below. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-27 11:17:00 UTC  ``` All of 2.4 and 2.6 kernels have been letting mprotect give write permission to a readonly attachment of shared memory, whether or not IPC would give the caller that permission.  SUS says "The behaviour of this function [mprotect] is unspecified if the mapping was not established by a call to mmap", but I don't think we can interpret that as allowing it to subvert IPC permissions.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c1)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-27 11:28:22 UTC  ``` The upstream fix can be found here:  <http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=b78b6af66a5fbaf17d7e6bfc32384df5e34408c8>    ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c2)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-27 17:24:15 UTC  ``` This is _not_ [CVE-2006-1524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1524). The commit message of the upstream fix is wrong.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c4)  Jason Baron    2006-06-01 15:58:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 130353](attachment.cgi?id=130353&action=diff "reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=130353&action=edit "reproducer") reproducer  better test program. returns PASS, FAIL, or ABORT.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c5)  Jason Baron    2006-08-21 20:47:19 UTC  ``` committed in stream U5 build 42.2. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel4/>    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c6)  Jason Baron    2006-09-26 14:30:00 UTC  ``` committed in stream E5 build 42.0.3   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c7)  RHEL Program Management    2006-09-27 21:32:35 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c9)  Jay Turner    2006-10-03 13:39:29 UTC  ``` QE ack for 4.5.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=190073#c11)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-10-05 19:17:20 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.
