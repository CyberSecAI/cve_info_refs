Package: cgiirc
Version: 0.5.4
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Upstream has just released 0.5.8, which fixes a buffer overflow in
client.c amongst other things. The 0.5.8 timeline can be seen here:

<http://cvs.cgiirc.org/timeline?d=300&e=2006-Apr-30&c=2&px=&s=0&dm=1&x=1&m=1>

The patches can be seen here:

<http://cvs.cgiirc.org/chngview?cn=283>
<http://cvs.cgiirc.org/chngview?cn=263>

There is no CVE assigned yet as far as I know.

0.5.8 also adds a login secret feature to help stop flooding:

Okay, I can confirm the buffer overflow.

Okay, that helped in fixing it, my upcoming patch is based
on this.

I don't know, if the security team requires this.

I have decided to not backport this for the security
release of 0.5.4. If the security team decides, that this
is needed, I leave that to them.

But AFAIK, it's only raising the DoS-burden a little.

Just as a short-term reply and for documentation reasons regarding this
issue:
The Debian package ships with a safe default configuration and is thus
not per-se vulnerable.
However, of course it is vulnerable if the configuration is changed to
use client.cgi instead of client-perl.cgi.

Yes, it is required for DSAs, and for tracking issues.

Mario: It does affect all configurations, just because the
configuration file says client-perl.cgi it doesn't stop someone
accessing client.cgi as the package builds client.cgi and puts it
into the cgi-bin directory.

Yes, i missed that in the first look iteration.
We've quite finished an intermediate security release.

Hi,

The appended patch should fix this issue.
It's based on the upstream patches in 0.5.8.

This is the result of Mario already reviewing it.
Everybody else is invited to review it too.

To create a new package:

- Place the .dpatch in debian/patches
- Add 50_client-c_bufferoverflow_fix.dpatch to
  debian/patches/
- Create a new changelog entry.

To Do / Done:

* I verified, that the above builds a fresh package
* Testing is needed
* Tag this bug "patch"
* Let the security team to their job

    Elrond

Are you going to update the package in sid as well?
Or should the package propagate via stable-security?

We're preparing a new version for sid, which of course will include the

Yes, for the first it should be okay to propagate the package via
stable-security.

Tests are done. Everything seems to work well.

Go on :)
Please make sure you did also add 50_client-c_bufferoverflow_fix to
debian/patches/00list in order to really make it active, since Elrond
did forget to mention this in his original ToDo list.

Thanks for your work & best regards

the fix has not been uploaded to unstable yet, but the BTS claims [1]

Who should we contact to help this?

(I'm working on a new upload, but having the fixed version
propagate first would really be nice.)

Thanks for maintaining cgiirc :)

Please mention the CVE ID [[CVE-2006-2148](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2148)] in the changelog; adding it
to this entry in the next revision is fine.  I think the security
teams use this to generate their "nonvuln" lists and their vuln
matrices and such.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1052-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
May 8th, 2006                           <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cgiirc
Vulnerability  : buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2148
Debian Bug     : 365680

Several buffer overflows have been discovered in cgiirc, a web-based
IRC client, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain cgiirc packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-6sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-6sarge1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cgiirc package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
