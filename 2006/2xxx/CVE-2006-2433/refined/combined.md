How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Impact: Unknown
Security Bypass
Exposure of sensitive information
Where: From remote
Solution Status: Vendor Patch
Description:
Some vulnerabilities have been reported in IBM WebSphere Application Server, where some have unknown impacts and others may disclose sensitive information or bypass certain security restrictions.
1) An unspecified security/integrity exposure exists in the HTTP request handlers.
This has been reported in version 6.0.2.x.
2) User credentials may be written into the "addNode.log" file in plain text when adding the base node into the deployment manager.
This has been reported in versions 5.0.2.x, 5.1.1.x, and 6.0.2.x.
3) An unspecified security issue affects the SOAP port.
This has been reported in versions 5.0.2.x and 6.0.2.x.
4) An unspecified vulnerability exists in the administrative console.
This has been reported in version 6.0.2.x.
5) An error in the WebSphere Common Configuration Mode and CommonArchive and J2EE Models may cause sensitive information to be displayed in the trace.
This has been reported in version 5.1.1.x.
6) A manipulated LTPA token from subjects credential can be exploited to access an EJB on Solaris systems.
Successful exploitation requires that LTPA authentication is used.
This has been reported in versions 5.0.2.x and 5.1.1.x.
7) An error may cause unintended execution of scripts when inserting certain script tags in URLs.
This has been reported in versions 5.0.2.x and 5.1.1.x.
Other issues, where some may be security-related, have also been reported.
