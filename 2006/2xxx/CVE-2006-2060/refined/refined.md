      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input in the 'name' parameter of the paysubscriptions.php file.",

       "attack_vector": "By using backspace characters in the 'name' parameter to remove the hardcoded prefix and then using directory traversal sequences such as '../', an attacker can force the inclusion of an arbitrary PHP file.",
