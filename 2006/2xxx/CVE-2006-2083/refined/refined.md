Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-2083:

**Root Cause:**
- An integer overflow exists in the `receive_xattr` function within the extended attributes patch (`xattr.c`) of rsync.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `receive_xattr` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing extended attributes.
- The vulnerable code is called from the `recv_file_list()` function, which is used when receiving files from the connected peer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the rsync daemon.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker with write access to an rsync module can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker crafts malicious extended attributes to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have write access to an rsync module on the server.
- The rsync server binary must be compiled with the configuration option `--enable-xattr-support`. This is enabled by default on Fedora Core 5 and by using the `acl` USE flag on Gentoo.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted extended attributes to the vulnerable rsync server during a file transfer.

**Additional Details:**
- The Gentoo bug report also mentions that the fix is included in rsync version 2.6.8.
- The vulnerability is present only when rsync is compiled with extended attributes support enabled (e.g. using the `acl` USE flag in Gentoo).
- Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) 200605-05 was released to address this vulnerability and recommends users upgrade to version 2.6.8 or later of rsync.
