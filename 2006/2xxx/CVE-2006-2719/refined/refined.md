{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application passes the SQL username, password, and data source details directly to Crystal Reports (.rpt) files at runtime. The SQL user account used by the application has full SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and EXECUTE rights.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Clear text storage of usernames and passwords in the SQL Server database table HR_Staff.",
      "Clear text transmission of usernames and passwords to the local SQL Server ODBC driver from the application.",
      "Lack of administrative control over users' menu options.",
      "Excessive variables available and changeable on the user end, outside network administrator control.",
      "Absence of remote validation for report access versus users.",
       "The application uses a single, highly privileged SQL account for reporting, which allows execution of arbitrary reports with full SQL permissions."

    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords, personal data) and perform unauthorized SQL operations by crafting a malicious Crystal Report file (.rpt) and executing it through the applicationâ€™s reporting module.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Craft a malicious Crystal Reports file (.rpt).",
      "Save the malicious .rpt file to a removable drive or local drive.",
      "Use the application's reporting feature and point it to the crafted .rpt file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to log in to the Jiwa Financials application, access the reporting module, and either have a local or removable drive to store and access the malicious .rpt file. The attacker does not need high-level access rights within Jiwa Financials, as the vulnerability is in how report files are processed.",
     "additional_details": "The application retrieves the SQL connection details from a Jiwalog.ini file, which is located in the user's Application Data folder. This .ini file contains the connection string needed to access the SQL server, allowing malicious users to leverage this connection in reports.The report files (.rpt) are stored on a common mapped network drive but the application allows the user to specify a report file from any mappable drive, including a local drive.  The standard stored procedures in the Jiwa distribution allow a user with the reporting account's permissions to drop primary keys from tables. The company's response downplayed the severity of the issue, focusing only on encrypting passwords in a future release, ignoring the vulnerability of being able to use an evil report. This vulnerability is present in version 6.4.14."
