## Vulnerability Details

#### RASMAN Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2370

There is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) service that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating factors for RASMAN Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2370:

* The Remote Access Connection Manager service is not started by default for all supported Microsoft Windows operating systems with the exception of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. The only service dependent upon the Remote Access Connection Manager service is the Remote Access Auto Connection Manager. For Microsoft Windows 2000, the Internet Connection Sharing service depends on the Remote Access Connection Manager service. Enabling a dependent service could cause the Remote Access Connection Manager service to start.
* On Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 systems, an attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely by anonymous users or by users who have standard user accounts. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have administrative permissions.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for RASMAN Memory Corruption Vulnerability- CVE-2006-2370:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable the Remote Access Connection Manager service**

  Disabling the Remote Access Connection Manager service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel.** Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Remote Access Connection Manager**
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop rasman & sc config rasman start= disabled`

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable the Remote Access Connection Manager service, you cannot offer routing services to other hosts in local area and wide area network environments. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that do not require the use of RASMAN for remote access and routing.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593
  + All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024
  + Any other specifically configured RPC port

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as the** [**Internet Connection Firewall**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33335)**, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Internet Connection Firewall feature in Windows XP and in Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet. In Windows XP Service Pack 2 this features is called the Windows Firewall.

  To enable the Internet Connection Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Network and Internet Connections**, and then click **Setup or change your home or small office network**. The Internet Connection Firewall feature is enabled when you select a configuration in the Network Setup Wizard that indicates that your system is connected directly to the Internet.

  To configure Internet Connection Firewall manually for a connection, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. In the default Category View, click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
  3. Right-click the connection on which you want to enable Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
  4. Click the **Advanced** tab.
  5. Click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box, and then click **OK**.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, click **Settings** on the **Advanced** tab, and then select the programs, the protocols, and the services that are required.
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and forces other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Displays a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstallation. |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows 2000\SP5\KB911280\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Microsoft Remote Access Connection Manager service vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#814644

Original Release Date: 2006-06-13 | Last Revised: 2006-06-14

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft Remote Access Connection Manager may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Microsoft describes the [Routing and Remote Access Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/rras/rras/routing_and_remote_access_service_rras_start_page.asp) (RRAS) as follows:  RRAS makes it possible for a computer to function as a network router. RRAS also provides the next generation of server functionality for the Remote Access Service (RAS) for Windows. The RRAS server functionality follows and builds upon the Remote Access Service (RAS) that was included in previous operating systems.  The Remote Access Service lets users connect to a remote computer over phone lines, so they can work as if their system were physically connected to the remote network. These services enable remote users to do activities such as send and receive e-mail, fax documents, retrieve files, and print documents on an office printer.The Remote Access Service is a native service in Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface provided by the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) supplied with Microsoft Windows. Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in registry corruption and subsequent stack memory corruption on the affected system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The attacker-supplied code would be execute with Local System privileges. Microsoft states:On Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 and Windows XP Service Pack 1, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability. In order to exploit the vulnerability on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003, an attacker must have valid login credentials to a target system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**  Microsoft has published patches for this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-025.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  In addition to the patches, Microsoft has also published a number of [workarounds](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-025.mspx#ELBAE) for this issue in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-025](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-025.mspx). Users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patch, are encouraged to implement these workarounds. |
