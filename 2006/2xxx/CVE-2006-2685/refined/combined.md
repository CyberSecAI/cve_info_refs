##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

 <http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2006/1996>

 Advisory ID : FrSIRT/ADV-2006-1996
 CVE ID : GENERIC-MAP-NOMATCH
 Rated as : High Risk
 Remotely Exploitable : Yes
 Locally Exploitable : Yes
 Release Date : 2006-05-26

 Technical Description

 Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Basic Analysis and Security
 Engine (BASE), which could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary
 commands. These flaws are due to input validation errors in the
 "base_qry_common.php", "base_stat_common.php", and
 "includes/base_include.inc.php" scripts that do not validate the "BASE_path"
 parameter, which could be exploited by remote attackers to include malicious
 scripts and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server.

 Affected Products

 Basic Analysis and Security Engine (BASE) 1.2.4 and prior

I have to disagree with the Severity of grave.  To exploit you need
to have register_globals set to on which has not been the default in
years.  We have released 1.2.5 which fixes the issue and a number of
other things.  It just gets under my skin when "researchers" find
problems, elevate how serious they are and never notify the
development team.

Sorry for my rant,
Kevin

Ok, now the bug has a minor severity. You are right, base is not
exploitable with the default installation of the package.

Yes, I am aware of it. We'll upload it in a few days. I've submitted the
bug report to inform the security team (testing distribution has also
base 1.2.4) and to explain more in deep the changes in the 1.2.5
changelog.

Well, I don't understand you Kevin. I know you are subscribed to the
package tracking system of acidbase, so I know that you receive all the
bugs submitted to the package too. If you don't agree with the severty
of a bug, you can always change it as I've just done.

Sorry this was not meant toward you.  I was speaking of St0ke and
Milw0rm.  I apologize for venting at you and the bug tracking
system.  As too changing the severity I forgot.  We have been busy
around here since my new daughter arrived Monday.

Description:
 acidbase   - Basic Analysis and Security Engine
Closes: [363548](bugreport.cgi?bug=363548) [370576](bugreport.cgi?bug=370576)
Changes:
 acidbase (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * New upstream release, wich includes the following security improvements:
      + Added XSSPrintSafe() (array safe htmlspecilchars() function) and made
        filterSql() use ADOdb qmagic()
      + Filtered all unfiltred (mainly auth system stuff) $_POST and $_GET
        variables using filterSql()
      + Santized all $_SERVER variables to be protected against XSS attacks
     These improvements fix the following security bugs:
      + Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability ([CVE-2006-1590](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1590))
        (Closes: #[363548](bugreport.cgi?bug=363548)).
      + Remote File Inclusion Vulnerabilities ([CVE-2006-2685](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2685))
        (Closes: #[370576](bugreport.cgi?bug=370576)).
 .
   * debian/patches/02_update_external_links.dpatch : updated.
 .
   * Applied part of the patch from Paul Wise <pabs3@bonedaddy.net>:
     + Remove short description from long description
     + Update copyright file with more information
 .
   * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no policy-related changes needed).
 .
   * Fix an annoying dbconfig-common error: Add dbc_dbtypes variable in
     mantainer scripts, not only in config file.
     This is related to bug #372948 (dbconfig-common: can not determine the
     database type).
 .
   * Remove ucf file under /etc/acidbase on package purge.
