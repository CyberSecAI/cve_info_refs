{
  "CVE-2006-2382": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer fails to properly calculate memory sizes when decoding UTF-8 encoded characters, leading to heap memory corruption.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap memory corruption due to incorrect memory size calculations during UTF-8 decoding.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.",
      "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email, email attachment).",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to host a malicious HTML document and persuade a user to open it."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A miscalculation of memory sizes when translating UTF-8 characters to Unicode. A size mismatch between a heap allocation and memory copy results in an exploitable heap corruption.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Heap overflow vulnerability",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.",
      "Attack vectors": "Target user browsing to a malicious web page",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires target user to browse to a malicious web page. JavaScript, Java or ActiveX do not need to be enabled."
