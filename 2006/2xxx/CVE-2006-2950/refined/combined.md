How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The domain name (without content) is available for sale by its owner through Sedo's Domain Marketplace. Any offer you submit is binding for 7 days. All quoted prices are final prices.

This domain may be listed as a fundamental term by Afnic. Domains listed as fundamental terms are subject to certain registration and trade restrictions.
It is your responsibility to make sure that all of the conditions that are specific to fundamental term domains are fulfilled before bidding and purchasing this domain. These requirements include:
• Why do you wish to register and/or trade this domain?
• What are your reasons/goals for registering/trading this domain?
After receiving these answers, Afnic may request additional documentation from the owner's registrar. Only then will Afnic determine whether or not to approve the registration/trade.
Important Notice:
In order to purchase a .FR domain and successfully transfer it into your ownership, you must have a personal address in Europe, or a business presence with an associated address in Europe.
Please note that it is a requirement of the .FR registry that any registrant of a .FR domain has a European address. If you do not meet either of these requirements, then you will have to transfer the domain to a registrar that provides a trustee service, i.e. a legal proxy address in France.
