     "summary": "The Net Portal Dynamic System (NPDS) 5.10 and earlier versions suffer from a full path disclosure vulnerability. By directly accessing specific PHP files (header.php, contact.php, or forum_extender.php), the application exposes the server's file path in error messages. This information disclosure can be used to assist in further attacks."
