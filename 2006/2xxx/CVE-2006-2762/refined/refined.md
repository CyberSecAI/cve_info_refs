Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-2762

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An uninitialized variable in the webcalendar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The core issue is the presence of an uninitialized variable within the webcalendar's PHP code.
*   **register_globals Dependency:** The vulnerability is exploitable when the PHP setting `register_globals` is turned on. This setting allows user-provided data to directly overwrite variables in the PHP script, which creates a significant security risk if not handled carefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Exploitation via HTTP:** The attacker leverages the `register_globals` PHP setting to inject malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **`register_globals` Enabled:** The PHP setting `register_globals` must be enabled on the server hosting the vulnerable webcalendar application for the exploit to work.

**Summary:** The vulnerability in webcalendar stems from an uninitialized variable that, when combined with the deprecated PHP feature `register_globals`, allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to a full compromise of the affected web application.
