## CVE-2006-2389

The provided text describes a remote code execution vulnerability, **CVE-2006-2389**, affecting Microsoft Office.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Microsoft Office Property Vulnerability
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office parses malformed properties within Office files. Specifically, when Office opens a specially crafted Office file and processes a malformed property, it can corrupt system memory, potentially enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Weakness:** Improper validation of property fields in Office documents leads to a buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Office file as an email attachment and persuade the user to open it.
    *   **Web:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted Office file designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince users to visit the website, typically by tricking them into clicking a link.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious file. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Affected Software:**
    *   Microsoft Office 2000
    *   Microsoft Office XP
    *   Microsoft Office 2003
    *   Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac
    *   Microsoft Office v. X for Mac
    *   Microsoft Project 2000
    *   Microsoft Project 2002
    *   Microsoft Visio 2002
*   **Mitigating Factors:**
    *   Users with accounts configured with fewer user rights are less impacted.
    *   On Outlook 2002 and 2003, the vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. A user must accept a prompt to "Open," "Save," or "Cancel" the attachment. Office 2000 does not have this prompt.
*   **Workaround:** Do not open or save Microsoft Office files from untrusted sources or those received unexpectedly from trusted sources.
*   **Fix:** Apply the appropriate patch from Microsoft. The update modifies how Office parses the length of a record before passing it to the allocated buffer.
