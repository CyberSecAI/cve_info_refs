How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

About Secunia........................................................8

======================================================================
1) Affected Software
\* EServ/3 version 3.25
Prior versions may also be affected.
======================================================================
2) Severity
Rating: Moderately Critical
Impact: Security bypass
Exposure of sensitive information
Where: Remote
======================================================================
3) Description of Vulnerability
Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Eserv/3, which
can be exploited by malicious users to bypass certain security
restrictions and to disclose potentially sensitive information, and
by malicious people to gain access to potentially sensitive information.
1) Directory traversal errors exist in the CREATE, SELECT, DELETE,
RENAME, COPY and APPEND commands of the IMAP service. This can be
exploited by an authenticated user to read other users' emails,
create/rename arbitrary directories on the system, and delete empty
directories.
2) A validation error of the filename extension supplied by the user
in the URL can be exploited to retrieve the source code of script
files (e.g. PHP, PL) from the HTTP server via specially crafted requests
containing dot, space and slash characters.
======================================================================
4) Solution
Update to version 3.26 or apply patch.
======================================================================
5) Time Table
15/05/2006 - Initial vendor notification.
15/05/2006 - Initial vendor reply.
31/05/2006 - Public disclosure.
======================================================================
6) Credits
Discovered by Tan Chew Keong, Secunia Research.
======================================================================
7) References
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
CVE-2006-2308 and CVE-2006-2309 for the vulnerabilities.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
