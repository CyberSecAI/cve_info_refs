      "root_cause": "Web content could access the nsISelectionPrivate interface of the Selection object and use it to add a SelectionListener. The listener would be called when the user did a \"Find\" on the page or a \"select all\".",

      "root_cause": "Content script can register a content-defined SelectionListener. When a user uses the Find Toolbar or chooses 'Select All' from the context menu, listener.notifySelectionChanged() is called. The caller of notifySelectionChanged() has chrome privileges.",
