Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-2763

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of Pre News Manager version 1.0 and earlier.
- The `id` parameter in `index.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This lack of input validation allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.  An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:**  Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Plain Text Password Retrieval:**  Specifically, an attacker can retrieve the administrator's password in plain text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` page.
- **Manipulated `id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.
- **Example URL:** `http://www.target.com/[path]/index.php?id=-1%20union%20select%201,2,3,concat(login,0x3a,password),5,6,7%20from%20admin--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through a web browser.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Understanding of SQL and HTTP:** Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques and HTTP request manipulation is required.
- **Targeted Application:** The attacker needs to target an instance of Pre News Manager version 1.0 or earlier.

**Additional Notes:**
- **`magic_quotes` Setting:** The exploit requires the PHP `magic_quotes` setting to be turned off on the server, otherwise, the exploit will be ineffective due to additional input sanitization.
- **Plain Text Passwords:** The fact that the admin password is stored in plaintext is an additional weakness.

**Mitigation:**
- **Input Validation:** The primary solution is to properly validate and sanitize the input to the `id` parameter in the `index.php` file.
- **`magic_quotes`:**  Enabling PHP's `magic_quotes` setting can mitigate the exploit, though it is not recommended as a primary long term solution. It is considered deprecated in modern versions of PHP.
- **Secure Password Storage:** Passwords should be stored using a proper hashing function, preferably with a salt to prevent password exposure in the event of a database breach.
