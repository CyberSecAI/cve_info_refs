{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The iFdate v1.2 application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before dynamically generating web pages. Specifically, input fields do not sanitize user input before displaying it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript) into the application. These scripts can then be executed in the browsers of other users who interact with the affected parts of the website, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of web pages, or the redirection of users to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Input fields: login username/password, profile editing fields, messaging, forum posts and other input boxes where user input is dynamically rendered."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into any input field. No authentication required."
