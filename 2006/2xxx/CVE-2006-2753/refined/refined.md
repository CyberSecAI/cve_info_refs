{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "MySQL 4.1 incorrectly parses strings escaped with mysql_real_escape() when used with multi-byte character sets like SJIS, BIG5 and GBK. These character sets contain valid multi-byte characters that end with the byte 0x5c, which is the backslash character in ASCII. When a client application uses one of these affected encodings without properly interpreting multi-byte characters and uses '\\'' to escape single quotes, it can result in a SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements into the MySQL server for execution, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted byte sequence is supplied as an input string parameter to a vulnerable application using a vulnerable version of MySQL.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to supply input to the application that is using the vulnerable MySQL server and the application is using multi-byte character sets."
