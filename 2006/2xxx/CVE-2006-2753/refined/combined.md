Debian Security Advisory DSA 1092-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
June 8th, 2006                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : mysql-dfsg-4.1
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-2753
BugTraq ID     : 18219

Josh Berkus and Tom Lane discovered that MySQL 4.1, a popular SQL
database, incorrectly parses astring escaped with mysql_real_escape()
which could lead to SQL injection.  This problem does only exist in
versions 4.1 and 5.0.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.11a-4sarge4.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.21-4.

Version 4.0 in the stable distribution (sarge) is also not affected by
this problem.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MySQL: SQL Injection — GLSA **200606-13**

MySQL is vulnerable to an SQL Injection flaw in the multi-byte encoding
process.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.22** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.22**revision >= **4.1.20**revision >= **4.1.21**revision >= **4.1.22**< **4.1** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

### Description

MySQL is vulnerable to an injection flaw in mysql\_real\_escape() when
used with multi-byte characters.

### Impact

Due to a flaw in the multi-byte character process, an attacker is still
able to inject arbitary SQL statements into the MySQL server for
execution.

### Workaround

There are a few workarounds available: NO\_BACKSLASH\_ESCAPES mode as a
workaround for a bug in mysql\_real\_escape\_string(): SET
sql\_mode='NO\_BACKSLASH\_ESCAPES'; SET GLOBAL
sql\_mode='NO\_BACKSLASH\_ESCAPES'; and server command line options:
--sql-mode=NO\_BACKSLASH\_ESCAPES.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-4.1.20"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-288-3: PostgreSQL client vulnerabilities

9 June 2006

PostgreSQL client vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

USN-288-1 described a PostgreSQL client vulnerability in the way

the >>'<< character is escaped in SQL queries. It was determined that

the PostgreSQL backends of Exim, Dovecot, and Postfix used this unsafe

escaping method.

For reference, these are the details of the original USN:

[CVE-2006-2313](/security/CVE-2006-2313):

Akio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling of

invalidly-encoded multibyte text data. If a client application

processed untrusted input without respecting its encoding and applied

standard string escaping techniques (such as replacing a single quote

```
>>'<< with >>\'<< or >>''<<), the PostgreSQL server could interpret the
resulting string in a way that allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary
SQL commands into the resulting SQL query. The PostgreSQL server has
been modified to reject such invalidly encoded strings now, which
completely fixes the problem for some 'safe' multibyte encodings like
UTF-8.

```

[CVE-2006-2314](/security/CVE-2006-2314):

However, there are some less popular and client-only multibyte

encodings (such as SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain

valid multibyte characters that end with the byte 0x5c, which is the

representation of the backslash character >>\<< in ASCII. Many client

libraries and applications use the non-standard, but popular way of

escaping the >>'<< character by replacing all occurences of it with

```
>>\'<<. If a client application uses one of the affected encodings and
does not interpret multibyte characters, and an attacker supplies a
specially crafted byte sequence as an input string parameter, this
escaping method would then produce a validly-encoded character and
an excess >>'<< character which would end the string. All subsequent
characters would then be interpreted as SQL code, so the attacker
could execute arbitrary SQL commands.

To fix this vulnerability end-to-end, client-side applications must
be fixed to properly interpret multibyte encodings and use >>''<<
instead of >>\'<<. However, as a precautionary measure, the sequence
>>\'<< is now regarded as invalid when one of the affected client
encodings is in use. If you depend on the previous behaviour, you
can restore it by setting 'backslash_quote = on' in postgresql.conf.
However, please be aware that this could render you vulnerable
again.

This issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like
SQL_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like
UTF-8) encodings.

```

Please see <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.50> for further

details.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* exim4-daemon-heavy
  -
  4.60-3ubuntu3.1
* postfix-pgsql
  -
  2.2.10-1ubuntu0.1
* dovecot-common
  -
  1.0.beta3-3ubuntu5.1

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* exim4-daemon-heavy
  -
  4.52-1ubuntu0.1
* postfix-pgsql
  -
  2.2.4-1ubuntu2.1
* dovecot-common
  -
  0.99.14-1ubuntu1.1

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* exim4-daemon-heavy
  -
  4.34-10ubuntu0.1
* postfix-pgsql
  -
  2.1.5-9ubuntu3.1
* dovecot-common
  -
  0.99.13-3ubuntu0.1

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
