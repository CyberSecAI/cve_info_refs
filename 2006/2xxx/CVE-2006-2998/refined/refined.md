Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `qb_path` parameter of the `post.php` script in free QBoard version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file specified by an attacker-controlled parameter.  This occurs because the `qb_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing the inclusion of remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server by manipulating the `qb_path` parameter. This allows them to take complete control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `post.php` script. The `qb_path` parameter is appended to the URL, pointing to a malicious PHP script hosted on a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Hosting Malicious Script:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP script on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.
