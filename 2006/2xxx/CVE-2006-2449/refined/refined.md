Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2006-2449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a symlink attack within the KDM (KDE Display Manager). KDM stores session type settings in user home directories. By exploiting this, an attacker can trick KDM into accessing and reading files that the user wouldn't normally have permission to access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** KDM does not properly handle symlinks when accessing the session type settings in user home directories.
- **Insufficient File Access Control:** KDM reads files based on symlinks which allows circumventing intended file access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can read sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow` (containing password hashes) or other users' private files.
- **Compromised Privacy and Security:** This can lead to the privacy compromise of another user or even the security compromise of the whole system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the KDM process is run as root, the local attacker can potentially read any file on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks in a location that KDM interacts with.
- **Knowledge of KDM behaviour:**  The attacker must know how KDM handles session settings to craft the appropriate symlink.

**Affected Systems:**
- KDM as shipped with KDE 3.2.0 up to including 3.5.3.
- Specifically mentioned are Slackware 10.0, 10.1, 10.2 and current versions. Gentoo with kdebase < 3.5.2-r2 and kdebase/kdm < 3.5.2-r1.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ludwig Nussel.
- Patches were made available for KDE versions 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and 3.4.0-3.5.3.
- The provided documents specify where to find the patches.
- Several distributions like Slackware and Gentoo released security advisories and updated packages to address the issue.
