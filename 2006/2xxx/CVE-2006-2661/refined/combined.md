| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-03-02 19:20:00 UTC  ``` Freetype integer underflow  While fuzzing some pdf files a few weeks back, I ended up finding an integer underflow in freetype2.  Upstream did commit some fixes, so this issue is somewhat public.  1.ttf will generate this error.  Patches: <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/freetype/freetype2/src/pshinter/pshglob.c?r1=1.30&r2=1.31&makepatch=1&diff_format=h> <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/freetype/freetype2/src/cff/cffload.c?r1=1.73&r2=1.74&makepatch=1&diff_format=h> <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/freetype/freetype2/src/type1/t1load.c?r1=1.104&r2=1.105&makepatch=1&diff_format=h>  The problem is the number of blue values needs to be even.  If a font file claims it's odd, freetype2 doesn't handle it well.   The crash is seen in src/pshinter/pshglob.c:psh_blues_set_zones_0()  What was basically happening is since read_count is an unsigned integer, and is decremented by 2, it is possible to cause an integer underflow by ensuring the value of read_count is an odd number.  Once read_count underflows, the loop starts dumping garbage onto the heap. Normally I wouldn't think this is exploitable as it should crash before anything exciting can happen, most graphical applications are multi-threaded, so this does worry me.  At the very least this issue is a denial of service bug.  The 2.ttf file in the testcase will also trigger a NULL pointer dereference, which I'm not considering a secuirty issue.  The patch is here:  <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/freetype/freetype2/src/base/ftutil.c?r1=1.17&r2=1.18&makepatch=1&diff_format=h>   This issue also affects RHEL3 This issue also affects RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-03-02 19:22:34 UTC  ``` [attachment 125556](attachment.cgi?id=125556 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=125556&action=edit "testcase") contains the testcase   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c2)  Matthew Barnes    2006-05-05 21:35:48 UTC  ``` RHEL 3 and RHEL 4 packages are built, will do RHEL 2.1 next week.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c3)  Matthew Barnes    2006-05-10 19:19:45 UTC  ``` RHEL 2.1 packages are built.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c4)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-15 18:00:44 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c5)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-30 19:02:59 UTC  ``` The NULL pointer dereference has been assigned [CVE-2006-2661](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2661)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=183676#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-07-18 10:05:06 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

# RHSA-2006:0500 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

freetype security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2006%3A0500)

## Topic

Updated freetype packages that fix several security flaws are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

FreeType is a free, high-quality, and portable font engine.

Chris Evans discovered several integer underflow and overflow flaws in the
FreeType font engine. If a user loads a carefully crafted font file with a
program linked against FreeType, it could cause the application to crash or
execute arbitrary code as the user. While it is uncommon for a user to
explicitly load a font file, there are several application file formats
which contain embedded fonts that are parsed by FreeType. (CVE-2006-0747,
CVE-2006-1861, CVE-2006-3467)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the FreeType font engine. An
application linked against FreeType can crash upon loading a malformed font
file. (CVE-2006-2661)

Users of FreeType should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

freetype security update (RHSA-2006-0500)

Original Release Date: August 30, 2006

Last Revised: September 13, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-176

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

FreeType is a free, high-quality, and portable font engine.

FreeType was found to contain numerous integer underflow and overflow
vulnerabilities in its font rendering engine. If an attacker could trick a
user into loading a specially constructed font file in an application linked
to a vulnerable version of FreeType, the application could possibly crash
or execute arbitrary code as the user. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-0747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0747),
[CVE-2006-1861](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1861), and
[CVE-2006-3467](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3467) to these issues.

Additionally, FreeType was found to crash when loading a malformed font file
due to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-2661](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2661) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with freetype installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | Prior to CM3.1 | Low | Upgrade to CM3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to Intuity LX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of freetype, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account
representative. Please contact your Avaya product support representative, or
dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
