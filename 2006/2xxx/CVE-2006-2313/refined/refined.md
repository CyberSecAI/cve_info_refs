{
  "cve": "CVE-2006-2313",
  "affected_versions": [
    "PostgreSQL versions before 8.1.4",
    "PostgreSQL versions before 8.0.8",
    "PostgreSQL versions before 7.4.13",
    "PostgreSQL versions before 7.3.15"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw in the multibyte character handling within PostgreSQL's string parsing routines allows certain backslash-escaped characters to be bypassed in some multibyte character encodings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of multibyte character encodings",
      "SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation/escaping"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the PostgreSQL server. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "SQL Injection via crafted input strings",
       "Client-side applications processing untrusted input without respecting its encoding."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted byte sequence as an input string parameter to the PostgreSQL server."
  },
  "additional_information": {
     "multibyte_encoding_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable with certain multibyte encodings like SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC, where valid characters can end with a backslash (\\x5c).",
    "client_side_fix": "Client-side applications need to correctly interpret multibyte encodings and use '' instead of \\' for escaping single quotes.",
    "server_side_fix": "The PostgreSQL server has been modified to reject such invalidly encoded strings and the \\' sequence is now regarded as invalid when one of the affected client encodings is in use.",
    "workaround": "There is no known workaround other than upgrading PostgreSQL."
  }
