# Security Releases for All Active Versions

| Lists: | [pgsql-announce](/list/pgsql-announce/since/200605231530) |

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today released versions 8.1.4, 8.0.8,
7.4.13 and 7.3.15.  This is an urgent update to close a security hole which
can permit a SQL injection attack on some applications running PostgreSQL.

Users are urged to apply the update as soon as reasonably possible.  Since the
update affects client functionality, most driver projects will be updating
this week as well.

Because the security issue involved is complex, we have added a section in
Techdocs to explain it: <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.52>.  Please
read this first before applying the updates.

Downloads are available on the download page:
<http://www.postgresql.org/download>.  Binaries for some platforms should be
already available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PostgreSQL: SQL injection — GLSA **200607-04**

A flaw in the multibyte character handling allows execution of arbitrary
SQL statements.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/postgresql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.0.8**< **7.4.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.0.8**= **7.4\*** |

### Background

PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database management
system.

### Description

PostgreSQL contains a flaw in the string parsing routines that allows
certain backslash-escaped characters to be bypassed with some multibyte
character encodings. This vulnerability was discovered by Akio Ishida
and Yasuo Ohgaki.

### Impact

An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL statements on the PostgreSQL
server. Be aware that web applications using PostgreSQL as a database
back-end might be used to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PostgreSQL users should upgrade to the latest version in the
respective branch they are using:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-db/postgresql
```

Note: While a fix exists for the 7.3 branch it doesn't currently work
on Gentoo. All 7.3.x users of PostgreSQL should consider updating their
installations to the 7.4 (or higher) branch as soon as possible!

# USN-288-2: PostgreSQL server/client vulnerabilities

9 June 2006

PostgreSQL server/client vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

USN-288-1 fixed two vulnerabilities in Ubuntu 5.04 and Ubuntu 5.10.

This update fixes the same vulnerabilities for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

For reference, these are the details of the original USN:

[CVE-2006-2313](/security/CVE-2006-2313):

Akio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling of

invalidly-encoded multibyte text data. If a client application

processed untrusted input without respecting its encoding and applied

standard string escaping techniques (such as replacing a single quote

```
>>'<< with >>\'<< or >>''<<), the PostgreSQL server could interpret the
resulting string in a way that allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary
SQL commands into the resulting SQL query. The PostgreSQL server has
been modified to reject such invalidly encoded strings now, which
completely fixes the problem for some 'safe' multibyte encodings like
UTF-8.

```

[CVE-2006-2314](/security/CVE-2006-2314):

However, there are some less popular and client-only multibyte

encodings (such as SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain

valid multibyte characters that end with the byte 0x5c, which is the

representation of the backslash character >>\<< in ASCII. Many client

libraries and applications use the non-standard, but popular way of

escaping the >>'<< character by replacing all occurences of it with

```
>>\'<<. If a client application uses one of the affected encodings and
does not interpret multibyte characters, and an attacker supplies a
specially crafted byte sequence as an input string parameter, this
escaping method would then produce a validly-encoded character and
an excess >>'<< character which would end the string. All subsequent
characters would then be interpreted as SQL code, so the attacker
could execute arbitrary SQL commands.

To fix this vulnerability end-to-end, client-side applications must
be fixed to properly interpret multibyte encodings and use >>''<<
instead of >>\'<<. However, as a precautionary measure, the sequence
>>\'<< is now regarded as invalid when one of the affected client
encodings is in use. If you depend on the previous behaviour, you
can restore it by setting 'backslash_quote = on' in postgresql.conf.
However, please be aware that this could render you vulnerable
again.

This issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like
SQL_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like
UTF-8) encodings.

```

Please see <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/techdocs.50> for further

details.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* postgresql-8.1
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1
* postgresql-client-8.1
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1
* postgresql-contrib-8.1
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1
* libpq4
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1
* libpq-dev
  -
  8.1.4-0ubuntu1

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart all services that

use PostgreSQL to effect the necessary changes. If you can afford it,

rebooting the computer is the easiest way of ensuring that all running

services use the updated client library.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : postgresql
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE IDs        : CVE-2006-2313 CVE-2006-2314

Several encoding problems have been discovered in PostgreSQL, a
popular SQL database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-2313

    Akio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling
    of invalidly-encoded multibyte text data which could allow an
    attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2006-2314

    A similar problem exists in client-side encodings (such as SJIS,
    BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain valid multibyte
    characters that end with the backslash character.  An attacker
    could supply a specially crafted byte sequence that is able to
    inject arbitrary SQL commands.

    This issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like
    SQL_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like
    UTF-8) encodings.

    psycopg and python-pgsql use the old encoding for binary data and
    may have to be updated.

The old stable distribution (woody) is affected by these problems but
we're unable to correct the package.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.7-6sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.13-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

postgresql security update (RHSA-2006-0526)

Original Release Date: June 13, 2006

Last Revised: December 5, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-113

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database system.

PostgreSQL was found to contain a bug in the way it escapes strings in the
PQescapeString function when using multibyte character encoding. An
attacker could construct a specially crafted string with invalidly-encoded
characters which could possibly lead to a SQL injection condition. Both the
PQescapeString function and the PostgreSQL server have been updated to fix
this issue, with the PostgreSQL server fix keeping unpatched clients from
being able to cause this issue. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the names
[CVE-2006-2313](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2313) and
[CVE-2006-2314](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2314).

A bug was found in the password salts generated by PostgreSQL. Because of
this bug, the actual salt size was half of the expected salt size, making
the brute forcing of password hashes easier. The bug was patched so that
all new password hashes have the correct salt length, but not existing ones.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-0591](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0591) to these issues.

Products with an impact of Low only allow PostgreSQL to be accessed locally
on product. Products with an impact of Medium allow PostgreSQL to be
remotely accessed on the product.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0526.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with postgresql installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All version of IALX prior to IALX 2.0 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 or later releases. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All version of MSS prior to MSS 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later releases. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All version of MN prior to MN 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later releases. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Medium | Upgrade to SES 3.1.2 or later releases. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of PostgreSQL, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through
the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya account

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
