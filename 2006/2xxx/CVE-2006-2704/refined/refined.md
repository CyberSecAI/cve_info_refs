Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Secure Elements Class 5 AVR server and client do not enforce encryption for communication. They send and receive messages in cleartext.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of encryption for sensitive data transmission between the server and client components. The server accepts and responds to messages in plaintext.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can eavesdrop on network traffic between the Class 5 AVR server and client, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, such as network assets, vulnerabilities, and remediation history.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack, requiring the attacker to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the server and client.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to monitor network communications between the client and server components of the Secure Elements Class 5 AVR product.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in both the server (VU#135529) and the client (VU#921017) components.
*   The Class 5 AVR client listens on UDP port 60000 and an additional TCP port.
*   The vendor, Secure Elements, addressed the vulnerability in C5 EVM version 2.8.1, by requiring messages to be encrypted using the C5 EVMâ€™s public key, and removing command-line options for unencrypted message text.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the NOAA N-CIRT Lab.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a Severity Metric of 0.66.
*   The CERT advisory indicates that the vulnerability was addressed in C5 EVM version 2.8.1.
* The vulnerability has not been assigned a CVE ID.
