          "Buffer Overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. The specific impact depends on the OS, daemon configuration, and the privileges of the user invoking the daemon:\n\n*   On Unix systems, successful exploitation allows code execution with the privileges of the user that invoked the daemon (except for root, which falls to 'nobody' privileges).\n*   On Windows systems, it allows code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the daemon. If the daemon is installed as a system service, it results in access to system privileges.",
        "attack_vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via the HTTP administrative interface.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the HTTP administrative interface of the vulnerable daemons."
