Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Outgun, as described by Luigi Auriemma:

**A] data\_file\_request command buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The `readString` function does not perform bounds checking when copying data into fixed-size buffers, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Vulnerability:** The server receives a `data_file_request` command along with file type (64 bytes) and file name strings (256 bytes) which are read into fixed-size buffers. The `readString` function copies the attacker-controlled strings into these buffers without checking for their length.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (likely on the server) or a denial-of-service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted `data_file_request` command with overly long file type and/or file name strings to the game server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the game server.

**B] Exception with big data**

*   **Root Cause:** The leetnet library throws an exception if a received data packet exceeds 512 bytes.
*   **Vulnerability:** The leetnet functions handle packets, and if a received data packet exceeds the fixed size of 512 bytes, an exception is thrown, interrupting the game.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, by crashing the game server or client.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted packet larger than 512 bytes.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the game server or client.

**C] Invalid memory access in messages handling**

*   **Root Cause:**  The leetnet message handling functions don't perform adequate checks on message sizes, which can cause out-of-bounds reads.
*    **Vulnerability:** The leetnet library processes up to 64 messages in an incoming packet, but does not check for unallocated memory access after the packet if the attacker provides the wrong message sizes.
*    **Impact:** Information disclosure or denial of service (crashing the server).
*    **Attack Vector:** Sending packets with incorrect message size data to the game server.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the game server.

**D] Harmless buffer-overflow on a global variable in changeRegistration**

*   **Root Cause:** The `changeRegistration` function uses `strcpy` to copy a client's token into a fixed-size buffer without checking the input size.
*   **Vulnerability:** The server's `changeRegistration` function copies the client's token using `strcpy` into a 64-byte buffer. The provided token, which is a string, is not checked for length before copying.
*   **Impact:** Modification of other player's information in the server's memory. (During testing, not capable of crashing the server).
*  **Attack Vector:**  Sending a `changeRegistration` request with an overly long token.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a connected client of the game server.
