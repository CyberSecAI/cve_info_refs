  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2399",
      "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the `readString` function within the `ServerNetworking::incoming_client_data` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `readString` function does not validate the length of the input string before copying it into fixed-size buffers. Specifically, the server uses 64-byte and 256-byte buffers to store file type and file name strings respectively when processing the `data_file_request` command, without any bounds checking during string copy using `readString`."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the server due to buffer overflow.  An attacker can potentially overwrite arbitrary memory locations on the server.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The server receives a `data_file_request` command with overly long strings for the file type and/or name, leading to buffer overflows when the `readString` function copies these strings into fixed-size buffers."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the server. They would need to craft malicious packets containing the `data_file_request` command with oversized strings.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability is found in Outgun versions 1.0.3 and earlier. The `readString` function does not perform length checks leading to the buffer overflow.  Exploiting this vulnerability might allow an attacker to gain control of the server."
    },
     {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2399",
       "root_cause": "Exception due to large data size.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `leetnet` functions used for packet handling throw an exception if data larger than 512 bytes is received."
      ],
      "impact": "Immediate interruption of the game.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Send data packets larger than 512 bytes to cause the server to interrupt the game."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the server."
    },
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2399",
       "root_cause": "Invalid memory access due to lack of checks on message sizes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `leetnet` functions don't perform checks to avoid reading unallocated memory when handling messages with incorrect sizes."
      ],
       "impact": "Potential undefined behavior or crash of the server due to accessing unallocated memory.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Crafting packets with incorrect message sizes to trigger the reading of unallocated memory."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the server."
    },
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2006-2399",
         "root_cause": "Buffer overflow using strcpy in changeRegistration function.",
         "weaknesses": [
            "The `changeRegistration` function uses `strcpy` to copy the client's token into a 64-byte buffer without validating the token length."
        ],
         "impact": "Potentially, allows modification of other players' information. Although, the author was not able to cause a server crash.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Sending a crafted token with a length greater than 64 bytes to the `changeRegistration` function."
        ],
         "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send network packets to the server and change registration information."
