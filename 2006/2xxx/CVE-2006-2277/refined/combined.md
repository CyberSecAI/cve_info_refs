## Description

[![@cary-ilm](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21344665?u=588c7502393a29190a62b7c1038485d1fd0a8df1&v=4&size=48)](/cary-ilm)[cary-ilm](https://github.com/cary-ilm)opened [on Sep 20, 2019](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues/564#issue-496470765)

The test case is available here:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20060520062054/http://w148.de/~cmertes/nachbarhaus1.exr](https://web.archive.org/web/20060520062054/http%3A//w148.de/~cmertes/nachbarhaus1.exr)

This no longer causes a crash, so we conclude that this has been resolved, as of 2.3.0 release at least, possibly earlier.
