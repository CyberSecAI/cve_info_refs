Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `shopcurrency.asp` file within the VP-ASP 6.00 application.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is the `cid` query string parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the `cid` parameter, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate database records, including adding new users with administrative privileges or deleting existing user accounts.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By inserting new users, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative features.
- **Data Breaches:** Depending on the database schema, an attacker might be able to extract sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests, by manipulating the `cid` parameter in the URL.
- Specifically, by injecting SQL code into the `cid` parameter of the `shopcurrency.asp` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable VP-ASP application.
- The attacker must have knowledge of basic SQL syntax to create malicious queries.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The exploit examples provided demonstrate adding a new user 'a' with password 'a' and full access rights (values ('a','a','1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29')).
- It also shows how to delete the newly added user using SQL delete statement.
- The exploit uses the technique of terminating the original SQL query by injecting `';` then adding the malicious SQL commands.
