How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BEAST: Denial of service — GLSA **200704-22**

A vulnerability has been discovered in BEAST allowing for a Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/beast** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.7.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7.1** |

### Background

BEdevilled Audio SysTem is an audio compositor, supporting a wide range
of audio formats.

### Description

BEAST, which is installed as setuid root, fails to properly check
whether it can drop privileges accordingly if seteuid() fails due to a
user exceeding assigned resource limits.

### Impact

A local user could exceed his resource limit in order to prevent the
seteuid() call from succeeding. This may lead BEAST to keep running
with root privileges. Then, the local user could use the "save as"
dialog box to overwrite any file on the vulnerable system, potentially
leading to a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All BEAST users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/beast-0.7.1"
```

The artswrapper program and the artsd daemon can be used to gain root privileges if artswrapper is setuid root and the system is running a 2.6.x kernel.  Note that artswrapper is not setuid root on Slackware by default.  Some people have recommended setting it that way online though, so it's at least worth warning about. It's far safer to just add users to the audio group.  The official KDE security advisory may be found here:   http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20060614-2.txt  More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2916   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/arts-1.4.2-i486-2_slack10.2.tgz:   Patched to fix a possible exploit if artswrapper is setuid root (which,   by default, it is not) and the system is running a 2.6 kernel.   Systems running 2.4 kernels are not affected.   The official KDE security advisory may be found here:     http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20060614-2.txt   The CVE entry for this issue may be found here:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2916   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

# aRts: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200606-22**

The artswrapper part of aRts allows local users to execute arbitrary code
with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/arts** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.2-r1**revision >= **3.4.3-r1** |

### Background

aRts is a real time modular system for synthesizing audio used by KDE.
artswrapper is a helper application used to start the aRts daemon.

### Description

artswrapper fails to properly check whether it can drop privileges
accordingly if setuid() fails due to a user exceeding assigned resource
limits.

### Impact

Local attackers could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges. Note that the aRts package provided by
Gentoo is only vulnerable if the artswrappersuid USE-flag is enabled.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All aRts users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose kde-base/arts
```

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
aRts Security Advisory: artswrapper setuid() return value checking vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2006-06-14
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20060614-2.txt
0. References
CVE-2006-2916
1. Systems affected:
artswrapper, part of aRts, if installed SUID root and running under
Linux 2.6.0 or newer.
2. Overview:
artswrapper is a helper application to start the aRts daemon
with realtime privileges even for normal users. The wrapper
assumes that setuid() can not fail for SUID root applications.
This assertion is wrong under Linux kernel 2.6.0 or newer.
Successful exploitation allows a normal user to launch artsd
as root, which could be exploited to gain system privileges.
3. Impact:
Normal users can become root.
4. Solution:
Source code patches have been made available which fix these
vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
A quick workaround is to remove the suid bit from the
artswrapper binary.
5. Patch:
A patch for aRts 1.2.0 and newer is available from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security\_patches :
64fcd7bf31d8b0ade22b8f98fbebe0fb arts-1.2.x.diff
A patch for aRts 1.0.0 and newer is available from
