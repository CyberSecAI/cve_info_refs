The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in PunBB version 1.2.11 and lower.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the "Admin note" feature in PunBB. This feature allows administrators to keep notes about users. These notes are not sanitized and are displayed as HTML code (or JScript) on user pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Arbitrary HTML and JScript can be injected via the admin note feature

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin notes. This script will be executed when an administrator views the user's profile or the list of users based on an IP, allowing the attacker to potentially perform actions as the administrator, steal cookies or redirect them to another website. 

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when an admin views a user's profile or a list of users based on a certain IP and the admin note contains malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges in order to input the malicious script into the admin note field.
