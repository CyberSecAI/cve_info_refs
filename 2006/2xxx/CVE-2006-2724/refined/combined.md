[N]eo [S]ecurity [T]eam [NST]® Advisory #22
---------------------------------------------------------------
Program : PunBB 1.2.11
Homepage: <http://www.punbb.org>
Vulnerable Versions: PunBB 1.2.11 & lower ones
Risk: Low!
Impact: Indirect cross site scripting

-> PunBB 1.2.11 Cross site scripting <-
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Description
---------------------------------------------------------------
In short, PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP powered discussion board.
It is released under the GNU Public License. Its primary goal is to be
a faster, smaller and less graphic alternative to otherwise excellent
discussion boards such as phpBB, Invision Power Board or vBulletin.
PunBB has fewer features than many other discussion boards, but is
generally faster and outputs smaller pages.

- Tested
---------------------------------------------------------------
Tested in localhost & many forums

- Bug
---------------------------------------------------------------
In this case the XSS it is taken as a low risk bug because of its
circumstances.

An admin in PunBB can use a feature called `Admin note' to keep some
notes about a certain user. The problem is that this note it is not
sanitized.

As you can see, an attack could only been executed if the admin writes
a malicius script, wich is stupid.
This note it is seen on every post of the user, but here its filtered,
the problem lies when the admin look to all users who have a certain IP.
f.e: The admin wants to know all users that have the IP-> 2.0.0.6
The output will be:

Username  E-mail  Title/Status  Posts  Admin note  Actions
baduser   b@b.b   New member     500   [blank]      .....

So, there the admin note its executed as HTML code (JScript) or whatever.

- Exploit
---------------------------------------------------------------
NST will not release any code to exploit this bug.

- Solutions
---------------------------------------------------------------
A new version of PunBB it is available, it is recommended to update it.

WinLegends is home to over 4,000 casino games, too, ensuring that there is likely to be something you’ll want to play after signing up there today. Don’t worry if you need more details, though, as we’ll explain all right here.

## How Secure Is WinLegends Casino?

Security is one of the most important aspects of any casino site. WinLegends has taken precautions to ensure that it is licensed (out of Curacao), and that it is affiliated with problem gambling programs. It could do with a few more responsible gambling tools than the self-exclusion options it provides, but they are still much appreciated. Its games are RNG-certified and provide reasonable RTP rates, so that’s another perk.

## WinLegends Casino Bonuses

WinLegends Casino is a strange casino site when it comes to its welcome bonuses. There are three different types to claim, and each is a package of three bonuses. Therefore, while there are nine offers, you can only claim three of them. Confused? Don’t be. Here’s how it works:

The first offer is the Lara Bonus, based on Tomb Raider’s central star, Lara Croft. It is worth a 225% match up to $2,000 overall, consisting of 100%, 50% and 75% bonuses up to $500, $1,000 and $500 on your first, second and third deposits, respectively. Expect wagering requirements of 40x and a minimum deposit limit of $20.

If the cash match isn’t for you, you can always opt for the Ben Bonus. This is worth 450 free spins on Pragmatic Play slots. Here, you’ll receive 200 free spins on Sugar Rush, 100 spins on The Dog House and 150 spins on Big Bass Splash on your respective deposits. Expect 25x rollover rates here and minimum deposit limits of $25.

The final option is themed on Indiana Jones. The Indy Bonus offers cash and free spins each step of the way for a bonus worth 180% up to $2,000 and 180 free spins in all. Claim matches of 80%, 40% and 60% up to $600, $1,000 and $500 on your first, second and third deposits, respectively. Moreover, you’ll get 60 Gates of Olympus spins, 60 free games on The Hand of Midas, and 60 free shots on Fire in the Hole xBomb, respectively. This time, the wagering requirement is 25x, and the minimum deposit limit is $25.

All the bonuses are valid for a total of ten days from the moment you claim them, and any bets with bonus funds are limited to $5 a pop. Next, we’ll touch on the other promos and bonuses at WinLegends. However, we should note that the Top Packages (displayed below) are correct at the time of writing but may be subject to change – specifically, the slot any free spins are valid on. Even so, here’s what you need to know:

| **Top Packages No. 1** | Claim a handy 30% bonus up to $3,000 while benefiting from 60 free spins on the Release the Kraken slot. |
| --- | --- |
| **Top Packages No. 2** | Claim a clever 30% bonus up to $3,000 and snap up 60 free spins on the Shadow Treasure slot. |
| **Top Packages No. 3** | Grab a 30% bonus up to $3,000 and sixty free games on Boat Bonanza Christmas. |
| **Enjoy Bonus** | Claim 15% on every deposit you make, worth up to $500. |
| **Wednesday Bonus** | Make a deposit on Wednesdays to claim a 50% deal up to $500 and 60 free spins on selected slots. |
| **Weekend Reload** | Deposit to claim $500 in bonus funds via a 60% match and benefit from another sixty free spins. |

## Tournaments

Tournaments are available at WinLegends Casino, even if the casino isn’t home to the most extensive array of them. The site’s main tournaments include a monthly Pragmatic Play tourney worth a prize pool of $30,000 and monthly Play’n Go offerings worth $10,000. Of course, you can also play networked tournaments, such as Pragmatic Play’s Drops & Wins, which has a top prize worth $4 million a quarter.

## Loyalty Program

If you fancy being rewarded for your efforts, WinLegends is only too happy to oblige. Here, the online casino can see you benefit from a loyalty shop. You’ll earn Diamonds by playing games and completing achievements in your time at the site. Those Diamonds can then be spent on free spins, cash bonuses and other goodies at the online casino.

That’s not all, though. You’ll also pick up loyalty points as a player at WinLegends. These can be used to navigate its VIP scheme to benefit from perks that include increasing levels of cashback, increased withdrawal limits (which is good because they are quite low to start off with), WinCards, level bonuses, personal account managers and other goodies. Here’s a brief look at how the levels work and what you can expect to receive:

| **VIP Level** | **Benefits** |
| --- | --- |
| VIP Level 1: Seeker | 10% Cashback, Level Bonus, WinCards, and monthly withdrawal limits of $2,000 |
| VIP Level 2: Collector | 12% Cashback, Level Bonus, WinCards, and monthly withdrawal limits of $5,000 |
| VIP Level 3: Antique Dealer | 15% Cashback, Level Bonus, WinCards, a personal account manager, and monthly withdrawal limits of $50,000 |
| VIP Level 4: Tomb Raider | 20% Cashback, Level Bonus, WinCards, a personal account manager, and monthly withdrawal limits of $200,000 |
| VIP Level 5: Treasure Hunter | 25% Cashback, Level Bonus, WinCards, a personal account manager, and monthly withdrawal limits of $500,000 |

As you can see, WinLegends makes it possible for you to snap up as much as $500 in cashback, courtesy of the highest rate of 25%. The minimum amount you can receive at WinLegends is just ten bucks. All cashback is tied to bet limits of $5 and comes with 20x wagering requirements. You’ll also note that cashback is valid for just ten days.

## Table Games Collection

WinLegends Casino supports live casino games from the likes of Evolution, Asia Gaming, Ezugi, Vivo Gaming, Pragmatic Play Live, and Playtech, amongst others. You’ll find an even larger selection of developers involved in the RNG table games library.

Around 200 or so live tables can be expected, some of which can be played in several languages. This ensures that there are various table limits for you to enjoy when betting. Amongst the more popular titles are casino classics such as Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, Sic Bo, Keno, Poker, Dragon Tiger, Andar Bahar, and Craps. Of course, if you like oddities, then wheel-based games, crash games, and wall-based game shows will also be worth a look.

## Slots Collection

With so many free spins available at this casino, it is only understandable to expect that the slots library would be the biggest. It is home to over 95% of this casino’s game collection. From the lobby, you’ll be able to navigate this giant collection with ease, making use of filters that include Slots, Tournaments, Popular, New, Bonus Games, Hot, and Jackpot options.

Speaking of collections, there is a drop-down menu that gives you additional options to filter games. These include choosing games that have been deemed to fit into High Volatility, Win Multiplier, Pick Bonus, and Megaways genres.

Searching for games based on their software providers is also an option. This menu lets you look for games from 1x2 Games, BetSoft Gaming, BGaming, Big Time Gaming, ELK Studios, Endorphina, Evolution, NetEnt, No Limit City, Novomatic, Play’n Go, Playtech, Pragmatic Play, Quickspin, Red Tiger, Spinomenal, Stakelogic, Thunderkick, and Yggdrasil, amongst others. You can also take our advice if you want a helping hand getting started. The following RNG-certified, mobile-optimised slot games come highly recommended by our experts and are widely available at WinLegends:

* **Pragmatic Play:** Sweet Bonanza, Gates of Olympus, Big Bass Bonanza, Madame Destiny, The Dog House
* **Big Time Gaming:** Bonanza, Danger: High Voltage, White Rabbit: Megaways, Who Wants to be A Millionaire Megaways, Rasputin
* **Playtech:** Absolutely Mammoth, Anaconda Uncoiled, Vikings: Empire Treasures, Pyramid Valley: Power Zones, Anaconda Wild II
* **Play’n Go:** Rich Wilde and the Book of Dead, Baron Samedi, Legacy of Dead, Fire Joker, Reactoonz

## Deposits & Withdrawals

WinLegends Casino accepts quite a handful of currencies, including AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CLP, EUR, HUF, NOK, NZD, PLN, and USD options. These can all be used to deposit, withdraw, claim bonuses, and play games. While cryptocurrencies are accepted at WinLegends, they are only offered as deposit and withdrawal methods. You cannot claim bonuses or place bets within crypto stakes. Instead, they are converted into a FIAT option for those purposes.

### Deposit & Withdrawal Limits

If you’re thinking of topping up your account, you’ll need to make a deposit worth at least $20. There is a maximum deposit limit at WinLegends of $5,000 to $10,000 in many cases, although this is tied to the payment methods that are available, and it isn’t put in place by the casino.

You’ll also find limits associated with withdrawals at the casino. Typically, minimum withdrawal limits range from $10 up to $25 at the casino. As for the upper limits, these are quite low at just $2,000. However, it is important to note that those caps are in place for anybody who hasn’t reached at least tier one of the VIP schemes. As soon as they do so, those limits will rise, with the maximum monthly withdrawal limit capped at $500,000.

Transactions are generally fast at this site. WinLegends Casino can process all deposits instantly, irrespective of the payment method you use. For withdrawals, you can expect the usual time frames of three to five days for bank transfers, rising to 1-3 days for card transactions. Cryptocurrency and e-wallet options are the fastest, with WinLegends readily able to process your withdrawal in under 24 hours in most cases. In fact, crypto transactions can often take place in just a few hours, sometimes under an hour.

There is a KYC process at WinLegends, and if you’re requested to go through it (which is more likely the higher the sum you try to withdraw), then expect delays to your withdrawals until the process is complete.

### Payment Options

A plethora of payment methods are available at WinLegends Casino, and the site aims to cater to almost everyone. Your customary FIAT options include methods such as [Apple Pay](https://www.nodepositcasinobonus.org/apple-pay/), AstroPay Card, CashtoCode, eZeeWallet, Google Pay, Interac, MasterCard, MiFinity, Neosurf, Paysafecard, Neosurf, Neteller, Rapid Transfer, Skrill, and VISA. If you prefer cryptocurrencies (and these options aren’t open to everyone), then you will feel at home using Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tether, or Tron.

## Customer Support

There isn’t much to say about the customer support methods at WinLegends Casino. As with any trustworthy and reputable casino, it can support customer support options that include 24/7 live chat and e-mail assistance ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)). There is an FAQ, too, and it can also help if you have a simpler question or query.

## Conclusion

WinLegends stands out. It has one of the strangest but ultimately beneficial welcome bonuses. Those packages are joined by a regular array of deals for existing members that span free spins and cash matches. You’ve also got 4,000+ games, decent payment options, and high cashout limits. In short, there’s plenty to like about joining WinLegends Casino as a new player today.
