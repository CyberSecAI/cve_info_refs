Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-2130:

**Summary:**

The provided content from evuln.com directly addresses CVE-2006-2130 and CVE-2006-2131, detailing two vulnerabilities in the Advanced Poll script. This analysis focuses on the  **Unauthorized Data Modification** vulnerability which is associated with **CVE-2006-2130**. The other vulnerability, SQL Injection, is associated with CVE-2006-2131.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the application's use of the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header to identify unique voters without proper validation.
*   **Weakness:** The application trusts the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header value, which is easily manipulated by attackers, leading to the ability to spoof votes.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject arbitrary IP addresses into the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header when answering a poll question.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with custom headers. The attacker does not need any special privileges other than access to the poll functionality.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Attackers can skew poll results by casting multiple votes, appearing as different users from different IP addresses. The vulnerability allows for the manipulation of voting data.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Script:** `include/class_poll.php`
*   The script uses the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header's value to identify unique voters which allows a malicious user to provide any arbitrary IP address in order to cast multiple votes
