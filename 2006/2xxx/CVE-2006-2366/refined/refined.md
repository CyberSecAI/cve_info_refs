- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ircp -r` command in `openobex-apps` uses the filename provided by the remote source when receiving a file via OBEX protocol, without checking if a file with the same name already exists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a file overwrite issue.  The application does not check for existing files before writing to a new file path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in physical proximity can potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the victim's system by sending files with the desired filenames.  For example, an attacker could overwrite crucial configuration files such as `.bashrc`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical proximity using the OBEX protocol (typically Bluetooth).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the OBEX connection (e.g., Bluetooth) and must be able to initiate a file transfer to the victim's device.
