Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla
which are also present in Mozilla Thunderbird.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2006-1942

    Eric Foley discovered that a user can be tricked to expose a local
    file to a remote attacker by displaying a local file as image in
    connection with other vulnerabilities.  [MFSA-2006-39]

CVE-2006-2775

    XUL attributes are associated with the wrong URL under certain
    circumstances, which might allow remote attackers to bypass
    restrictions.  [MFSA-2006-35]

CVE-2006-2776

    Paul Nickerson discovered that content-defined setters on an
    object prototype were getting called by privileged user interface
    code, and "moz_bug_r_a4" demonstrated that the higher privilege
    level could be passed along to the content-defined attack code.
    [MFSA-2006-37]

CVE-2006-2777

    A vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
    and create notifications that are executed in a privileged
    context.  [MFSA-2006-43]

CVE-2006-2778

    Mikolaj Habryn a buffer overflow in the crypto.signText function
    that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain
    optional Certificate Authority name arguments.  [MFSA-2006-38]

CVE-2006-2779

    Mozilla team members discovered several crashes during testing of
    the browser engine showing evidence of memory corruption which may
    also lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  This problem has
    only partially been corrected.  [MFSA-2006-32]

CVE-2006-2780

    An integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service and may permit the execution of arbitrary code.
    [MFSA-2006-32]

CVE-2006-2781

    Masatoshi Kimura discovered a double-free vulnerability that
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
    execute arbitrary code via a VCard.  [MFSA-2006-40]

CVE-2006-2782

    Chuck McAuley discovered that a text input box can be pre-filled
    with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,
    allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name
    they can guess.  [MFSA-2006-41, MFSA-2006-23, CVE-2006-1729]

CVE-2006-2783

    Masatoshi Kimura discovered that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM)
    is stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode
    before the parser sees the web page, which allows remote attackers
    to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  [MFSA-2006-42]

CVE-2006-2784

    Paul Nickerson discovered that the fix for CAN-2005-0752 can be
    bypassed using nested javascript: URLs, allowing the attacker to
    execute privileged code.  [MFSA-2005-34, MFSA-2006-36]

CVE-2006-2785

    Paul Nickerson demonstrated that if an attacker could convince a
    user to right-click on a broken image and choose "View Image" from
    the context menu then he could get JavaScript to
    run.  [MFSA-2006-34]

CVE-2006-2786

    Kazuho Oku discovered that Mozilla's lenient handling of HTTP
    header syntax may allow remote attackers to trick the browser to
    interpret certain responses as if they were responses from two
    different sites.  [MFSA-2006-33]

CVE-2006-2787

    The Mozilla researcher "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that JavaScript
    run via EvalInSandbox can escape the sandbox and gain elevated
    privilege.  [MFSA-2006-31]

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.8a.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0.4-1 and xulrunner 1.5.0.4-1 for galeon and epiphany.

We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla Thunderbird packages.

It seems like it would be better not to touch mFirst in Reset(). The current semantics of Reset are that it resets all the per-character state. I'd rather leave it that way and set mFirst in the constructor and where you do now, and leave the call to Reset.

I'm having trouble parsing the comment. Is this just an optimization? Optimizing for what?

Also, I think Reset is used by the callers to handle encoding errors (advance and continue decoding), and I don't think you want it to reset mFirst.

[variant, splitting the word script](attachment.cgi?id=220213)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=220213&action=edit)

Should anyone doubt it, the zero-width character can split the word script, too. The displayed output on IE and Opera differ a bit between the two cases.
<&#65279;script>alert('hello'); // in the original
alert('hello'); // in this one.

Hm... a comment in nsIDecoder.h is now out of date?

Yes. Please correct my poor English.
> Optimizing for what?
Uconv is performance critical. This will be used all UTF-8 web page. I do not want to test mFirst with each ASCII character.

I'd make the comment say:
Set mFirst to PR\_FALSE now so we don't have to every time through the ASCII branch within the loop
Have you looked to see if there are callers of Reset doing what's originally documented? It's probably much less risky the way you wrote it, actually, so we should probably leave the Reset behavior as you suggested.

I didn't seek callers, but the UTF16 decoder also resets the state regarding the BOM.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security bugs in the mozilla
package are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Seamonkey is an open source Web browser, advanced email and newsgroup
client, IRC chat client, and HTML editor.

The Mozilla Foundation has discontinued support for the Mozilla Suite. This
update deprecates the Mozilla Suite in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 in
favor of the supported Seamonkey Suite.

This update also resolves a number of outstanding Mozilla security issues:

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-2776,
CVE-2006-2784, CVE-2006-2785, CVE-2006-2787, CVE-2006-3807, CVE-2006-3809,
CVE-2006-3812)

Several denial of service flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain web content. A malicious web page could crash the browser or
possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Seamonkey.
(CVE-2006-2779, CVE-2006-2780, CVE-2006-3801, CVE-2006-3677, CVE-2006-3113,
CVE-2006-3803, CVE-2006-3805, CVE-2006-3806, CVE-2006-3811)

Two flaws were found in the way Seamonkey-mail displayed malformed
inline vcard attachments. If a victim viewed an email message containing
a carefully crafted vcard it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the
user running Mozilla-mail. (CVE-2006-2781, CVE-2006-3804)

A cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed
Unicode Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web
page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer
could miss due to a malformed "script" tag. (CVE-2006-2783)

Several flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed certain javascript
actions. A malicious web page could conduct a cross-site scripting attack
or steal sensitive information (such as cookies owned by other domains).
(CVE-2006-3802, CVE-2006-3810)

A form file upload flaw was found in the way Seamonkey handled javascript
input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local
file at form submission time without user interaction. (CVE-2006-2782)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Seamonkey called the
crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the
browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded. (CVE-2006-2778)

Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Seamonkey processed
certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return
specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy
restrictions. (CVE-2006-2786)

A flaw was found in the way Seamonkey processed Proxy AutoConfig scripts. A
malicious Proxy AutoConfig server could execute arbitrary javascript
instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal
sensitive information or install browser malware. (CVE-2006-3808)

A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method was
called. If a victim visited a carefully crafted web page, it was possible
to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. (CVE-2006-2788)

Users of Mozilla are advised to upgrade to this update, which contains
Seamonkey version 1.0.3 that corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

Multilib systems may experience difficulty if trying to specify the package
by name to the Update Agent via a command line argument. This can be
solved by executing the following commands:

up2date seamonkey; up2date seamonkey-nss seamonkey-nspr

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=196969#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-27 21:13:45 UTC  ``` [CVE-2006-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2777) MFSA 2006-43 [CVE-2006-2776](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2776) MFSA 2006-37 [CVE-2006-2784](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2784) MFSA 2006-36 [CVE-2006-2785](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2785) MFSA 2006-34 [CVE-2006-2787](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2787) MFSA 2006-31 Several flaws were found in the way Mozilla processes certain javascript actions. A malicious web page could execute arbitrary javascript instructions with the permissions of "chrome", allowing the page to steal sensitive information or install browser malware.  [CVE-2006-2783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2783) MFSA 2006-42 A cross site scripting flaw was found in the way Mozilla processes Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) markers in UTF-8 web pages. A malicious web page could execute a script within the browser that a web input sanitizer could miss due to a malformed "script" tag.  [CVE-2006-2782](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2782) MFSA 2006-41 A form file upload flaw was found in the way Mozilla handles javascript input object mutation. A malicious web page could upload an arbitrary local file at form submission time without user interaction.  [CVE-2006-2778](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2778) MFSA 2006-38 A denial of service flaw was found in the way Mozilla calls the crypto.signText() javascript function. A malicious web page could crash the browser if the victim had a client certificate loaded.  These issues will remain unfixed in Mozilla until Seamonkey is released.  They are not additional issues, simply problems which are fixed as part of the upgrade.   [CVE-2006-2786](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2786) MFSA 2006-33 Two HTTP response smuggling flaws were found in the way Mozilla processes certain invalid HTTP response headers. A malicious web site could return specially crafted HTTP response headers which may bypass HTTP proxy restrictions.  [CVE-2006-2788](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2788) A double free flaw was found in the way the nsIX509::getRawDER method is called. If a victim visits a carefully crafted web page it is possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Mozilla. ([CVE-2006-2788](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2788))   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=196969#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-06-27 21:16:11 UTC  ``` These issues will remain unfixed in Mozilla until Seamonkey is released.  They are not additional issues, simply problems which are fixed as part of the upgrade.   That statement ended up in the middle of the above block due to my inability to understand how scrollbars work.  It should be at the top to describe this bug.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=196969#c2)  Xiaohong Wang    2006-07-07 02:36:29 UTC  ``` We're relying on upstream for verification because we have no test code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=196969#c4)  Josh Bressers    2006-07-14 19:59:44 UTC  ``` [CVE-2006-2777](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-2777) is being tracked via [bug 198934](show_bug.cgi?id=198934 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2006-2777 Seamonkey Privilege escalation using addSelectionListener")   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=196969#c5)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-02 18:31:09 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0609.html>    ``` |  |

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200606-12**

Vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow privilege escalations for
JavaScript code, cross site scripting attacks, HTTP response smuggling and
possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.4** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.4** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

A number of vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Firefox. For details please consult the references below.

### Impact

By enticing the user to visit a malicious website, a remote
attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript Code into the user's
browser, execute JavaScript code with elevated privileges and possibly
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.4"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.4"
```

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the Alpha
architecture yet. Users of Mozilla Firefox on Alpha should consider
unmerging it until such a version is available.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-42

## Web site XSS using BOM on UTF-8 pages

Announced
June 1, 2006
Reporter
Masatoshi Kimura
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.4
* SeaMonkey 1.0.2
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.4

### Description

Masatoshi Kimura reports that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) is
stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode before
the parser sees the web page. As a result the parser will see and
process `script` tags that web input sanitizers may miss
because they appear as "scr[BOM]ipt" or similar in the comment code
on the web site.

Although Firefox 1.5.0.4 and later will be fixed and no longer
accept such script tags, web sites will continue to be visited by
older versions of Firefox and Mozilla browsers. Web sites can protect
themselves by explicitly setting the character encoding to something other
than UTF-8, or by adding the Unicode byte-order marks to the repertoire
of the site's input sanitizer.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Users can protect themselves by disabling JavaScript on sites that allow
community input until they can upgrade to a fixed version.

Sites can protect their users by stripping the BOM from web input
or, if appropriate, specifying a character encoding other than UTF-8.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200606-21**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Thunderbird allow cross site scripting,
JavaScript privilege escalation and possibly execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.4** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.4** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is the next-generation mail client from the Mozilla
project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Thunderbird.
For details, please consult the references below.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious emails that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with elevated
privileges, spoof content, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.4"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.4"
```

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the Alpha architecture yet.
Users of Mozilla Thunderbird on Alpha should consider unmerging it
until such a version is available.
