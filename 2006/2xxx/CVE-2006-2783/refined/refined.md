  "CVE-2006-2783": {
    "description": "Masatoshi Kimura discovered that the Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) is stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode before the parser sees the web page, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Mozilla Firefox < 1.5.0.4",
      "SeaMonkey < 1.0.2",
      "Thunderbird < 1.5.0.4"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Unicode Byte-order-Mark (BOM) is stripped from UTF-8 pages during the conversion to Unicode before the parser sees the web page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The browser does not handle BOM correctly, stripping it before parsing the web page."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing a malformed script tag, with BOM to bypass filters, leading to script execution."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to craft a malicious UTF-8 web page containing specially crafted script tags."
    ],
     "notes": "This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters in UTF-8 pages, allowing attackers to bypass input sanitizers and inject malicious scripts into a website."
