{
  "CVE-2006-2668": {
    "Description": "The DoceboLms 2.0.5 application is vulnerable to remote file inclusion via the 'lang' parameter in several files, including `business.php`, `credits.php`, and `help.php`. This allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary files and potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The application uses the value of the 'lang' GET parameter to include a language file without proper validation or sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can include arbitrary files from a remote server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This could result in complete compromise of the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable scripts with the 'lang' parameter set to a malicious URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and must have access to a web server to host the malicious code. No authentication is required."
