### FAQs

[What is antivirus software?](#collapse-88635)
Antivirus software is a type of software designed to detect, prevent, and remove dangerous software or malware from your computer — including viruses, trojans, ransomware, adware, spyware, and more. It starts by scanning a computer’s files, programs, and disks for any hidden malware or other sophisticated threats. If threats are detected, antivirus software can quarantine infected files to prevent them from taking over your whole device.

It’s essential to have antivirus software installed on your computer because it adds a layer of [cybersecurity protection](/c-b-what-is-cybersecurity) and strengthens your online privacy and security. [Choosing the right antivirus software](https://blog.avast.com/which-type-of-antivirus-should-you-choose) can help can prevent threats that could cause data loss, system corruption, financial loss, [identity theft](/c-identity-theft), and privacy breaches.

[Is there a 100% free antivirus?](#collapse-85128)
Yes, there are various free antivirus software, although not all of them will provide you with full protection. Avast Free Antivirus is completely free and offers all the security you need.

[How do I detect and remove viruses and other malware?](#collapse-69715)
Avast’s free antivirus software detects and blocks all [types of malware](/c-malware) in real time to prevent them from infecting your computer. At the same time, it scans your PC to [remove viruses and other malware](/c-virus-removal-tool) automatically before they can do real damage.

[Is free virus protection enough protection?](#collapse-67298)
The basic level of virus protection, like Windows Defender (Windows built-in security), may not offer the same comprehensive features, updates, and support as advanced antivirus software.

Technology is always changing which means cybercriminals can develop new tactics. Windows Defender can serve as basic protection for your computer but may not be enough to protect you from new emerging threats. It's important to consider a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity for optimal protection in the long run and you can start by trying out a free virus protection software, like **Avast Free Antivirus.**

[What does antivirus software do?](#collapse-26057)
Trusted by hundreds of millions of users around the world, Avast uses advanced machine learning techniques to [protect against ransomware attacks](/c-ransomware-protection-tool) and other emerging threats. Avast Free Antivirus software detects, blocks, and removes all types of malware: viruses, adware, [spyware](/c-spyware), [Trojans](/c-trojan), and more. You’ll also get security for your Wi-Fi network and real-time defense against [phishing attacks](/c-phishing), unsafe websites, and other threats to your devices.

[Why is Avast one of the best free antivirus solutions?](#collapse-8404)
Avast’s free antivirus software combines cutting-edge, AI-driven cybersecurity with a massive threat-detection network of over 435 million users that lets us protect our entire community in real time against online threats whenever they appear.

Our industry-leading antivirus engine is just one of the many reasons why Avast Free Antivirus consistently earns high praise and top awards from PCMag, AV-Comparatives, AV-Test, and other independent experts. We have one of the [best antivirus software solutions](/c-best-free-antivirus-software) available, because we have the right antivirus protection for all your needs.

In 2021, Avast released a new and enhanced product called [Avast One](https://www.avast.com/avast-one), which is now available in the [United States](https://www.avast.com/en-us/avast-one), [United Kingdom](https://www.avast.com/en-gb/avast-one), [Canada](https://www.avast.com/en-ca/avast-one), [Australia](https://www.avast.com/en-au/avast-one), [Switzerland](https://www.avast.com/fr-ch/avast-one), [France](https://www.avast.com/fr-fr/avast-one), and [Germany](https://www.avast.com/de-de/avast-one).

[Why is Avast Free Antivirus even better than Windows Defender?](#collapse-5685)
Now known as Microsoft Defender, [Windows Defender isn’t enough](/c-is-windows-defender-enough) to match leading third-party PC antivirus programs. While it’ll keep your computer relatively safe against most types of malware, its anti-phishing protection is limited to Microsoft Edge — so you’ll need Avast Free Antivirus to protect you on other browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Microsoft Defender also doesn’t score quite as highly with independent testing labs like AV-Comparatives. For comprehensive threat protection on your PC, go with Avast — the world’s most trusted antivirus.

[How long can I use Avast Free Antivirus on my device?](#collapse-40894)
You can use our free antivirus for as long as you want once you activate it. After 12 months, our app might prompt you to reactivate your free subscription so that you can keeping using it. If you decide to change device, you’ll need to download our free antivirus app again on that specific Windows PC.
