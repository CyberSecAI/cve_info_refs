```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by an insecure inclusion of a file specified through the 'includePath' parameter. This allows an attacker to include a remote file with malicious PHP code.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application allows the inclusion of a remote file via the 'includePath' parameter, which can be manipulated by an attacker to point to a malicious PHP script.
- Insecure parameter handling: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the 'includePath' parameter, allowing for arbitrary URLs to be used.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP request: The attacker crafts an HTTP GET request containing the vulnerable path and sets the 'includePath' and 'cmd' cookies to their desired values. The 'includePath' cookie points to a malicious PHP file hosted on a server controlled by the attacker. The 'cmd' cookie contains the command to execute on the target system.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the target server to send the malicious HTTP requests.
- Hosting for malicious code: The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious PHP file.
- `register_globals=On` and `allow_url_fopen=On` must be enabled on the target system

More detail than the CVE description:
The provided exploit code gives details of the attack, including the specific vulnerable files (mambo.inc.php, postnuke.inc.php) and the cookie parameters required to trigger the vulnerability (includePath and cmd). It also includes a sample malicious PHP file and explains the required server configurations (register_globals=On, allow_url_fopen=On) for a successful exploit.
