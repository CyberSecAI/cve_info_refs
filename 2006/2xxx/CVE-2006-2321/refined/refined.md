        "File Reading: Direct use of user-supplied input in `OpenTextFile` leading to arbitrary file reading.",

      "attack_vectors": [
        "File Reading: Manipulation of file path parameters.",
        "File Uploading: Uploading files with malicious content and a specific extension or by using a null byte injection.",
