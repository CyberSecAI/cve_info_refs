{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Secure Elements Class 5 AVR client does not validate the CEID (Component Endpoint Identifier) of incoming messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of message target identifier."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker does not need to guess the true CEID of a victim asset to send commands to it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network communication over UDP port 60000 and an additional TCP port.",
       "Sending commands to the Class 5 AVR client without proper CEID validation."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the Class 5 AVR client on the network.",
    "additional_information": "The Class 5 AVR client listens on UDP port 60000 and an additional TCP port and receives commands from the Class 5 AVR server. This vulnerability exists because the client does not validate the CEID of messages it receives. The fix is available in C5 EVM version 2.8.1 and above where the client now validates that the CEID of the incoming message matches its own CEID. The product is now called C5 EVM (Enterprise Vulnerability Management)"
