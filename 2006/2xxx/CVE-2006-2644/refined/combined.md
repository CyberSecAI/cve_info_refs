How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1075-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
May 26th, 2006                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : awstats
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 365910

Hendrik Weimer discovered that awstats can execute arbitrary commands
under the user id the web-server runs when users are allowed to supply
arbitrary configuration files.  Even though, this bug was referenced
in DSA 1058 accidently, it was not fixed yet.

The new default behaviour is not ao accept arbitrary configuration
directories from the user.  This can be overwritten by the
AWSTATS_ENABLE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable when users are to be
trusted.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your awstats package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Other people typically interested in web analytics are web hosters both as a service for customers and an early-warning system in case of trouble. A graphical log file analyzer like AWStats transforms the rather dull log file content into a more comprehensible representation.  AWStats aims to satisfy both user groups. The Perl script can be run from the command line to produce static HTML pages or run as a CGI application. Although AWStats can also manage log files for mail, FTP and other servers, it is most suitable for web servers.  Configuration is done via a config file in which the location of the log file and the domain name(s) have to be specified. AWStats has no problems with multiple virtual hosts even when their traffic is logged to the same file. Typically, the statistics are updated by a cronjob, however triggering updates via the web interface can also be enabled.   | [Monthly summary](/images/articles/awstats_1.png) | | --- | | Monthly summary(click to enlarge) |   AWStats presents its data grouped by months. Visitors, number of visits, pages, hits and bandwidth are shown for the days of the month, the days of week and the hours. Average and totals are available as well. Bar charts give a direct visual impression of the data.  In the next tables, the visitors' IP addresses (optionally grouped by country using [geolocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation)), operating systems and browsers are given. The probably most important statistics, the most popular URLs and referrers is also found there, followed by the most frequent search queries and keywords. In the main window, only the first few places are shown, but the complete data is available, too. Based on the time between a visitor's first and last document access AWStats tries to calculate an average visit duration.  While the amount of different statistics is quite impressive, the filtering options are not very helpful. The only available time spans are a month or a year, so asking how many people have downloaded PDF files from a certain directory during the last week is impossible.  You can add additional statistics by defining extensions in the config file. Using regular expressions you can filter URLs, referrers, virtual hosts and other parameters. For example, this allows you to track product orders in an online shop.  AWStats received attention last year when the [Lupper worm](http://antivirus.about.com/od/virusdescriptions/a/linuxlupper.htm) used an AWStats vulnerability to infect web servers around the net. To see how the developers reacted, OS Reviews took a quick look at the code. As a result, the following new vulnerabilities have been discovered:   * If the update of the stats via web front-end is allowed, a   remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server using a   specially crafted request involving the migrate   parameter. Input starting with a pipe character ("|") leads to   an insecure call to Perl's open function and the rest of the   input being executed in a shell. The code is run in the context of   the process running the AWStats CGI. * Arbitrary code can be executed by uploading a specially   crafted configuration file if an attacker can put a file on the   server with chosen file name and content (e.g. by using an FTP   account on a shared hosting server). In this configuration file,   the LogFile directive can be used to execute shell code   following a pipe character. As above, an open call on   unsanitized input is the source of this vulnerability. * Furthermore, the cross-site scripting vulnerability described   in   [CVE-2006-1945](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2006-1945)   also exists with the diricons parameter and possibly others   as well.   Particularly notable about these holes is that they are very similar to previously discovered ones. The problems with calls to the  open function were already known before. Additionally, the developers claim that [only one vulnerability](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/awstats_security_news.php) has been found in the history of AWStats, which is simply [not true](http://secunia.com/advisories/14299/).  To be honest, not everything is bad about AWStats. However, unless its security record improves, AWStats should only be used to generate static content or on a private web server.   | | AWStats | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Version: | 6.5 | | | Homepage: | <http://awstats.sourceforge.net/> | | | License: | GPL | | | Distributions: [?] | ■ Debian stable | ■ Debian unstable | |  | ■ Fedora | ■ Mandriva | |  | □ Suse | ■ Ubuntu | | Pros: |  | | Rating: 72 | | --- | | | * Customization with Extensions | | | Cons: |  | | * Poor Security * Few Filtering Options | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   Copyright 2006–2008  [OS Reviews](http://www.osreviews.net/).

Thank you, Hendrik, for passing along this information.

In this case, this report doesn't appear to be an actual security
vulnerability. The configuration file needs to be placed in
/etc/awstats, /usr/local/etc/awstats, /etc, or /etc/opt/awstats. This
can not be done without having root access (nor can the current
configuration files be modified without root access). Someone with root
permissions can already execute shell code with broader permissions than
the webserver, so this "attack" seems like a non-issue to me.

cheers,
Charles

Exploit #2: <http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?configdir=/tmp>

I see. So I assume that $LogFile must be run through Sanitize prior to
being opened, or at least checked for pipes?

I notcied the following related chunk of code:

    # Deny LogFile if contains a pipe and PurgeLogFile || ArchiveLogRecords set on
    if (($PurgeLogFile || $ArchiveLogRecords) && $LogFile =~ /\|\s*$/) {
        error("A pipe in log file name is not allowed if PurgeLogFile and ArchiveLogRecords are not set to 0");
    }

This suggests some previous thought about pipes. I'm trying to figure
out why they would ever be useful in a LogFile (since they are obviously
trying to account for them).

Is it correct to always deny pipes in LogFile?

I don't like that, because normally the config file should not be
writable by the web server.

Another solution would be to simply disable the configdir parameter.
