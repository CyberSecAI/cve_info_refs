Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1798:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from evuln.com specifically mentions "CVE-2006-1798" and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in a script named "RateIt", which directly aligns with the CVE ID, confirming relevance.

**2. Vulnerability details:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$rateit_id` parameter within the `rateit.php` script before it's used in an SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. This could lead to:
    *   Reading sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the server or system.
*   **Attack vector:**  The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to `rateit.php`, injecting SQL code into the `rateit_id` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server hosting the `rateit.php` script and have knowledge of the application's structure to inject the SQL code successfully.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Script:** `rateit.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `$rateit_id`
*   **Condition:** `magic_quotes_gpc = off`. This implies that the vulnerability is more easily exploitable when the magic_quotes_gpc feature of PHP is disabled, as it does not automatically escape certain characters.
*   **Exploit Example:** A sample HTML form is provided to demonstrate how to inject malicious SQL code via the `rateit_id` parameter. For example, `999' or 1/*` is injected to attempt to bypass SQL query logic.
*   **Affected Software:** RateIt 2.2. The website link for the software is `http://www.absoft-my.com/`.
*   **Solution:**  No solution is provided other than to check for vendor updates.

**Additional Notes:**
* The information from the evuln.com content appears to be more detailed than a standard CVE description, providing a specific vulnerable file, parameter, exploit examples and a prerequisite condition.
* The Secunia content is general and doesn't give specific details related to CVE-2006-1798, but refers to their service that researches vulnerabilities.
* The OVH content is unrelated.
