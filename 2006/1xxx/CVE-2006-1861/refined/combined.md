How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# NX 2.1: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200710-09**

NX in the 2.1 series uses XFree86 4.3 code which is prone to an integer
overflow vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/nx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.0** |

| Package | **net-misc/nxnode** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.0-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.0-r3** |

### Background

NoMachine's NX establishes remote connections to X11 desktops over
small bandwidth links. NX and NX Node are the compression core
libraries, whereas NX is used by FreeNX and NX Node by the binary-only
NX servers.

### Description

Chris Evans reported an integer overflow within the FreeType PCF font
file parser (CVE-2006-1861). NX and NX Node are vulnerable to this due
to shipping XFree86 4.3.0, which includes the vulnerable FreeType code.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these integer overflows by enticing a
user to load a specially crafted PCF font file which might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user on the
machine running the NX server.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nx-3.0.0"
```

All NX Node users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/nxnode-3.0.0-r3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:36:46 UTC  ``` Several integer overflow bugs in freetype have been fixed in CVS.  The details are below.  The descriptions are the CVS commit messages.  That patch for each particular comment is keyed off it's # identifier.  * Integer overflow      #2     * src/bdf/bdflib.c (ERRMSG4): New macro.       (_bdf_parse_glyphs): Handle invalid BBX values.     * include/freetype/fterrdef.h (FT_Err_Bbx_Too_Big): New error       macro.      #3     * src/sfnt/ttcmap.c (tt_face_build_cmaps): Handle invalid offset     correctly.      #4     * src/cff/cfftypes.h (CFF_CharsetRec): Add `max_cid' member.     * src/cff/cffload.c (cff_charset_load): Set `charset->max_cid'.     * src/cff/cffgload.c (cff_slot_load): Change type of third parameter     to `FT_UInt'.     Check range of `glyph_index'.     * src/cff/cffgload.h: Updated.      #6     * src/bdf/bdflib.c: fixed a problem with large encodings.     Again, this patch comes from Debian libfreetype6 for 2.1.10 !   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c1)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:41:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128558](attachment.cgi?id=128558&action=diff "Patch for issue #2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128558&action=edit "Patch for issue #2") Patch for issue #2   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:41:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128559](attachment.cgi?id=128559&action=diff "Patch for issue #3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128559&action=edit "Patch for issue #3") Patch for issue #3   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c3)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:42:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128561](attachment.cgi?id=128561&action=diff "Patch for issue #4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128561&action=edit "Patch for issue #4") Patch for issue #4   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c4)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:43:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128562](attachment.cgi?id=128562&action=diff "Fix for issue #6") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128562&action=edit "Fix for issue #6") Fix for issue #6   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c5)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 19:48:04 UTC  ``` These issues should also affect RHEL3 and RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c6)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-03 20:22:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128565](attachment.cgi?id=128565&action=diff "Fix for a minor DoS issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128565&action=edit "Fix for a minor DoS issue") Fix for a minor DoS issue  Here is a patch for a minor DoS issue as well.	It doesn't have a CVE id (it may get one, but probably doesn't deserve one).  Please fix it when applying the above patches.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c7)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-04 16:42:47 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 190693](show_bug.cgi?id=190693 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - freetype memory allocaton integer overflow") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c8)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-04 16:44:26 UTC  ``` [Bug 190693](show_bug.cgi?id=190693 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - freetype memory allocaton integer overflow") has been marked a duplicate of this bug as it contains the patch for additional integer overflows which are covered by [CVE-2006-1861](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1861).    Upstream has fixed a number of potential integer overflows when allocating memory by modifying how memory is now allocated.  The patch take from CVS, then clean up is very large.  I don't know the source well enough to determine how much of this is needed for our packages.  [Attachment 128606](attachment.cgi?id=128606&action=diff "Patch extracted from upstream CVS") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128606&action=edit "Patch extracted from upstream CVS") is a patch extracted from upstream CVS    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c9)  Matthew Barnes    2006-05-05 21:30:33 UTC  ``` RHEL 3 and RHEL 4 packages are built, will do RHEL 2.1 next week.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c10)  Matthew Barnes    2006-05-10 19:19:10 UTC  ``` RHEL 2.1 packages are built.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c13)  Josh Bressers    2006-05-15 17:56:31 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c15)  Tobias Sandhaas    2006-07-17 09:16:20 UTC  ``` I am eagerly waiting for an advisory and rpm pakets for this (and other) sever issue with freetype. Is there a reason to delay the release?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c16)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-17 14:55:20 UTC  ``` Tobias; updated packages are likely to be pushed this week this week once QA is completed.  They were delayed whilst we dealt with other issues that were of a higher security severity.     ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c17)  Mark J. Cox    2006-07-18 09:37:29 UTC  ``` Our maintainer whilst building the packages for [CVE-2006-1861](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1861) noticed that the upstream patch seemed to be insufficient to correct bad1.pcf from the test suite.  He corrected it.  Since other vendors have already released updates we need a new CVE name for this issue, [CVE-2006-3467](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-3467).  vendor-sec notified yesterday.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=190593#c18)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-07-18 10:05:19 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0500.html>    ``` |  |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- hplip command injection
The daemon 'hpssd' could be exploited by users to execute arbitrary
commands as root. hpssd only runs on systems that have HP all-in-one
devices configured. In the default configuration the problem is
not remotely exploitable as hpssd only listens on local interfaces
(CVE-2007-5208).
This issue has been fixed for SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop 10.
- kdelibs3, kdebase3 security update
kdebase3 and kdelibs3 were updated on all affected SUSE Linux
products to fix the following problems:
- Users could log in as root without having to enter the password
if auto login was enabled and if kdm was configured to require
the root password to shutdown the system (CVE-2007-4569).
- Javascript code could modify the URL in the address bar to make
the currently displayed web site appear to come from a different
site (CVE-2007-4224).
- NX security update for PCF handling
The XFree code contained in NX was prone to integer overflows
(CVE-2006-1861) and insufficiently protected against specially
crafted PCF files (CVE-2006-3467).
NX has been updated on SUSE Linux 10.0-10.3, it is not contained
on other distributions.
- festival daemon command injection
The festival daemon runs as root (if started). The default config
doesn't have a password set. A local attacker could therefore connect
to the daemon to have commands executed as root (CVE-2007-4074).
festival has been updated on all affected products.
- opal denial of service problem
The opal library contained a bug in the SIP protocol handler that
could be exploited by attackers to crash applications using opal
(CVE-2007-4924).
Opal has been updated on openSUSE 10.2, 10.3 and SUSE Linux
Desktop 10.
- openssl DTLS problem
A buffer overflow in the DTLS implementation of openssl could
be exploited by attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2007-4995).
openssl has been updated on all distributions that contain DTLS
support.
It is questionable if the DTLS support even worked before or used
by applications at all, so we were likely not affected.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-26 08:05:25 UTC  ``` This is an automatically created tracking bug! It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in all affected branches.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against "Security Response" product referenced in "Blocks" field.  	[bug #484437](show_bug.cgi?id=484437 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2006-1861 freetype: multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities"): [CVE-2006-1861](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1861) freetype: multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities 	[bug #240200](show_bug.cgi?id=240200 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-2754 freetype integer overflow"): [CVE-2007-2754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-2754) freetype integer overflow   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-26 08:09:30 UTC  ``` These old issues were previously fixed in FT2, but parts apply to FT1 as well.  The fixes were included in RHEL freetype packages update (which contain both FT1 and FT2 on RHEL-2.1 - RHEL-4):    <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0329.html>  All current Fedora branches should contain same FT1 version with identical patches, so this should apply to all.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-26 08:15:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 345396](attachment.cgi?id=345396&action=diff "FT1 CVE-2006-1861 patch as used in RHSA") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=345396&action=edit "FT1 CVE-2006-1861 patch as used in RHSA") FT1 [CVE-2006-1861](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1861) patch as used in RHSA   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-26 08:16:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 345397](attachment.cgi?id=345397&action=diff "FT1 CVE-2007-2754 patch as used in RHSA") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=345397&action=edit "FT1 CVE-2007-2754 patch as used in RHSA") FT1 [CVE-2007-2754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-2754) patch as used in RHSA   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-26 20:55:07 UTC  ``` freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc10>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-26 20:55:53 UTC  ``` freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c6)  Alexei Podtelezhnikov    2009-05-26 21:26:18 UTC  ``` Would you please fix a typo ("obsolote") in the package description and make it more obvious that it is an old-old library by moving the second paragraph upfront?  I am curious which package still uses it and why we cannot drop this old library. Nobody should use it any longer.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-27 06:44:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c6)) > I am curious which package still uses it and why we cannot drop this old > library.  $ repoquery -q --whatrequires 'libttf.so.2()(64bit)' freetype1-0:1.4-0.6.pre.fc10.x86_64 freetype1-utils-0:1.4-0.6.pre.fc10.x86_64 MagicPoint-0:1.11b-7.fc10.x86_64 freetype1-devel-0:1.4-0.6.pre.fc10.x86_64  Looks like only MagicPoint now.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-27 06:46:47 UTC  ``` Ah, looks like Ajax already did few steps to get rid of that last dependency either:  <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/MagicPoint/devel/MagicPoint.spec#rev1.11>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c9)  Adam Jackson    2009-05-27 17:24:24 UTC  ``` freetype1 is a dead package in F12.  We could remove it in F11 without too much hassle but I didn't think it was worth it given how close to release we are.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-28 08:00:59 UTC  ``` freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=502565#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-28 08:17:02 UTC  ``` freetype1-1.4-0.8.pre.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

# FreeType: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200607-02**

Multiple remotely exploitable buffer overflows have been discovered in
FreeType, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/freetype** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.10-r2**< **2.0** |

### Background

FreeType is a portable font engine.

### Description

Multiple integer overflows exist in a variety of files (bdf/bdflib.c,
sfnt/ttcmap.c, cff/cffgload.c, base/ftmac.c).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these buffer overflows by enticing a
user to load a specially crafted font, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.1.10-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

freetype security update (RHSA-2006-0500)

Original Release Date: August 30, 2006

Last Revised: September 13, 2007

Number: ASA-2006-176

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

FreeType is a free, high-quality, and portable font engine.

FreeType was found to contain numerous integer underflow and overflow
vulnerabilities in its font rendering engine. If an attacker could trick a
user into loading a specially constructed font file in an application linked
to a vulnerable version of FreeType, the application could possibly crash
or execute arbitrary code as the user. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-0747](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0747),
[CVE-2006-1861](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1861), and
[CVE-2006-3467](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3467) to these issues.

Additionally, FreeType was found to crash when loading a malformed font file
due to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-2661](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2661) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0500.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with freetype installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | Prior to CM3.1 | Low | Upgrade to CM3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to Intuity LX 2.0 or later. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to MSS 3.1 or later |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | Upgrade to MN 3.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of freetype, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

Upstream has fixed a number of potential integer overflows when allocating memory by modifying how memory is now allocated.  The patch take from CVS, then clean up is very large.

# FreeType: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200607-02**

Multiple remotely exploitable buffer overflows have been discovered in
FreeType, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/freetype** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.10-r2**< **2.0** |

### Background

FreeType is a portable font engine.

### Description

Multiple integer overflows exist in a variety of files (bdf/bdflib.c,
sfnt/ttcmap.c, cff/cffgload.c, base/ftmac.c).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these buffer overflows by enticing a
user to load a specially crafted font, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.1.10-r2"
```
