Additional information will be added soon. If your database (only database!!!) is not using mod\_plsql, Oracle Spatial and Enterprise Manager reporting, there are only 7 security issues left.- DB07 (EM Agent) is only exploitable from an OS account on the database server. In many cases this risk is acceptable because a normal user should never have OS access to the database server. - DB01, DB02, DB03, DB05, DB06 are bug fixes for SQL Injection issues in database packages. Only DB01 (DBMS\_REPUTIL),   DB03 (DBMS\_SNAPSHOT\_UTL) and DB05 ([DBMS\_EXPORT\_EXTENSION](http://www.red-database-security.com/exploits/oracle-sql-injection-oracle-dbms_export_extension.html)) are granted to PUBLIC. Revoking the privilege from these 3 packages to public could mitigate the risk. If these vulnerable packages are needed you should create a custom role and assign this custom role. The first exploit for the bug DB05 was already posted on bugtraq. - DB04 requires the ability to enable constraints. Additional details are currently not available .   A short analysis of the Oracle spatial bug fixes (DB08-DB13) shows that 1 bugfix is incorrect for Oracle 9.2.0.7 and one parameter in this spatial package is accidentially not sanitized properly. Oracle handles this a a new bug (7520291) which will be fixed in a upcoming patchset.   Keep in mind that Oracle 10g XE (eXpress Edition) is also affected but not mentioned in the April CPU 2006. Patches for Oracle XE are currently NOT available. We tested the [exploit](http://www.red-database-security.com/exploits/oracle-sql-injection-oracle-dbms_export_extension.html) for dbms\_export\_extension on Oracle XE for Windows and the exploit works as expected.   With this CPU Oracle has fixed 36 security bugs in various products and components:     | Database | 13 | | --- | --- | | MOD\_PLSQL | 1 | | OCS | 4 | | APPS | 13 | | OPA | 1 | | EM | 2 | | PSE | 1 | | JDE | 1 |   The [view bug](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_modify_data_via_views.html) affecting all versions from 9.1.0.0 until 10.2.0.3 is, as expected, not fixed in this CPU.

## Oracle Export component SQL injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#452681

Original Release Date: 2006-04-20 | Last Revised: 2006-05-03

---

### Overview

An SQL injection vulnerability in the Oracle Export component may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on a vulnerable Oracle installation.

### Description

| Oracle Export component contains a SQL injection vulnerability.The details of this vulnerability are not clear. We believe that the Export component is accessible by users with PUBLIC privileges.  Based on research into public [information](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_cpu_apr_2006.html), we believe that this issue is Oracle vuln# DB05 in the [Oracle CPU for April 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuapr2006.html). However, there is not sufficient information to authoritatively relate Oracle vulnerability information to information provided by other parties.  Refer to the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for April 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuapr2006.html) for more information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute SQL queries on a server, possibly with elevated privileges. As a result, attackers may be able to view or modify the contents of an Oracle database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply patches** This issue is corrected in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for April 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpuapr2006.html). |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
