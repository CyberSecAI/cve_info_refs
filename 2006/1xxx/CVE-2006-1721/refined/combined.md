How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

cyrus-sasl security and bug fix update (RHSA-2007-0795)

Original Release Date: October 15, 2007

Last Revised: January 23, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-426

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The cyrus-sasl package is the Cyrus implementation of the Simple
Authentication
and Security Layer (SASL), which is a method for authenticating stateful
protocols.

A vulnerability has been reported in cyrus-sasl's DIGEST-MD5
authentication
mechanism which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a
denial of service.
This vulnerability only affects Avaya systems where LDAP is configured.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1721](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1721)
to this issue.

This errata also fixes the following bugs:

* The Kerberos 5 library included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
  was not
  thread safe. This update adds functionality which allows it to be used
  safely in a threaded application.
* Several memory leak bugs were fixed in cyrus-sasl's DIGEST-MD5
  authentication plug-in.
* /dev/urandom is now used by default on systems which don't support
  hwrandom. Previously, /dev/random was the default.
* cyrus-sasl needs zlib-devel to build properly. This dependency
  information is now included in the package.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0795.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with cyrus-sasl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 5.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.1 or later |
| Avaya Intuity LX | IALX 2.0 SP1 and earlier. | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2 or later. |
| Avaya EMMC | All | Low | This will not be addressed as no further releases of EMMC are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.0 or later |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 5.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.0, 4.1 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
cyrus-sasl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem description:

a. VMware Tools Local Privilege Escalation on Windows-based guest OS

The VMware Tools Package provides support required for shared folders
(HGFS) and other features.

An input validation error is present in the Windows-based VMware
HGFS.sys driver. Exploitation of this flaw might result in
arbitrary code execution on the guest system by an unprivileged
guest user. It doesn't matter on what host the Windows guest OS
is running, as this is a guest driver vulnerability and not a
vulnerability on the host.

The HGFS.sys driver is present in the guest operating system if the
VMware Tools package is loaded. Even if the host has HGFS disabled
and has no shared folders, Windows-based guests may be affected. This
is regardless if a host supports HGFS.

This issue could be mitigated by removing the VMware Tools package
from Windows based guests. However this is not recommended as it
would impact usability of the product.

NOTE: Installing the new hosted release or ESX patches will not
remediate the issue. The VMware Tools packages will need
to be updated on each Windows-based guest followed by a
reboot of the guest system.

VMware would like to thank iDefense and Stephen Fewer of Harmony
Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2007-5671 to this issue.

b. Privilege escalation on ESX or Linux based hosted operating systems

This update fixes a security issue related to local exploitation of
an untrusted library path vulnerability in vmware-authd. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and
the ability to execute the set-uid vmware-authd binary on an affected
system. Exploitation of this flaw might result in arbitrary code
execution on the Linux host system by an unprivileged user.

VMware would like to thank iDefense for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

c. Openwsman Invalid Content-Length Vulnerability

Openwsman is a system management platform that implements the Web
Services Management protocol (WS-Management). It is installed and
running by default. It is used in the VMware Management Service
Console and in ESXi.

The openwsman management service on ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 is vulnerable
to a privilege escalation vulnerability, which may allow users with
non-privileged ESX or Virtual Center accounts to gain root privileges.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need a local ESX
account or a VirtualCenter account with the Host.Cim.CimInteraction
permission.

Systems with no local ESX accounts and no VirtualCenter accounts with
the Host.Cim.CimInteraction permission are not vulnerable.

This vulnerability cannot be exploited by users without valid login
credentials.

Vulnerabilities

The VIX API (also known as "Vix") is an API that lets users write scripts
and programs to manipulate virtual machines.

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities are present in the VIX API.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might result in a privilege
escalation on the host system. This exploit scenario is relevant for all
affected products. On VC, ESX30x, and ESX35, users need to have the VM
Interaction Privilege in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might also result in code execution on
the host system from the guest system or on the service console in ESX Server
from the guest operating system. This exploit scenario is relevant for
Workstation 6.0.x (version 6.0.3 and below), Player 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and
below), ACE 2.0.x (version 2.0.3 and below), Server 1.0.x (version 1.0.5 and
below), and ESX3.5. The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" in the VMware
configuration file must be set to true to allow for exploitation on these
products. Note that the parameter "vix-inGuest.enable" is set to false by
default.

The parameter "vix.inGuest.enable" is present in the
following products:

VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and higher
VMware ACE 6.0.2 and higher
VMware Server 1.06 and higher
VMware Fusion 1.1.2 and higher
ESX Server 3.0 and higher
ESX Server 3.5 and higher

In previous versions of VMware products where the VIX API was introduced,
the VIX API couldn't be disabled.

This vulnerability is present in ESX and the hosted products even if you
have not installed the VIX API. To patch your system you will need to
update to the new hosted product version or to apply the appropriate ESX
patch. It is not necessary to update the VIX API if you have installed
the VIX API.

VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of
Defense for reporting this issue.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-2100 to this issue.

##### II Service Console rpm updates

NOTE: ESXi and hosted products are not affected by any service console security updates

##### a. Security update for cyrus-sasl

Updated cyrus-sasl package for the ESX Service Console corrects a security
issue found in the DIGEST-MD5 authentication mechanism of Cyrus'
implementation of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL). As a
result of this issue in the authentication mechanism, a remote
unauthenticated attacker might be able to cause a denial of service error
on the service console.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2006-1721 to this issue.

RPMs Updated:

##### b. Security update for tcltk

An input validation flaw was discovered in Tk's GIF image handling. A
code-size value read from a GIF image was not properly validated before
being used, leading to a buffer overflow. A specially crafted GIF file
could use this to cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the
privileges of the application using the Tk graphical toolkit.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2008-0553 to this issue.

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in Tk's animated GIF image handling.
An animated GIF containing an initial image smaller than subsequent images
could cause a crash or, potentially, execute code with the privileges of
the application using the Tk library.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2007-5378 to this issue.

A flaw first discovered in the Tcl regular expression engine used in the
PostgreSQL database server, resulted in an infinite loop when processing
certain regular expressions.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2007-4772 to this issue.

fixes a flaw in unzip. An attacker could execute malicious code with a
user's privileges if the user ran unzip on a file designed to leverage
this flaw.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2008-0888 to this issue.

ESX 2.5.4 ESX ESX 2.5.4 Upgrade Patch 19

##### d. Security update for krb5

KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not set a global variable
for some krb4 message types, which allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via crafted messages that trigger a NULL pointer dereference
or double-free.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0062 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

The Kerberos 4 support in KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not
properly clear the unused portion of a buffer when generating an
error message, which might allow remote attackers to obtain
sensitive information, aka "Uninitialized stack values."

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0063 to this issue.

NOTE: ESX doesn't contain the krb5kdc binary and is not vulnerable
to this issue.

Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc\_dtablesize.c) used
by libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably
other versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h
does not define the FD\_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
triggering a large number of open file descriptors.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2008-0948 to this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1042-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
April 25th, 2006                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cyrus-sasl2
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-1721
BugTraq ID     : 17446
Debian Bug     : 361937

The Mu Security research team discovered a denial of service condition
in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer authentication library
(SASL) during DIGEST-MD5 negotiation.  This potentially affects
multiple products that use SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication including
OpenLDAP, Sendmail, Postfix, etc.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.19-1.5sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.19.dfsg1-0.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-sasl2 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
