How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Multiple buffer overflows in BSDgames 2.17-1 and privileges escalation
vulnerability.
Date: Wed, 05 Apr 2006 17:40:36 -0300
```
Package: BSDgames
Version: 2.17-1

The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors when reading
the player's name in pl_main.c

code segment:
printf("Your name, Captain? ");
		fflush(stdout);
		fgets(captain, sizeof captain, stdin);
		if (!*captain)
			strcpy(captain, "no name");
		else
		    captain[strlen(captain) - 1] = '\0';
	}

Being captain initialized as: char captain[80].

There is some similar issues in Tetris, and Hack too.

This can be exploited by users to gain gid=games an then to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when
other users run the game, by modifying entries in a game file like scores in Tetris or Hack.

Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of other users.

Well... english isnt my first language and i dont know if the bugs can be reported in spanish so i hope to be understandeable

sizeof(captain) is 80 so fgets reads in at most 79 characters. The trailing
NULL will be added as the 80th character which still seems to be within
the array size to me.

Well feel free to provide the details of those issues.
