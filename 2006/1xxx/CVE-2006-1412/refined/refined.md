    "Content": "The provided content is an exploit script for TFT Gallery 0.10. It details a vulnerability that allows for password disclosure.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The application stores the administrator password hash in a publicly accessible file (`admin/passwd`).\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: Password disclosure vulnerability due to insecure storage of password hashes.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker can retrieve the administrator's password hash, and in this specific case, the script also checks if it matches the default hash, revealing the plaintext password to be 'admin' if it matches. If the hash is not the default, the attacker can try to crack the password offline.\n\nAttack vectors: An attacker sends a GET request to the `/admin/passwd` file on the vulnerable server.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.",
    "Other": "The exploit script is written in Perl and automates the process of retrieving the password hash and checking against the default hash."
