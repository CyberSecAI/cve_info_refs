  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1300",
      "root_cause": "ASP.NET 2.0 does not properly validate the URL passed, allowing for unauthorized access to objects within the Application folders.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper URL validation",
         "Information Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could bypass ASP.NET security and gain unauthorized access to objects in the Application folders by knowing or guessing their names. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information that can be used for further compromise of the system.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack over the Internet",
        "Accessing a web site that contains an Application Folder."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to make HTTP requests to a web server",
         "Knowledge of or ability to guess file names in application folders."
      ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability does not allow for direct code execution or privilege escalation, but the disclosed information can be used to further compromise the system. The risk is mitigated if directory browsing is disabled and by default, file extensions that are used by Visual Studio and ASP.NET web projects are mapped to aspnet_isapi.dll which prevents their remote retrieval.  Also, IIS 6.0 will not serve files without MIME mapping.  Systems that have implemented URLScan with the recommended settings for hardening ASP.NET applications are less vulnerable."
