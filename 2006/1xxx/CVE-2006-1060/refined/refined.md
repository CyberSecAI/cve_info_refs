Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-1060:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a programming error in how `zgv` and `xzgv` handle JPEG images within the CMYK/YCCK color space. These image viewers attempt to decode these images incorrectly.
*   **Weakness:**  The incorrect handling of JPEG images in CMYK/YCCK color space leads to a buffer overflow (CWE-119).
*   **Impact:** This could allow for arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is remote. An attacker could potentially exploit this by providing a specially crafted JPEG image.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this.

**Affected Software:**

*   `zgv` (svgalib graphics viewer)
*   `xzgv` (picture viewer for X with a thumbnail-based selector)

**Versions Affected:**

*   **zgv**:
    *   Old stable distribution (woody): versions prior to 5.5-3woody3.
    *   Stable distribution (sarge): versions prior to 5.7-1.4.
*   **xzgv:**
    *   Old stable distribution (woody): versions prior to 0.7-6woody3.
    *   Stable distribution (sarge): versions prior to 0.8-3sarge1.

**Resolution:**

*   Upgrade to the fixed versions of the `zgv` and `xzgv` packages.
*   For Debian systems, instructions and links to the corrected packages are provided in the Debian Security Advisories DSA 1037-1 (for `zgv`) and DSA 1038-1 (for `xzgv`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Barisani.
*   The vulnerability is not specific to Debian.

**CVSS Metrics (from securityreason.com):**
*   **Base Score:** 7.5/10
*   **Impact Subscore:** 6.4/10
*   **Exploitability Subscore:** 10/10
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Partial
*   **Integrity Impact:** Partial
*    **Availability Impact**: Partial
