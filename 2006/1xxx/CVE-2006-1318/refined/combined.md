### General Information

## Executive Summary

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**I am updating the administrative installation points and I noticed that there are two .mspâs. Why?**

Limitations in our security update detection logic necessitate us having two separate updates. This is because the file being updated, mso.dll, ships in so many products that if we used a single .MSP to target them all, the detection logic in the MSP would be too large for our detection tools to consume. We are actively working on resolving this limitation.

**The administrative installation points lists mso.msp and pvmso.msp. Do I need to install both packages?**

Yes, the mso.msp targets most of the Office products, such as Word and Excel. The pvmso.msp targets additional Office products, such as Visio, Project and OneNote. In order to be secure you will need to install both packages.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin IDs and affected software are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft Office 2003 | Microsoft Office XP, Project 2002 Service Pack 1, and Visio 2002 Service Pack 2 | Microsoft Office 2000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MS05-005](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-005) | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac | No | No |
| Microsoft Office v. X for Mac | No | No |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/downloads/tools/msupdates.mspx). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Office Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office, and could be exploited when a malformed string included in an Office file was parsed by any of the affected Office applications.  Such a string might be included in an email attachment processed by one of the affected applications or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed email message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Office file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* On Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must accept a prompt confirming that they **Open**, **Save** or **Cancel** the attachment that is sent in an e-mail message before the exploit could occur.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**Note** Office 2000 does not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from un-trusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources.**

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Office parses the length of a record before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
