  "CVE-2006-1318": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A malformed control within an Office file, when parsed, can corrupt system memory, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper parsing of malformed controls within Office files, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of an affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted Office files containing malformed controls can be delivered via email attachments or hosted on malicious websites. The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the specially crafted file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Office file with a malformed control and persuade the user to open the file. This can be achieved through phishing emails or by hosting the file on a website the user visits."
