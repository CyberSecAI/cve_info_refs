Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1388:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles HTML Applications (HTA). Specifically, an HTA can be initiated in a way that bypasses IE's security controls, allowing it to execute without displaying the normal security dialog box.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper handling of HTA files in Internet Explorer.
- Failure to enforce security checks when initiating HTA files.
- Bypassing of security dialogs that should be displayed before executing HTA files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could grant an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This could lead to:

- Complete control over the affected system.
- Installation of malicious programs.
- Viewing, modification, or deletion of data.
- Creation of new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**

- Web-based attack: An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted HTML page that triggers the vulnerability.
- E-mail: While not directly exploitable through preview panes, a user could be vulnerable if they click on a malicious link in an email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Ability to host a malicious web page.
- Social engineering to persuade users to visit the attacker's website or click a malicious link.

**Additional details from the analyzed content:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for most versions of Internet Explorer by Microsoft.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft released a security update (MS06-013) to address the issue.
- Workarounds were suggested including unregistering mshta.exe, modifying access control lists and disabling active scripting.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jeffrey van der Stad.
- The vulnerability exists because an HTML Application (HTA) can be initiated in a way that bypasses the security control within Internet Explorer. This allows an HTA to execute without Internet Explorer displaying the normal security dialog box.
