  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The game does not properly validate the size of incoming packets and the uncompressed size of compressed data, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "A] Socket Unreachable: The game enters an infinite loop when receiving packets of 0 length or larger than 4096 bytes due to lack of proper handling by the asynchronous socket, preventing new clients from joining.",
    "B] Decompression Crash: A buffer overflow exists in the decompression of packets because the application does not check the 'comprLength' value provided by the attacker, leading to a program crash."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": [
    "A] Socket Unreachable: Denial of service, preventing new clients from connecting and requiring a server restart.",
    "B] Decompression Crash: Program termination due to buffer overflow."
    ],
  "Attack vectors": [
      "A] Socket Unreachable: Sending crafted network packets with 0 length or larger than 4096 bytes to the server",
      "B] Decompression Crash: Sending crafted compressed packets with an invalid 'comprLength' that causes a buffer overflow during decompression."
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to the server. This would be anyone on the same network as the server or connected through the internet."
