      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests and/or post content to the vulnerable scripts.",
     "details": "The vulnerability is present in aWebBB version 1.2. Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in scripts such as post.php, register.php, and editac.php, where parameters like tname, fpost, fullname, emailadd, country, sig, otherav are not properly sanitized. Additionally, BBCodes are not properly sanitized, enabling the injection of arbitrary HTML or web script code. Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are also present in scripts like accounts.php, changep.php, dpost.php, editac.php, feedback.php, fpass.php, list.php, login.php, ndis.php, post.php, reply.php, reply_log.php, and search.php. Parameters such as Username, p, c, and q are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries, allowing for arbitrary SQL code injection. The SQL injection requires that `magic_quotes_gpc` be off."
