# NetHack, Slash'EM, Falcon's Eye: Local privilege escalation — GLSA **200603-23**

NetHack, Slash'EM and Falcon's Eye are vulnerable to local privilege
escalation vulnerabilities that could potentially allow the execution of
arbitrary code as other users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-roguelike/nethack** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **3.4.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **games-roguelike/falconseye** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.9.4a** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **games-roguelike/slashem** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **0.0.760** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

NetHack is the classic single player dungeon exploration game. Slash'EM
and Falcon's Eye are NetHack variants.

### Description

NetHack, Slash'EM and Falcon's Eye have been found to be incompatible
with the system used for managing games on Gentoo Linux. As a result,
they cannot be played securely on systems with multiple users.

### Impact

A local user who is a member of group "games" may be able to modify the
state data used by NetHack, Slash'EM or Falcon's Eye to trigger the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of other players.
Additionally, the games may create save game files in a manner not
suitable for use on Gentoo Linux, potentially allowing a local user to
create or overwrite files with the permissions of other players.

### Workaround

Do not add untrusted users to the "games" group.

### Resolution

NetHack has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. Vulnerable NetHack users are advised to uninstall the package
until further notice.

```
 # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge "games-roguelike/nethack"
```

Slash'EM has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. Vulnerable Slash'EM users are advised to uninstall the package
until further notice.

```
 # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge "games-roguelike/slashem"
```

Falcon's Eye has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. Vulnerable Falcon's Eye users are advised to uninstall the
package until further notice.

```
 # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge "games-roguelike/falconseye"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-10 07:55:14 UTC  ``` As gentoo doesnt follow the standard of setting games to setgid a low privileged group, any user in group games can create symlinks in /var/games/nethack/save, allowing them to trick other users to overwriting or creating files.  reproduce:  cd /var/games/nethack/save ln -s /any/file/victim/owns <uid><username>.bz2  now get victim to run nethack, when they save their game target file will be overwritten or created.  This only affects gentoo, and is not a bug in nethack. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-10 12:13:09 UTC  ``` See, this is not *at all* what you explained to me this morning.  Had you used *this* example, you would have convinced me that *something* needs to be done to resolve this.  I'm still not convinced that setgid is the answer, but something should be done. =] ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-11 14:01:26 UTC  ``` Games team, please advise ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-21 09:50:17 UTC  ``` Late. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-12 03:41:49 UTC  ``` Regrouping nethack / group games issues.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [125902](show_bug.cgi?id=125902 "RESOLVED FIXED - <games-roguelike/nethack-3.4.3-r2: local privilege escalation and insecure savegame creation (CVE-2006-1390)") *** ``` |  |

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

| [Description](#c0)  David Holm    2002-01-10 15:56:30 UTC  ``` Hi, my man stopped working. I don't know which package broke it... Now all I get is: bash-2.05a$ man write sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `)' sh: -c: line 1: `(cd /usr/man && (echo ".pl 1100i"; gzip -c -d '/usr/man/man1/write.1.gz'; echo; echo ".pl \n(nlu+10") | nroff -mandoc | )' Error executing formatting or display command. System command (cd /usr/man && (echo ".pl 1100i"; gzip -c -d '/usr/man/man1/write.1.gz'; echo; echo ".pl \n(nlu+10") | nroff -mandoc | ) exited with status 2. No manual entry for write ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-11 12:02:45 UTC  ``` David, could you do a bit more research?  What packages did you merge recently?  We really need more information to track down this bug. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas    2002-01-11 16:33:25 UTC  ``` Looks to me that you are missing nroff  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Lars S. Jensen    2002-01-20 06:50:08 UTC  ``` Version: sys-apps/man-1.5i-r1  after 'nroff -mandoc | ' should there be a '/usr/bin/less -is'.  It is missing the default expantion of MANPAGER:         MANPAGER               If  MANPAGER  is set, its value is used as the name               of the program to use to display the man page.   If               not,  then  PAGER  is  used.  If  that has no value               either, /usr/bin/less -is is used.  Setting "export MANPAGER='/usr/bin/less -is'" and it works!  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-20 10:04:40 UTC  ``` OK.  Was MANAPAGER set in your shell before?  How about PAGER? I'd like to track this down. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Aaron Malone    2002-01-21 18:04:59 UTC  ``` It looks like PAGER needs to be set in /etc/man.conf.  If neither PAGER nor MANPAGER are set in the user's environment, man falls back onto the PAGER setting in /etc/man.conf.  Changing (line 83 on my system):  PAGER  to  PAGER        /usr/bin/less -is  fixes the problem. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-25 23:28:24 UTC  ``` fixed on cvs ``` |  |

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-12 01:11:41 UTC  ``` nethack doesnt expect users to be able to set their own high scores or manipulate state files, on most UNIX-like systems this is true, but for some reason not on gentoo, where users are added to group games, rather than having group games reserved as a special group to prevent tampering with high scores and so on.  from readentry() in topten.c:  ...     static const char fmt33[] = "%s %s %s %s %[^,],%[^\n]%*c"; ... else if (fscanf(rfile, fmt33,                 tt->plrole, tt->plrace, tt->plgend,                 tt->plalign, tt->name, tt->death) != 6)             tt->points = 0; ...  unchecked fscanf() from the group games writable record file in /var/games/nethack.  I could create a record entry that will overflow a heap buffer and execute arbitrary code with the rights of any users who play nethack.  Also note that there are most likely many more of these bugs, and as I can create save games as any user, that are automatically read when those users play nethack.  reproduce:   perl -e 'print "3.4.3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 FOO BAR FOO BAR FOO,","A"x"50000","\n"' > /var/games/nethack/record  then when you die (or use nethack -s), nethack reads the file.  Note this is not a bug in nethack, it's due to gentoo's group games policy. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-12 03:00:17 UTC  ``` games team: please advise how you want to proceed. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-12 03:41:05 UTC  ``` Regrouping issues, same cause for two bugs :  ========================= As gentoo doesnt follow the standard of setting games to setgid a low privileged group, any user in group games can create symlinks in /var/games/nethack/save, allowing them to trick other users to overwriting or creating files.  reproduce:  cd /var/games/nethack/save ln -s /any/file/victim/owns <uid><username>.bz2  now get victim to run nethack, when they save their game target file will be overwritten or created.  This only affects gentoo, and is not a bug in nethack. ==================================== ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-12 03:41:49 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 122376](show_bug.cgi?id=122376 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - games-roguelike/nethack: insecure save game creation") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-17 06:37:19 UTC  ``` games team give permission to mask until a fix is available ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-21 12:57:19 UTC  ``` masked pending resolution of this issue, do we want a maskglsa? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-21 13:28:55 UTC  ``` This is a B2 issue, so unless games is planning to fix this fast we need a masking glsa. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-21 14:44:30 UTC  ``` The problem with us taking any quick action on this is fairly simple.  The Gentoo games team has a policy where we restrict who can run games based on the games group.  This is similar to how performing raw reads on cdrom devices is limited to the cdrom group, or how running vmware-workstation is limited to the vmware group.  This has been in place for a long time and is well-received by our users.  To revert this behavior is not something that we wish to do, nor something that can be accomplished overnight as *all* games ebuilds rely on this behavior.  Our thinking has always been that the system's administrator puts only trusted people in the games group and that he understands that they will be able to run these games.  While I do see the points brought up in these recent bugs, they seem to completely ignore that the way the Gentoo games team does this is what is wanted by our users.  Now, we don't have a better solution just yet, but we are working on it.  Feel free to mask the games that are showing problems such as these until we can come up with a proper solution that is acceptable to us without removing current functionality, nor being vulnerable to these issues. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-21 16:10:18 UTC  ``` Restricting who can access specific hardware and potentially dangerous applications is quite different from restricting who can access games. Nobody would expect granting permission to play games would allow them to compromise other users accounts or disrupt other users legitimate use of the games, but this is exactly what can happen.  what functionality is it that you dont want to remove, the ability to limit who can execute games? I've already suggested how this can be achieved in an email to vapier without breaking high scores, security, etc. I never received any reply though, if you'd like me to bounce you a copy just ping me on irc. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Mr. Bones. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-21 16:12:59 UTC  ``` please send email like that to games@gentoo.org ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Raymond Lewis Rebbeck    2006-03-22 03:05:52 UTC  ``` Is this an issue for games-roguelike/slashem as well? If so it should also be masked. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 03:27:48 UTC  ``` Thanks Raymond, you are correct, slashem is also affected, filed as [bug 127167](show_bug.cgi?id=127167 "RESOLVED INVALID - games-roguelike/slashem: insecure save game creation and local priv escalation(CVE-2006-1390)") ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 07:40:26 UTC  ``` I agree with jaervosz, we need a mask glsa if there is no change coming soon, which is probably not the case according to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c7) ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 07:46:40 UTC  ``` Yup, we'll need a masking GLSA if there's no fix soon. Games team, could you please comment when you expect to have this fixed? ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 08:26:57 UTC  ``` As I stated before, for this to be "fixed" requires a complete rethinking of how we do games on Gentoo, requiring us to make modifications to our eclasses which affect ~750 packages, along with determining how to come up with a clean upgrade path for our users which already have games installed and established on their systems.  Needless to say, there's no expectation on this happening any time soon.  If you want my opinion on it, I would say we simply mask the packages and let the users decide on their own if the risk is worth it, but I know that this is definitely not the optimal solution, but until we have another workable solution that is agreeable to our members, this will be our current course of action. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  David Grant    2006-03-22 09:21:42 UTC  ``` What is the reason for having the ability for only certain users to able to run games (ie. the existence of a games group). It would seem that one could start creating groups for all sorts of applications. Is there are group called "office"? Is there a group called "graphics"? Why I need to be in a group called games to play games is a mystery to me. If a sysadmin wanted to restrict the use of "office" applications to certain users, he would have to do some extra work, no? Why not make them do the same thing for games?  Chris said: "This has been in place for a long time and is well-received by our users."  Why is it well-received? What is so great about it?  Tavis said: "what functionality is it that you dont want to remove, the ability to limit who can execute games?

Tavis: Why not post this email here?  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-22 13:18:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c15)) > What is the reason for having the ability for only certain users to able to run > games (ie. the existence of a games group).

Except that I don't care about "office" stuff, since I'm on the games team.  Quite frankly, I'm a bit put off by the fact that our policies are under attack like this.  Nobody has made any complaints about this policy until this bug came about, and even those people seem to be complaining just to complain.  Want a reason why we restrict games to a specific group?  How about limiting who can run games that are extremely resource intensive?  How about keeping your kids from playing doom3?  Need any more reasons?  Well, I'm sure you can think of some on your own.  The point here is that no matter how much anyone wants our policy to be under fire here, we don't have any intentions on changing it because a few packages behave poorly.  > Chris said: "This has been in place for a long time and is well-received by our > users." >  > Why is it well-received? What is so great about it?  Wow.  I just don't even know what to say.  Maybe there are people that have a differing opinion than yourself?  What's so great about allowing anyone on the system to run as many copies of ut2004-ded out of the box just because you happen to want to run *one* on your server?  My point is that any argument you make can have another side to it.  Why bother?  Also, we are getting *way* off the topic of security here and moving into policy, which is not the point of this bug, at all.

Here's the quick and skinny...  Add a new group to limit who can play games.  Quite simply, it is unworkable, as it would require a revision bump to *every* games package in the tree to ensure they all get the new permissions.  I've already stated this, but it seems to be ignored.  Now, a *workable* solution would be to create a *new* group and have the games setgid to *that* group, but it would still require locating the games that are affected, and ensuring that the game runs with that gid, while still restricting usage to members of the games group.

But there's nothing particularly wrong with it either - we do it with lots of programs all the time. What's great is being able to play nethack.

I suspect if you do that it will be an issue that keeps cropping up. It's not a bug with nethack, it's a bug with your policy.

I don't see how, all it would mean is that users would have to remain in the games group (with the security issues this causes, but we would be no worse off than we are now) until all games had been updated.

The reason games aparently have not heard of it is that we who were discussing realize what a large amount of work is required to fix this - and so have not filed bugs until real bugs were aparent.  The gentoo policy causes another related problem: For games that share state or highscore among many player in the fashion of nethack, it is common to share that state over a lan. This breaks in an environment with mixed distros (eg a school). The nethack-group solution will not fix this - because I can still forge the same attack against any other linux/unix flavour (or any other distro) on the same lan. Gentoo's policy also causes problems for people who have nis/ldap enabled on a lan with more than one distro. Ergo, don't mix gentoo with other distros.  To say that this policy is well recieved should mean that it has seen praise IMHO. Has it?

A user can compile a game on their own (there's no 'gcc' group to restrict toolchain use, of course), so it seems like a needless waste of the sysadmin's attention.

Any further attacking of the gentoo games policy really makes no sense right now, it only sets up the games team.

All users in the games group can fiddle with the scores 2.

I think a two-group system might be the most workable, where there is one group users must be in to play games, and another group that the games run sgid as to modify saves and score files and such.    As per filip's comment (#28), it would be best if we used the games group the same way other linux/unix distros do so as not to break inter-distro compatability.  So perhaps we could have the games group be used in the normal way, and create a second group (gamers?) for users to be able to run the games.    Now I understand that this would not be the easiest policy to impliment, but it might be worth doing as a long term solution.  Furthermore, it might not be as hard as version-bumping every package in the tree.  Why not write a helper script that people can run to make the changes?  Similar to the way the python team has python-updater for sweeping changes that break things, perhaps there could be a games-update script that would change the permissions on things in /usr/games/bin and take users out of the games group and put them in the gamers group.  The games eclass could perhaps then be modified print an enotice to run this script if it hasn't already been run.

That would have also minimize the changes, as all files installed and accessed by games would stay in the games group. Of course, as the filesystem just changes IDs and does not really store names, the name does not matter that much, but still it makes things somewhat easier.  And it has the added benefit that in the worst case, after the change (to the group file) no user will have access to games that were not already updated, as the game is accessible only to games and not to gamers. So the admin would have to install the new revision or run some updater to make the games available again, but until then the system is on the safe side and the admin will learn rather soon that some action is required.  The game has to run as one group (requiring gid of file and sgid bit) while access needs to be restricted to another group (at least if we keep that policy). Maybe this can be done by restricting access on the directory instead of the executable? /usr/games is already restricted to the games group (at least on my system), so that should be enough for any game placing its binaries in this tree, as long as you change games to gamers.  Perhaps the same technique could be used for other games as well. Almost all games will reside in /usr/games, or in a directory by themselves that can be restricted as well. Only problem are games that have their binaries in the same dir as non-gaming binaries, like games bundled with some desktop environment or the likes (e.g. kdegames). Those would need some work, probably be placed in a games subdir by themselves and for consistency symlinks placed in the main bin dir. Maybe the eclass could provide some check ensuring access restriction.

With OpenAL splitted to OpenAL and Alut, then many other ebuilds were also updated.

Since a GLSA was released and the game was masked, but we couldn't just close the bug because it is not fixed. Therefore, it was left open but severity was decreased to "enhancement", which pretty much means "no stable package is vulnerable, so this is not a priority anymore, maybe it could be fixed when someone cares enough to write a patch". Now, someone actually wrote a patch.

Also, I *really* dislike the idea of putting out an ebuild that violates the policy we've put in place, and can pretty much guarantee that this wouldn't be accepted, as is.  Rather, a more generalized solution should likely be used and put in the games.eclass, instead of in individual ebuilds.  Otherwise, this whole thing comes crashing down as soon as someone installs any other game from the tree.  Also, not running prepgamesdirs isn't really acceptable.

As it stands now, the sgid proposal (make a private group for games such as nethack which control shared files) clashes with the normal use of the games group (well, normal for Gentoo at least) since only one group can be assigned to the executable. Bones mentioned creating a privileged USER instead of group... which makes sense, but only if nethack doesn't make decisions based on the effective-user (e.g. saved games need to be tied to the "actual" user instead of the suid user, somehow).  If we can get an official say at this point about the right fix, there may be some people in the woodwork annoyed enough about not getting their shot of roguelike to do the actual coding (Andrew's code will probably help, but he's already said he doesn't have the cycles to rewrite games.eclass). ```  [Comment 59](#c59)  Martin von Gagern    2009-01-10 10:32:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #58](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c58)) > As it stands now, the sgid proposal (make a private group for games such > as nethack which control shared files) clashes with the normal use of the > games group (well, normal for Gentoo at least) since only one group can be > assigned to the executable.  As an alternativ to switching from sgid to suid, as you proposed and as would probably involve lots of changes, there is still my suggestion from [comment #36](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c36) to have different groups assigned to directory and binary, so that the binary can be sgid games in the nethack sense, while a suitable parent directory like /usr/games can be access restricted to games in the Gentoo sense.

I agree with others here that the policy Gentoo uses for games is incompatible with all other distros and with what games expect. Gentoo has always assumed that the user/sysadmin is the guy that actually knows what's best for his system, and I think that the current games policy clashes with this idea.  I love the fact that Gentoo gives me the power, and I think most users like Gentoo for exactly that reason. So, in the current case, I think that actually a policy change would be the best solution. We can add a 'gaming' group for restricting access to games. I don't mean to criticize the games devs, I know that they did this with the best intentions, but I think that following the standard behavior of other distros will benefit Gentoo in the long run. It sure is a lot of work to do, and I am volunteering myself to help, but it can also be spread in time, and, as suggested earlier, we could have a script to execute changes for the users.

People voting for option 1 & 3 are voting for keeping the authorization for playing games which is 44+23=67%. People voting for option 2 & 3 are voting for handling the games group like in other distros which is 20+23=43% People voting for option 1 are not bothered by handling the games group like in other distros as long as the authorization for playing games persists.  So clearly, option 3 is the best way to go, starting with renaming the games group to gamers. Handling the new games group like in other distros would be the second phase. However, I don't think Gentoo developers are motivated enough to organize the renaming of the games group in the first place (no offence, but prove me wrong), since this implies: - updating all ebuilds which use the games group *at once* - creating a news item instructing how to rename the games group ```  [Comment 89](#c89)  Martin von Gagern    2014-07-02 10:16:05 UTC  ``` (In reply to Evert from [comment #88](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c88)) > - updating all ebuilds which use the games group *at once*  Modifying the ebuild should go a long way here.  So far games binaries were installed as group games and mode -rwxr-x---. This should change to -rwxr-xr-x for most games but to -rwxr-sr-x for those which need to maintain highscores. So a first step would be modifying gamesperms() to include execute permission for everybody.  Of course, doing this before the user did the migration will open a window where the games become available to everybody. You could add an additional check in that function, see whether the migration has already happened (e.g. whether the gamers group does exist, or the existence of some marker ) and issue a warning and revert to old behavior otherwise.  There might be ebuilds which don't use gamesperms(). Those will install their files with restricted privileges, so users can file bug reports about those we missed but there shouldn't be much of a security problem there. Of course some testing up front to see which packages are likely to be affected wouldn't go amiss.  > - creating a news item instructing how to rename the games group  I guess there should be a script to do the work here: 1. Create gamers group. 2. Change permissions on /usr/games to only allow gamers. 3. Move all members of games group to gamers group, at least on standard shadow auth systems. Users of LDAP and the likes will need manual intervention here. 4. Mass chmod files in /usr/games which belong to games group to become executable by everybody; this avoids having to rebuild everything.  Sure, there should be a news item, but for most people the essence of that should be “run that script and everything will be fine”.  Note that there should imo be no renaming of the group: the GID for the games group should stay the same, since otherwise we'd have to also change the group of all installed games to match the new GID. ```  [Comment 90](#c90)  Martin von Gagern    2014-07-02 10:16:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Martin von Gagern from [comment #89](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c89)) > > - updating all ebuilds which use the games group *at once* > Modifying the ebuild should go a long way here.

The savegame parser is still insecure, yes. It might be a good idea to apply the patch. I'll check if and how upstream dealt with this problem.  However, the vulnerability *has* been fixed by my ebuild bump -- it requires the creation of specially-crafted save files in /var/lib/nethack, and this directory is only writeable by root and the nethack group (which is supposed to be empty).

Fair enough.  I can confirm the shared directory and the record file are not user-writable (assuming the user is not in the nethack group):  $ ls -ld /var/lib/nethack drwxrwx---   3 root     nethack      4096 Feb 20 02:18 /var/lib/nethack $ sudo ls -l /var/lib/nethack/record -rw-rw----   1 root     nethack         0 Feb 20 00:59 record ```  [Comment 100](#c100)  Casey Webster    2015-02-19 17:49:07 UTC  ``` I can confirm this bump fixes the security issue.  The group nethack has no members, the game runs as group nethack and can read and write save and no user can list,edit,create,etc files within /var/lib/nethack.  While this may not change nethacks internal behavior, it does fix the vulnerability as described in the CVE:  "The configuration of NetHack 3.4.3-r1 [...] and earlier on Gentoo Linux allows local users in the games group to modify saved games files to execute arbitrary code via buffer overflows and overwrite arbitrary files via symlink attacks."  Local users can no longer modify saved games and cannot create symlinks in sensitive locations, making the buffer overflow unavailable for exploitation.

I am surprised that one day after the QA team has adopted a new policy, a solution that disregards it is installed.

First of all, as you might not have noticed, I've created the new ebuild revision a month ago -- the referenced policy wasn't in place back then.  Secondly, I don't see any announcement of said policy on gentoo-dev. How is anyone supposed to know about new QA policies if they aren't announced?  However, the new policy makes sense to me. I'll adapt the ebuild accordingly. ```  [Comment 106](#c106)  Ulrich Müller   gentoo-dev  2015-02-20 12:15:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Luis Ressel from [comment #105](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c105)) > This shouldn't come as a surprise.

I'm not sure if hearse should be unmasked.   For those of you who don't know Nethack: Nethack keeps two kinds of save files: Normal save files and so called "bones" files. Both are basically memory dumps with an highly unstable format.  The CVE-2006-1390 vulnerability is about achieving buffer overflows by tampering with save files, so it's not directly applicable to hearse (which is downloading "bones" files from the internet).  However, considering the nethack codebase is quite old and wasn't written with security in mind, it's quite imaginable that similar attacks can be carried out by tampering with bones files. If that's the case, hearse users would be extremly exposed to such attacks.  Even if hearse is unmasked, I'd strongly recommend not to use it. If you want bones sharing, use a public nethack server. ```  [Comment 113](#c113)  Mira Ressel    2015-02-21 00:45:44 UTC  ``` Several people who are quite knowledgeable about the nethack sources confirmed that the bones parser probably contains dozens of vulnerabilities. I could provide examples if someone's interested.  Hearse definitly shouldn't be unmasked. ```  [Comment 114](#c114)  Ulrich Müller   gentoo-dev  2015-02-24 19:35:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Luis Ressel from [comment #113](show_bug.cgi?id=125902#c113)) > Hearse definitly shouldn't be unmasked.  I have filed [bug 541272](show_bug.cgi?id=541272 "RESOLVED FIXED - games-util/hearse has old package.mask entry") for games-util/hearse, so the security team can proceed here with nethack only. ``` |  |
