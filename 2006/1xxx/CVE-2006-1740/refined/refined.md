        "root_cause": "The browser's secure-site indicators (lock icon, site name in the URL field, gold URL field background in Firefox) could be spoofed by first loading a secure site in a pop-up, then changing its location to a different site.",
        "weaknesses": "The \"Entering secure site\" modal warning dialog allows the window location to be changed while the dialog is displayed, causing the secure-browsing indicators from the original site to remain.",
        "impact": "Spoofing of secure-site indicators could mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate secure site, potentially leading to phishing or other attacks.",

        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a web page and trick the user into visiting it and interacting with a link that opens a secure page in a popup, which is then redirected to a non-secure page.

        "root_cause": "When transitioning from a secure to a non-secure page, without clicking a button in the security dialog, the non-secure page incorrectly retains the secure state indicators.",
        "weaknesses": "The security state tracking mechanism in `nsSecureBrowserUIImpl.cpp` does not properly handle overlapping URL loads. Displaying the security warning dialog delays the first load, and if a second URL load is initiated while the dialog is still shown, the security state variables are not updated correctly, leading to a mismatch between the actual security state and the displayed UI elements.",
        "impact": "A non-secure page is incorrectly displayed as a secure page, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other forms of deception where users may enter sensitive information.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by navigating from a secure to an insecure page using a link, while security warnings are enabled. Specifically, by opening a secure site in a new window, and while the 'Entering Secure Site' dialog is open, navigating the window to a non-secure page.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malicious web page that triggers a navigation from a secure to a non-secure page while the 'Entering Secure Site' dialog is displayed. This requires the user to have the \"Warn me when entering secure sites\" preference enabled."
