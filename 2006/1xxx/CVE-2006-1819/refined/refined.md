      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of phpWebSite, specifically within the `loadConfig` function. The `$hub_dir` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include` statement. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files or, in some PHP5 configurations, remote files.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Unsanitized input",
          "Local file inclusion",
           "Remote file inclusion"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server with the permissions of the web server process. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "HTTP GET request"
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file with a malicious value for the `hub_dir` parameter. The attacker needs to know the path to a file on the server, for local file inclusion, or a full share path for remote inclusion."

        "rootCause": "The `hub_dir` parameter in `index.php` is not properly verified before being used in a file inclusion, allowing inclusion of arbitrary local files.",

          "Unsanitized input",
          "Local file inclusion"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information and potentially compromise a vulnerable system by including and executing arbitrary local PHP scripts. On PHP5 systems running on Windows, this can extend to including external scripts on a Windows share.",
        "attackVectors": [
           "HTTP GET request"
        ],
         "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker can exploit this by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file with a malicious value for the `hub_dir` parameter and `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be disabled."
