| [Description](#c0)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-10 10:29:12 UTC  ``` The checkscores() function in scores.c reads in the data from the /var/games/tetris-bsd.scores file without validation. Because gentoo doesnt follow the standard setgid games policy, any user in group games can write whatever data they like to the score file.  The players name is printed into a buffer using sprintf without validation, causing a classic stack overflow. On another occasion, the level is read from the file without validation, which is then used as an offset into an integer stack array and written to. While what's written cant be controlled, this could be enough to modify an ret addr enough to execute arbitrary code read from the score file.  This is not a bug in bsd-games, only gentoo is vulnerable because of our group games policy. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-10 10:29:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 79447](attachment.cgi?id=79447 "sec patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=79447&action=edit "sec patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=79447&action=diff "sec patch")] sec patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-11 14:00:26 UTC  ``` Games team, please advise. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Thierry Carrez (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-02-21 09:49:33 UTC  ``` Late. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tavis Ormandy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-17 06:37:33 UTC  ``` games team give permission to mask until a fix is available ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Chris Gianelloni (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-17 11:06:13 UTC  ``` New ebuild, 2.17-r1 has been added and is stable on x86.  Other arches will need to test and keyword as appropriate.  Sorry for the delay, I'm just now getting back into the swing of bug-fixing. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-19 13:06:52 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Jason Wever (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-03-19 19:14:43 UTC  ``` SPARC'd ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jory A.

Was about to submit a bug with this request and the howto link.  Would you like me to get the ebuild and QT dll digests working? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Don Seiler (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-16 13:19:50 UTC  ``` I pretty much have it done.  However I think you'll need to have the Quicktime dlls added to the win32codecs ebuild.  That win32codecs package is under the domain of the gentoo.  I could also edit up a new win32codecs ebuild to download it separately.  Let me know what you think is best. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-16 13:32:54 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [11136](show_bug.cgi?id=11136 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mplayer CVS Quicktime ebuild") *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-16 13:42:28 UTC  ``` I do not see the use of this, as with mplayer-0.90_rc1-r1 you already have that support ... all you need is the QT codecs.

Perhaps those are set by default by mplayer's Quicktime howto indicated otherwise.  And yes the Quicktime codecs do need to be added win32codecs.  Someone on [bug #11136](show_bug.cgi?id=11136 "RESOLVED FIXED - Mplayer CVS Quicktime ebuild") said they were already in 0.90.1 but my tests indicate otherwise.

# bsd-games: Local privilege escalation in tetris-bsd — GLSA **200603-26**

tetris-bsd is prone to local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-misc/bsd-games** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.17-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.17-r1** |

### Background

bsd-games is a collection of NetBSD games ported to Linux.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
the checkscores() function in scores.c reads in the data from the
/var/games/tetris-bsd.scores file without validation, rendering it
vulnerable to buffer overflows and incompatible with the system used
for managing games on Gentoo Linux. As a result, it cannot be played
securely on systems with multiple users. Please note that this is
probably a Gentoo-specific issue.

### Impact

A local user who is a member of group "games" may be able to modify the
tetris-bsd.scores file to trigger the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of other players.

### Workaround

Do not add untrusted users to the "games" group.

### Resolution

All bsd-games users are advised to update to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-misc/bsd-games-2.17-r1"
```
### References

* [CVE-2006-1539](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1539)

**Release date**
