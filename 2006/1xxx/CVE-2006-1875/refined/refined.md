        "An attacker would need to be able to execute the vulnerable code and potentially supply crafted input to exploit the SQL Injection."
      ],
        "details": "The vulnerability lies within the MDSYS.SDO_LRS_TRIG_INS package, where input parameters 'table_name' and 'column_name' are not properly sanitized. Specifically, a check for single quotes within these parameters fails to properly prevent SQL Injection attacks. This could allow for unauthorized manipulation or extraction of sensitive database information. This vulnerability is found within the Oracle database."
