Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The core issue is that Enova X-Wall ASICs, used for hardware-based hard drive encryption, store the encryption key in clear text within a serial EEPROM. This EEPROM is accessed via the Microwire protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Clear Text Key Storage:** The encryption key is not protected and is stored directly in the EEPROM.
*   **Vulnerable Microwire Bus:** The key is transmitted over the Microwire bus without any protection making it susceptible to sniffing attacks.
*   **Insecure Hardware Token:** The "Secure Key" token, often implemented as a Microchip 93C46 EEPROM on an IEEE 1394 connector, can be easily read and duplicated with readily available programmers.
*   **Bypass of Authentication Layers:** Authentication layers (biometric, 2-factor, etc.) are bypassed because the key is retrieved in clear text before these layers come into play.
*   **Inability to Change Key:** Many products do not allow the user to change the encryption key.
*   **IEEE 1394 Connector Vulnerability:** The "Secure Key" token uses an IEEE 1394 connector which can be damaged when plugged into a firewire port, or when using extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to the encryption key, effectively bypassing all hardware encryption protections. This leads to complete exposure of sensitive data stored on the encrypted hard drive.
*   **Duplication of Hardware Tokens:** "Secure Keys" can be duplicated quickly, allowing unauthorized users access to the encrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** Attackers require physical access to the device or the "Secure Key" hardware token.
*   **EEPROM Reading:** Attackers can read the EEPROM using a serial programmer to extract the encryption key.
*   **Microwire Sniffing:** Attackers can intercept the key from the Microwire bus while the device is accessing it.
*   **Firewire Port Exploitation:**  The token can cause hardware damage if plugged into a Firewire port and also if used with extension cables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to physically access the device or the "Secure Key" token.
*   **Technical Skills/Equipment:** Attacker needs to know how to read and duplicate EEPROMs with a serial programmer and/or capture the data from the Microwire bus, or be able to recognize the IEEE 1394 connector issue.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory notes that the vendor will not be notified due to the fact the design flaw is uncorrectable.
*   The vulnerability affects various vendors utilizing the Enova X-Wall ASICs.
