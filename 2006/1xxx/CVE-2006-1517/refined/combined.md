Download the Proof of Concept[my\_com\_table\_dump\_exploit.c](/rdr.php?fn=vulns/my_com_table_dump_exploit.c)Description ```  ~.oOOo. COM_TABLE_DUMP .oOOo.~ ==============================  - Information Leakage and Arbitrary command execution.  - Summary:  MySQL Server  has an  information leakage flaw if a malicious client  sends a specific forged packet. Moreover some particular input can crash the server by overwriting the stack which could lead to remote server compromise.   .The information Leakage (<=5.0.20, <= 4.0.26, <= 4.1.18, <= 5.1.?)-   Abstract:  An authenticated user could read random memory from MySQL server, by  taking advantage of a non checked packet length.   .The server compromise (<=5.0.20 - yes, only 5.x branch)-   Abstract:   An authenticated user could remotely execute arbitrary commands by  taking advantage of a stack overflow.   A Proof of Concept is Attached for all these issues. Tested on: Debian 3.1 - IA32.  A little Note: To take advantage of these flaws an attacker should have direct access to MySQL server communication layer (port 3306 or unix socket). But if used in conjuction with some web application flaws  (i.e. php code injection) an attacker could use socket programming (i.e. php sockets) to gain access to that layer.  ====================================================  == Description - The Information Leakage (COM_TABLE_DUMP):  Author: Stefano Di Paola Vulnerable: Mysql <= 4.0.26, 4.1.18,5.0.20 Type of Vulnerability: Local/Remote - Information Leakage Tested On :  Debian 3.1 - IA32. Vendor Status: Notified on  April 2006 Fixed: Update to 4.0.27, 4.1.19, 5.0.21, 5.1.10 versions.   COM_TABLE_DUMP, as described in MySQL manual is "used by slave server to get master table"  A deep look on it shows that MySQL server waits for a forged packet in the following way:  packlen  ,0x00  ,0x00  ,0x00  ,COM_TABLE_DUMP(0x13)   and then:    dblen, db_name , tbllen , tblname   the extracted code is: sql/sql_parse.cc: line: ~1589     case COM_TABLE_DUMP:   {     char *db, *tbl_name;     uint db_len= *(uchar*) packet;     uint tbl_len= *(uchar*) (packet + db_len + 1);          statistic_increment(thd->status_var.com_other, &LOCK_status);     thd->enable_slow_log= opt_log_slow_admin_statements;     db= thd->alloc(db_len + tbl_len + 2);     if (!db)     {       my_message(ER_OUT_OF_RESOURCES, ER(ER_OUT_OF_RESOURCES), MYF(0));       break;     }     tbl_name= strmake(db, packet + 1, db_len)+1;     strmake(tbl_name, packet + db_len + 2, tbl_len);       mysql_table_dump(thd, db, tbl_name, -1);     break;    }   Packet should be something like this: 03  00  00  00  13  1  73 2f 1 74  to ask for table 't' on db 's'.  But as you can see there is no check for packet, so if we craft a packet like this:  03  00  00  00  13  len  73  we will get an error response   like this: z^D#42S02Table 's.^D#42S02Table 's.z^D#42S02Table 's.' doesn't exist'NULL'' doesn't ' doesn't exist  depending on len value and memory content.  what happens? Here: tbl_len = *(uchar*) (packet + db_len + 1);  takes some value beyond packet len and then with:  strmake(tbl_name, packet + db_len + 2, tbl_len);  memory content is copied by tbl_len in tbl_name or until it find a '\0'    so when this random name is not found Server will send back an error with some random internal memory content.  This, of course can expose parts of queries and or response executed by some previously logged user.  The Vendor fix:  bugs are fixed in 4.0.27, 4.1.19, 5.0.21, 5.1.10.   ====================================================  - Description - The server compromise (COM_TABLE_DUMP):  Author: Stefano Di Paola Vulnerable: Mysql <= 5.0.20 - yes, only 5.x branch Type of Vulnerability: Local/Remote - Input Validation - Server compromise Tested On :  Debian 3.1 - IA32. Vendor Status: Notified on  April 2006 Fixed: Update to 4.0.27, 4.1.19, 5.0.21, 5.1.10 versions.  With the same previous vulnerability, a malicious (authenticated) user could remotely execute arbitrary commands.  Let's see how:  On sql/sql_base.cc line: ~1090:   TABLE *open_table(THD *thd, TABLE_LIST *table_list, MEM_ROOT *mem_root,                   bool *refresh, uint flags) {   reg1  TABLE *table;   char  key[MAX_DBKEY_LENGTH];   uint  key_length;   char  *alias= table_list->alias;   HASH_SEARCH_STATE state;   DBUG_ENTER("open_table");   DBUG_PRINT("info", ("table_list:%x  thd:%x %s", table_list,thd,table_list->alias));   /* find a unused table in the open table cache */   if (refresh)     *refresh=0;    /* an open table operation needs a lot of the stack space */   if (check_stack_overrun(thd, STACK_MIN_SIZE_FOR_OPEN, (char *)&alias))     return 0;    if (thd->killed)     DBUG_RETURN(0);   key_length= (uint) (strmov(strmov(key, table_list->db)+1,                              table_list->table_name)-key)+1;   int4store(key + key_length, thd->server_id);   int4store(key + key_length + 4, thd->variables.pseudo_thread_id);   By sending a triple of commands,  1. A select with the payload.  2-3. Two COM_TABLE_DUMP packets:  0x03,  0x00,  0x00,  0x00,  0x13,  0x02 , 0x73   that is db_len=2 and tbl_len is memory beyond the packet,  the two 'strmov'   will, as the third COM_TABLE_DUMP packet is received by the server, overwrite a lot of memory,  and a good part of the stack too...  The rest is kind of hacking to get the stack be aligned for jumping to the right address.. so i won't go deep in this technique (a lot of gdb helped very much).   To get this exploit work we need to know one address:  the thread struct address (thd).  We should know table_list address too, but i found mine is always 0x1f548 far from thd,so is automatically computed.  We need these address, because they are overwrited too, and the shellcode depends by  table_list->alias address.  Of course there will be more sofisticated approaches, but, hey, this was done as a Poc not as a ready run-n-crack  program for kiddies. :)   The Vendor fix:  bugs are fixed in 4.0.27, 4.1.19, 5.0.21, 5.1.10.    ============  ==COM_TABLE_DUMP poc :   my_com_table_dump_exploit.c  You can compile :  gcc -Imysql-5.0.19-src/include/ my_com_table_dump_exploit.c  -Lmysql-5.0.19/lib/mysql/ -lmysqlclient -o  my_exploit  and then  my_exploit [-H] [-i] [-t 0xtable-address] [-a 0xthread-address] [[-s socket]|[-h host][-p port]][-x]  -H: this Help; -i: Information leakage exploit (shows the content of MySql Server Memory) -x: shows c/s communication output in hexadecimal -t: hexadecimal table_list struct address (by default we try to find it automatically) -a: hexadecimal thread struct address (look at the error log to see something like: thd=0x8b1b338) -u: mysql username (anonymous too ;) -p: mysql userpass (if you need it) -s: the socket path if is a unix socket -h: hostname or IP address -P: port (default 3306)   Example_1 - Information leakage: my_exploit  -s socketpath -u username -i   Example_2 - Remote Shell on port 2707: my_exploit -h 127.0.0.1 -u username -a 0x8b1f468SolutionMysql released a patch.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MySQL: Information leakage — GLSA **200605-13**

A MySQL server may leak information to unauthorized users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1.19** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1.19**revision >= **4.0.27** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database server.

### Description

The processing of the COM\_TABLE\_DUMP command by a MySQL server fails to
properly validate packets that arrive from the client via a network
socket.

### Impact

By crafting specific malicious packets an attacker could gather
confidential information from the memory of a MySQL server process, for
example results of queries by other users or applications. By using PHP
code injection or similar techniques it would be possible to exploit
this flaw through web applications that use MySQL as a database
backend.

Note that on 5.x versions it is possible to overwrite the stack and
execute arbitrary code with this technique. Users of MySQL 5.x are
urged to upgrade to the latest available version.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version.

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-4.0.27"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular SQL
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2006-0903

    Improper handling of SQL queries containing the NULL character
    allow local users to bypass logging mechanisms.

CVE-2006-1516

    Usernames without a trailing null byte allow remote attackers to
    read portions of memory.

CVE-2006-1517

    A request with an incorrect packet length allows remote attackers
    to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2006-1518

    Specially crafted request packets with invalid length values allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.

The following vulnerability matrix shows which version of MySQL in
which distribution has this problem fixed:

                   woody            sarge            sid
mysql            3.23.49-8.15        n/a             n/a
mysql-dfsg          n/a         4.0.24-10sarge2      n/a

mysql-dfsg-5.0      n/a              n/a           5.0.21-3

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular SQL
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2006-0903

    Improper handling of SQL queries containing the NULL character
    allow local users to bypass logging mechanisms.

CVE-2006-1516

    Usernames without a trailing null byte allow remote attackers to
    read portions of memory.

CVE-2006-1517

    A request with an incorrect packet length allows remote attackers
    to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2006-1518

    Specially crafted request packets with invalid length values allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.

The following vulnerability matrix shows which version of MySQL in
which distribution has this problem fixed:

                   woody            sarge            sid
mysql            3.23.49-8.15        n/a             n/a
mysql-dfsg          n/a         4.0.24-10sarge2      n/a
mysql-dfsg-4.1      n/a         4.1.11a-4sarge3      n/a
mysql-dfsg-5.0      n/a              n/a           5.0.21-3

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

The MySQL packages shipped with Slackware 9.1, 10.0, and 10.1 may possibly leak sensitive information found in uninitialized memory to authenticated users.  This is fixed in the new packages, and was already patched in Slackware 10.2 and -current. Since the vulnerabilities require a valid login and/or access to the database server, the risk is moderate.  Slackware does not provide network access to a MySQL database by default.  More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Fixes that affect Slackware 9.1, 10.0, and 10.1:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1516   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1517   The MySQL packages in Slackware 10.2 and -current have been upgraded to MySQL 4.1.20 (Slackware 10.2) and MySQL 5.0.22 (Slackware -current) to fix an SQL injection vulnerability.  For more details, see the MySQL 4.1.20 release announcement here:   http://lists.mysql.com/announce/364 And the MySQL 5.0.22 release announcement here:   http://lists.mysql.com/announce/365 The CVE entry for this issue can be found here:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2753   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/mysql-4.0.27-i486-1_slack10.1.tgz:   Upgraded to mysql-4.0.27.   This fixes some minor security issues with possible information leakage.   Note that the information leakage bugs require that the attacker have   access to an account on the database.  Also note that by default,   Slackware's rc.mysqld script does *not* allow access to the database   through the outside network (it uses the --skip-networking option).   If you've enabled network access to MySQL, it is a good idea to filter   the port (3306) to prevent access from unauthorized machines.   For more details, see the MySQL 4.0.27 release announcement here:     http://lists.mysql.com/announce/359   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1516     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1517   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+  Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/mysql-4.1.20-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to mysql-4.1.20.  This fixes an SQL injection vulnerability.   For more details, see the MySQL 4.1.20 release announcement here:     http://lists.mysql.com/announce/364   The CVE entry for this issue will be found here:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2753 +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular SQL
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2006-0903

    Improper handling of SQL queries containing the NULL character
    allow local users to bypass logging mechanisms.

CVE-2006-1516

    Usernames without a trailing null byte allow remote attackers to
    read portions of memory.

CVE-2006-1517

    A request with an incorrect packet length allows remote attackers
    to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2006-1518

    Specially crafted request packets with invalid length values allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.

The following vulnerability matrix shows which version of MySQL in
which distribution has this problem fixed:

                   woody            sarge            sid
mysql            3.23.49-8.15        n/a             n/a
mysql-dfsg          n/a         4.0.24-10sarge2      n/a
mysql-dfsg-4.1      n/a         4.1.11a-4sarge3      n/a
mysql-dfsg-5.0      n/a              n/a           5.0.21-3

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.
