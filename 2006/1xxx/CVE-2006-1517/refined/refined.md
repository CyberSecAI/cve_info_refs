{
  "CVE-2006-1517": {
    "Description": "A request with an incorrect packet length allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.",
    "Root cause": "The MySQL server does not properly validate the packet length in the COM_TABLE_DUMP command.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Information leakage",
      "Potential stack overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can read random memory from the MySQL server, potentially exposing queries, responses, and other sensitive data. In some versions, this vulnerability can lead to a stack overflow and arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network socket",
      "Direct access to the MySQL server communication layer (port 3306 or unix socket)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user with the ability to send crafted packets to the MySQL server, or a way to gain access to the MySQL server communication layer (e.g. through web application vulnerabilities)"
  }
}
