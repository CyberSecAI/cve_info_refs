## Shadow Utils useradd utility sets incorrect file permissions

#### Vulnerability Note VU#312692

Original Release Date: 2007-12-14 | Last Revised: 2007-12-14

---

### Overview

The Shadow Utilities contain a vulnerability that may result in new user mailboxes having arbitrary permissions.

### Description

| The Shadow Utilities provide tools to manage user accounts.  When a new mailbox is created using the [useradd](http://linux.die.net/man/8/useradd) utility, the open() function does not receive the expected arguments while O\_CREAT is present. The result of this error is that random permissions are applied to the new mailbox. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local, unprivileged attacker may be able to gain access to newly created mailbox files. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Affected vendors have released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to see the Systems Affected portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors. |

# RHSA-2007:0276 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Low: shadow-utils security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0276)

## Topic

Updated shadow-utils packages that fix a security issue and various bugs
are now available.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

The shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for converting
UNIX password files to the shadow password format, as well as programs for
managing user and group accounts.

A flaw was found in the useradd tool in shadow-utils. A new user's
mailbox, when created, could have random permissions for a short period.
This could allow a local attacker to read or modify the mailbox.
(CVE-2006-1174)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* shadow-utils debuginfo package was empty.
* faillog was unusable on 64-bit systems. It checked every UID from 0 to

the max UID, which was an excessively large number on 64-bit systems.

* typo bug in login.defs file

All users of shadow-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied. Use Red Hat
Network to download and update your packages. To launch the Red Hat
Update Agent, use the following command:

up2date

For information on how to install packages manually, refer to the
following Web page for the System Administration or Customization
guide specific to your system:

| [Description](#c0)  Gareth John    2003-01-06 06:20:20 UTC  ``` The lm_sensors init script which should be in the portage repository is missing  so fails to be installed. Also, the ebuild doesn't complain when installing  this file fails, so this should probably be amended too. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Brandon Low (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-01-08 11:45:12 UTC  ``` oy, this is a leftover from when the whole lm_sensors dir was removed by a errant dev ;-) taken care of. ``` |  |

# shadow: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200606-02**

A security issue in shadow allows a local user to perform certain actions
with escalated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-apps/shadow** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.15-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.15-r2** |

### Background

shadow provides a set of utilities to deal with user accounts.

### Description

When the mailbox is created in useradd, the "open()" function does
not receive the three arguments it expects while O\_CREAT is present,
which leads to random permissions on the created file, before fchmod()
is executed.

### Impact

Depending on the random permissions given to the mailbox file
which is at this time owned by root, a local user may be able to open
this file for reading or writing, or even executing it, maybe as the
root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All shadow users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/shadow-4.0.15-r2"
```
### References

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

shadow-utils security and bug fix update (RHSA-2007-0276)

Original Release Date: June 28, 2007

Last Revised: February 17, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-249

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

shadow-utils is a collection of utilities for handling user accounts,
group
accounts and converting UNIX passwords into shadow password format.

The useradd utility from shadow-utils was found to contain a security
bug.
When useradd created a new user, the new user's mailbox could
temporarily have
permissions that would allow another user to read and/or modify the
mailbox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the name [CVE-2006-1174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1174) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0276.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with shadow-utils installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x, 3.x and 4.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.0 or later to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | CCS/SES 3.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.01, 4.1 | Low | Update to AES 4.2 or later to resolve this issue. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of shadow-utils, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
