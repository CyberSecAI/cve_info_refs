{
  "CVE-2006-1174": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `useradd` utility in Shadow Utilities, when creating a new mailbox, does not receive the expected arguments when `O_CREAT` is present in the `open()` function call. This results in the new mailbox having random permissions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `open()` function call in `useradd` is not correctly handled when creating a new mailbox, causing incorrect (random) permissions to be applied. This is a race condition as the permissions are later corrected via fchmod().",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local, unprivileged attacker may gain unauthorized access to newly created mailbox files. This could include reading, writing, or potentially executing the mailbox file, possibly as the root user.",
       "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability, with the attacker needing the ability to create new user accounts using the useradd utility.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system and must be able to trigger the creation of a new user account using the vulnerable `useradd` utility."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for converting UNIX password files to the shadow password format, as well as programs for managing user and group accounts. A flaw was found in the useradd tool in shadow-utils. A new user's mailbox, when created, could have random permissions for a short period.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The useradd tool in shadow-utils has a race condition that could allow a local attacker to read or modify the mailbox.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "This could allow a local attacker to read or modify the mailbox.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local attacker able to create new user accounts.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with privileges to create new user accounts."
