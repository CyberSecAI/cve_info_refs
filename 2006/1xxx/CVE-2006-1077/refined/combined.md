DESCRIPTION
evoBlog is prone to HTML injection attacks. It is possible for a malicious evoBlog user to inject hostile HTML and script code into the commentary via form fields. This code may be rendered in the browser of a web user who views the commentary of evoBlog.
evoBlog does not adequately filter HTML tags from various fields. This may enable an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into pages that are generated by the evoBlog.
All versions are vulnerable.
EXPLOIT
