# USN-320-1: PHP vulnerabilities

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. A

remote attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks

against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call

phpinfo(). Please note that it is not recommended to publicly expose

phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](/security/CVE-2006-0996))

An information disclosure has been reported in the

html\_entity\_decode() function. A script which uses this function to

process arbitrary user-supplied input could be exploited to expose a

random part of memory, which could potentially reveal sensitive data.

([CVE-2006-1490](/security/CVE-2006-1490))

The wordwrap() function did not sufficiently check the validity of the

'break' argument. An attacker who could control the string passed to

the 'break' parameter could cause a heap overflow; however, this

should not happen in practical applications. ([CVE-2006-1990](/security/CVE-2006-1990))

The substr\_compare() function did not sufficiently check the validity

of the 'offset' argument. A script which passes untrusted user-defined

values to this parameter could be exploited to crash the PHP

interpreter. ([CVE-2006-1991](/security/CVE-2006-1991))

In certain situations, using unset() to delete a hash entry could

cause the deletion of the wrong element, which would leave the

specified variable defined. This could potentially cause information

disclosure in security-relevant operations. ([CVE-2006-3017](/security/CVE-2006-3017))

In certain situations the session module attempted to close a data

file twice, which led to memory corruption. This could potentially be

exploited to crash the PHP interpreter, though that could not be

verified. ([CVE-2006-3018](/security/CVE-2006-3018))

This update also fixes various bugs which allowed local scripts

to bypass open\_basedir and 'safe mode' restrictions by passing special

arguments to tempnam() ([CVE-2006-1494](/security/CVE-2006-1494), [CVE-2006-2660](/security/CVE-2006-2660)), copy()

([CVE-2006-1608](/security/CVE-2006-1608)), the curl module ([CVE-2006-2563](/security/CVE-2006-2563)), or error\_log()

([CVE-2006-3011](/security/CVE-2006-3011)).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* php5-curl
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* php5-cli
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* php5-curl
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* libapache2-mod-php4
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5
* php4-cgi
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5
* php4-cli
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

# PHP 5.1.3. Release Announcement

The PHP development team is proud to announce the release of [PHP 5.1.3](/downloads.php).
This release combines small number of feature enhancements with a significant amount of bug fixes and resolves a number of security issues.
All PHP users are encouraged to upgrade to this release as soon as possible.

The security issues resolved include the following:

* Disallow certain characters in session names.
* Fixed a buffer overflow inside the wordwrap() function.
* Prevent jumps to parent directory via the 2nd parameter of the tempnam() function.
* Enforce safe\_mode for the source parameter of the copy() function.
* Fixed cross-site scripting inside the phpinfo() function.
* Fixed offset/length parameter validation inside the substr\_compare() function.
* Fixed a heap corruption inside the session extension.
* Fixed a bug that would allow variable to survive unset().

The feature enhancements include the following notables:

* The use of the var keyword to declare properties no longer raises a deprecation E\_STRICT.
* FastCGI interface was completely reimplemented.
* Multitude of improvements to the SPL, SimpleXML, GD, CURL and Reflection extensions.
* Support for many additional date formats added to the strtotime() function.
* A number of performance improvements added to the engine and the core extensions.
* Added imap\_savebody() that allows message body to be written to a file.
* Added lchown() and lchgrp() to change user/group ownership of symlinks.
* Upgraded bundled PCRE library to version 6.6

The release also includes over 120 bug fixes with a focus on:

* Make auto\_globals\_jit work without too many INI changes.
* Fixed tiger hash algorithm generating wrong results on big endian platforms.
* Fixed a number of errors in the SOAP extension.
* Fixed recursion handling in the serialize() functionality.
* Make is\_\*() function account of open\_basedir restrictions.
* Fixed a number of crashes in the DOM and PDO extensions.
* Addressed a number of regressions in the strtotime() function.
* Make memory\_limit work in Win32 systems.
* Fixed a deadlock in the sqlite extension caused by the sqlite\_fetch\_column\_types() function.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
