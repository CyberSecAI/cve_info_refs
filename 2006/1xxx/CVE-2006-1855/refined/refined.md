      "root_cause": "A flaw in the threading implementation allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (panic). Additionally,  a flaw existed in the choose_new_parent() function due to obsolete debugging code.",

        "Improper error handling",

        "root_cause": "The `BUG()` call in `choose_new_parent` was based on old sanity checking that was no longer relevant.",
