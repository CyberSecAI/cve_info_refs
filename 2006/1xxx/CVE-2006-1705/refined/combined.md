This note "363848.1  A User with SELECT Object Privilege on Base Tables Can Delete Rows from a View" was available last week to Metalink customers. The note was also displayed in the daily headlines section of the Metalink and sent to subscribers of the daily headline section.  Thats why this information can be assumed as public knowledge and DBAs/Developers which missed the note on Metalink should know this vulnerability in order to avoid / mitigate the risk (if possible) whilst waiting for a patch from Oracle.  After noticing the note, I informed Oracle secalert that releasing such information on Metalink is not a wise idea. Oracle normally criticises individuals and/or companies for releasing information about Oracle vulnerabilities (like David Litchfield from NGSSoftware for releasing information an ever not fixed bug in mod\_plsql gateway). In this case, not only Oracle released detailed information on the vulnerability; they also included the working exploit code on the Metalink.   In an [interview](http://news.com.com/When%2Bsecurity%2Bresearchers%2Bbecome%2Bthe%2Bproblem/2010-1071_3-5807074.html), the Oracle CSO Mary Ann Davidson stated: [Ive known customers to terminate contracts  for releasing exploit code you might get applause from hackers but business will not pay you to slit their throats. With knowledge comes responsibility.](http://news.com.com/When%2Bsecurity%2Bresearchers%2Bbecome%2Bthe%2Bproblem/2010-1071_3-5807074.html)   After my email, Oracle removed the note from Metalink.    Details In Oracle versions (7.3-10.2.0.3) exists an unpatched vulnerability which allows users with “SELECT” only privileges on a base table to insert/update/delete data. The inital vulnerability required the privilege "CREATE VIEW". After a reporting on [Andrew Max Blog](http://andrewmax.blogspot.com/2006/04/yet-another-security-alert.html) it seems that the "CREATE VIEW" privilege is NOT needed. It seems that ALL versions from 7.3 - 10.2.0.3 are affected. I could reproduce the problem on Oracle 8i..   The severity of this problem is critical and can eliminate the entire role concept because in well designed applications there is normally a read-only role for low-privilege users (e.g. reporting or external auditors).    Patch Information Currently there are no patches/workarounds available. According to Oracle secalert Oracle will provide patches in a future critical patch update. This issue is not patched in the April 2006 CPU.   Test case 1 (without the view) The user dbsnmp has only the privilege "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY". dbsnmp normally can't update tables in the data dictionary.

## Oracle views fail to enforce table security settings

#### Vulnerability Note VU#805737

Original Release Date: 2006-05-03 | Last Revised: 2007-01-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Oracle handles views may allow an attacker to modify privileged database information.

### Description

| **Database Views**  A view is a queryable aggregation of data from one or more tables that is stored and maintained. **The Problem**A vulnerability in the way that Oracle handles specially crafted views may allow an attacker to bypass Oracle security settings and modify the underlying tables on which the view is built. Originally, it was believed that an attacker must have the CREATE VIEW privilege and SELECT privileges on certain tables to exploit this vulnerability. However, according to [public sources](http://andrewmax.blogspot.com/2006/04/yet-another-security-alert.html), the CREATE VIEW privilege is not needed. Note that exploit code for this issue is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary SQL statements with elevated privileges. This may allow the attacker to access and modify sensitive information within an Oracle database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply Updates** We believe this issue is addressed in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update for January 2006](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/pdf/cpujan2006.html). |
| --- |

| Until the update for this issue can be applied, the following workarounds may reduce the chances of exploitation.**Use Least Privilege**Where possible, grant users the fewest privileges needed to perform necessary tasks. Adding or removing privileges from roles may impact system functionality. Instead, privileges should be administered on a per-user basis.**Change login credentials for default Oracle accounts**Oracle creates numerous default accounts when it is installed. Upon installation, accounts that are not needed should be disabled and the login credentials for needed accounts should be changed. |
