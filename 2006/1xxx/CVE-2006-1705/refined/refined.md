Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A flaw in how Oracle Database handles views allows users with only "SELECT" privileges on a base table to modify data in that table, effectively bypassing intended security restrictions. This occurs because Oracle does not properly enforce table security settings when data is accessed and modified through a view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Privilege Checks:** The core vulnerability lies in the insufficient privilege checks performed by Oracle when operations (insert, update, delete) are executed through a view. Specifically, the database does not ensure that users have the necessary privileges on the base tables when they interact with the view.
- **Bypassing Read-Only Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows users with read-only privileges to perform write operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Low-privileged users with only "SELECT" privileges can escalate their privileges to modify data in tables they should only be able to read.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can insert, update, and delete data in the base tables.
- **Compromise of Data Integrity:** The ability to modify data without proper authorization could lead to data corruption and loss of integrity.
- **System Compromise:** As demonstrated in a test case, this vulnerability can be used to modify the `SYSTEM` password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability can be exploited by crafting SQL statements that modify data through a view, even when the user only has read access on the underlying table.
- **Specially Crafted Views:** While originally thought that "CREATE VIEW" privilege was needed, it was later found that it wasn't necessary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Access:** Attackers require access to an Oracle database and a user account with "SELECT" privileges on at least one base table.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need to be aware of the vulnerability and its exploit technique.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle Database versions 7.3 through 10.2.0.3 on any platform.
- The vulnerability was initially disclosed by Oracle on Metalink with exploit code but was later removed.
- There were similar vulnerabilities found in earlier Oracle versions.
- Workarounds were initially not available, and the recommended mitigation was to apply updates.
