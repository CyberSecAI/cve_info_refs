Package: passwd, base-config
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch d-i

The debian-installer team has determined that various sensative
information may be leaked into world-readable log files during the
Debian installation process (sarge, etch, sid [1]). This includes:

 - preseeded passwords for root and other users if a preseed file is
   being used for an automated install (via the debconf-seed log file in
   sarge, and the cdebconf database in etch (bug #356845))
 - pppoeconf passwords in the base-config log file (bug #254068)
 - various other information about what software was installed on the
   system, and the configuration of the system

Note that unlike the similar security issues that affected Ubuntu, root
passwords are not leaked into the log files during regular,
non-preseeded installs.

The attached patches to passwd's postinst close these holes for already
installed systems, by chmoding all affected log files to mode 600. There
are two patches, one is against passwd 1:4.0.14-7 from unstable, and one
is against passwd 1:4.0.3-31sarge5 from stable. I've also include a
patch for base-confg in stable to do the same thing[2]. In combination with
installation-report 2.13 (unstable), this will fix the issue in all
circumstances.

Note that passwd is not where this bug originated, and is only being
involved in the fix because there is no better place to put the fix.
Unfortunatly, in systems installed by the sarge installer, some of the
affected log files are not "owned" by any particular package, so the fix
has to go into an unrelated package that is installed/upgraded on every
system.

[1] oldstable may also be vulnerable to the #254068 part of this issue,
    but I have not investigated it.
[2] The passwd fix is needed to fix already installed systems on
    upgrade now, while the base-config fix is needed to secure systems
    installed after the passwd package is accepted into the next stable
    point release.

```
```
Mail exchange between the security team and I a few weeks ago about
a shadow update aimed at fixing the potential leak of sensitive
information (Bug 356939):

">" is Joey Schulze
"> >" was me

> There's an updated shadow package in the security queue, and I
> remember asking for help with this issue, but didn't get a response.
>

(Joey Schulze did attach a diff file, which happened to be the same
than mine...so we confirmed we were talking about the same fix)

So, it is the same.

The problems remains. We have two packages dealing with the same
issue for different situations. base-config has been processed through
proposed-updates....while shadow is waiting in the security team
queue....

In short, (Joey Hess own words) the shadow/passwd fix is needed to fix
already installed systems on upgrade now, while the base-config fix is
needed to secure systems installed after the passwd package is
accepted into the next stable point release.

The best really seems to be uploading the new shadow in
proposed-updates as well and have both processed the same way so that
the next stable release update contains the fixed packages.

Moreover, if we only process shadow through security while base-config
which addresses the same problem is not, we cannot write the security
announcement because the new installations made with the sarge
installer would still have the problem even with the new shadow.

So, the best option is actually to drop the current shadow in the
security team queue while shadow is being processed through
proposed-updates, synced with base-config.

As a consequence, I hereby ask the security team to DROP the processing
of the 4.0.3-31sarge6 version you have.

Stable release team: I'm building a fixed shadow and will upload it to
proposed-updates. It should be included in the next stable update
along with base-config 2.53.10.1

PS: I'm actually not happy of the way we handled this, "we" being the
shadow package maintenance team and especially myself. I should have
worried earlier. Thanks to Frans Pop who kept nagging me about this,
leading to a final discussion on IRC convincing me to change and
upload to p-u. Apologies to others. I certainly have still a lot to
learn when it comes at stable updates and security updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
