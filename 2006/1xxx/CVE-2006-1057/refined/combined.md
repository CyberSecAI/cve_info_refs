The problem is that there is a race condition between the time stat() is run on the file and the time chown() and chmod() are run.  The patch that caused this error is here: <http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gdm2/daemon/slave.c?r1=1.260&r2=1.261>  We don't have a fix yet.

Package        : gdm
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-1057
BugTraq ID     : 17635

A vulnerability has been identified in gdm, a display manager for X,
that could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges by
exploiting a race condition in the handling of the .ICEauthority file.

The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0.8-1sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed in
version 2.14.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gdm package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
