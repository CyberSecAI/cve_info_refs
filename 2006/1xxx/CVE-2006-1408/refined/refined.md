  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1408",
      "root_cause": "The game uses an asynchronous socket, and it does not properly handle packets with zero length or packets larger than 4096 bytes. Additionally, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of compressed packets due to lack of checks on the `comprLength` value.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of zero-length and oversized network packets",
        "Buffer overflow due to missing size checks when decompressing data"
      ],
      "impact": "The socket handling issue results in an endless loop, preventing new players from joining the game and requiring a server restart. The decompression vulnerability causes a crash of the program but is not exploitable for arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a network packet with zero length or greater than 4096 bytes (for the socket issue)",
        "Sending a crafted compressed packet with a large `comprLength` value (for the decompression issue)"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker can send network packets to the game server. No other special capabilities or position is needed."
