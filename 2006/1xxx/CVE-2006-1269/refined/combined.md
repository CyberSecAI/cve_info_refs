| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=183426#c0)  Josh Bressers    2006-02-28 23:21:44 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow bug exists in zoo which is triggered during archive creation.  This issue is borderline a bug as it's really only a problem if someone is creating a zoo archive on a directory full of files controlled by a local attacker.  Here is how to reproduce this issue:  mkdir `perl -e 'print "A"x254'` cd `perl -e 'print "A"x254'` mkdir `perl -e 'print "A"x254'` cd `perl -e 'print "A"x254'` touch feh cd ../.. zoo a arch.zoo `perl -e 'print "A"x254 . "/" . "A"x254 . "/feh"'`   To fix this issue, in parse.c, line 42, Change the line:  strcpy (tempname, fname);  to  strncpy(tempname, fname, LFNAMESIZE);  Please note that there are probably countless other issues similar to this in zoo.  I've not looked for any of them.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=183426#c1)  Nicolas Mailhot    2006-02-28 23:55:53 UTC  ``` This is a dupe of #183109 I take it you prefer your fix to the one proposed there ? (just making sure)  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [183109](show_bug.cgi?id=183109 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - zoo contains exploitable buffer overflows") ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=183426#c2)  Josh Bressers    2006-02-28 23:59:02 UTC  ``` These are two different issues.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=183426#c3)  Nicolas Mailhot    2006-03-04 13:33:45 UTC  ``` I couldn't reproduce it with the current fe zoo I'm pushing a new fe zoo (zoo-2.10-7) using the opensuse package as base (seems a bit cleaner than ours) and your fix Please check the result is ok with you   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=183426#c4)  Josh Bressers    2006-03-05 16:14:08 UTC  ``` I no longer see this behavior in the latest update from -devel (zoo-2.10-8.fc5)  If you've not done so, you may want to alert the other distributions and upstream about this issue (I'm not sure if there is still an upstream though).   ``` |  |

# zoo: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200603-12**

A buffer overflow in zoo may be exploited to execute arbitrary when
creating archives of specially crafted directories and files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/zoo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.10-r2** |

### Background

zoo is a file archiving utility for maintaining collections of
files, written by Rahul Dhesi.

### Description

zoo is vulnerable to a new buffer overflow due to insecure use of
the strcpy() function when trying to create an archive from certain
directories or filenames.

### Impact

An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a user to create
a zoo archive of specially crafted directories and filenames, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running zoo.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All zoo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/zoo-2.10-r2"
```

Now all I get is: bash-2.05a$ man write sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `)' sh: -c: line 1: `(cd /usr/man && (echo ".pl 1100i"; gzip -c -d '/usr/man/man1/write.1.gz'; echo; echo ".pl \n(nlu+10") | nroff -mandoc | )' Error executing formatting or display command. System command (cd /usr/man && (echo ".pl 1100i"; gzip -c -d '/usr/man/man1/write.1.gz'; echo; echo ".pl \n(nlu+10") | nroff -mandoc | ) exited with status 2. No manual entry for write ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-11 12:02:45 UTC  ``` David, could you do a bit more research?  What packages did you merge recently?  We really need more information to track down this bug. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas    2002-01-11 16:33:25 UTC  ``` Looks to me that you are missing nroff  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Lars S. Jensen    2002-01-20 06:50:08 UTC  ``` Version: sys-apps/man-1.5i-r1  after 'nroff -mandoc | ' should there be a '/usr/bin/less -is'.  It is missing the default expantion of MANPAGER:         MANPAGER               If  MANPAGER  is set, its value is used as the name               of the program to use to display the man page.   If               not,  then  PAGER  is  used.  If  that has no value               either, /usr/bin/less -is is used.  Setting "export MANPAGER='/usr/bin/less -is'" and it works!  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-20 10:04:40 UTC  ``` OK.  Was MANAPAGER set in your shell before?  How about PAGER? I'd like to track this down. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Aaron Malone    2002-01-21 18:04:59 UTC  ``` It looks like PAGER needs to be set in /etc/man.conf.  If neither PAGER nor MANPAGER are set in the user's environment, man falls back onto the PAGER setting in /etc/man.conf.  Changing (line 83 on my system):  PAGER  to  PAGER        /usr/bin/less -is  fixes the problem. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-25 23:28:24 UTC  ``` fixed on cvs ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
