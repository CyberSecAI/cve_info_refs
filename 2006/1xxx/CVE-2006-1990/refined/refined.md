Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `wordwrap()` function in PHP did not properly check the validity of the `break` argument, specifically for integer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Overflow:**  If an attacker can control the string passed to the `break` parameter of the `wordwrap()` function, it's possible to trigger a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although the provided text from Ubuntu claims this is not likely to happen in practical application, the vulnerability could theoretically lead to arbitrary code execution, as mentioned in the Gentoo advisory
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Heap overflow can lead to a crash of the PHP interpreter, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting malicious input for the `break` parameter in the `wordwrap()` function.
*   **Input Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the string passed to the `break` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to the `wordwrap()` function:** An attacker needs to interact with an application using the vulnerable `wordwrap()` function in PHP and must be able to influence the value of the `break` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Ubuntu advisory mentions that "this should not happen in practical applications" but the Gentoo advisory indicates potential for arbitrary code execution so that might be incorrect.
*   Multiple sources indicate this is a heap overflow, but the Ubuntu advisory notes that a crash of the PHP interpreter could occur.
*   Red Hat's advisory RHSA-2006:0501 also lists this vulnerability.

The information from the provided content suggests that CVE-2006-1990 is a serious issue that could potentially be exploited to gain control of a system through arbitrary code execution, and cause a denial of service.
