How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-320-1: PHP vulnerabilities

19 July 2006

PHP vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. A

remote attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks

against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call

phpinfo(). Please note that it is not recommended to publicly expose

phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](/security/CVE-2006-0996))

An information disclosure has been reported in the

html\_entity\_decode() function. A script which uses this function to

process arbitrary user-supplied input could be exploited to expose a

random part of memory, which could potentially reveal sensitive data.

([CVE-2006-1490](/security/CVE-2006-1490))

The wordwrap() function did not sufficiently check the validity of the

'break' argument. An attacker who could control the string passed to

the 'break' parameter could cause a heap overflow; however, this

should not happen in practical applications. ([CVE-2006-1990](/security/CVE-2006-1990))

The substr\_compare() function did not sufficiently check the validity

of the 'offset' argument. A script which passes untrusted user-defined

values to this parameter could be exploited to crash the PHP

interpreter. ([CVE-2006-1991](/security/CVE-2006-1991))

In certain situations, using unset() to delete a hash entry could

cause the deletion of the wrong element, which would leave the

specified variable defined. This could potentially cause information

disclosure in security-relevant operations. ([CVE-2006-3017](/security/CVE-2006-3017))

In certain situations the session module attempted to close a data

file twice, which led to memory corruption. This could potentially be

exploited to crash the PHP interpreter, though that could not be

verified. ([CVE-2006-3018](/security/CVE-2006-3018))

This update also fixes various bugs which allowed local scripts

to bypass open\_basedir and 'safe mode' restrictions by passing special

arguments to tempnam() ([CVE-2006-1494](/security/CVE-2006-1494), [CVE-2006-2660](/security/CVE-2006-2660)), copy()

([CVE-2006-1608](/security/CVE-2006-1608)), the curl module ([CVE-2006-2563](/security/CVE-2006-2563)), or error\_log()

([CVE-2006-3011](/security/CVE-2006-3011)).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1
* php5-curl
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1

##### Ubuntu 5.10

* php5-cli
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3
* php5-curl
  -
  5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3

##### Ubuntu 5.04

* libapache2-mod-php4
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5
* php4-cgi
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5
* php4-cli
  -
  4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

php security update (RHSA-2006-0568)

Original Release Date: August 31, 2006

Last Revised: January 8, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-175

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide
Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

PHP was found to contain a flaw in its tempnam() function. A remote
attacker
could potentially take advantage of the resulting directory traversal
vulnerability and create files in arbitrary locations, bypassing the
open\_basedir parameter restrictions. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1494](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1494) to this issue.

A bug was found in PHP's wordwrap() function in how it checked for
integer
overflows. If an attacker could influence what was sent to the
"break"
parameter, a possible heap overflow condition could result. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-1990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1990) to this issue.

Due to a bug found in PHP's zend\_hash\_del() function, a remote
attacker could
possibly force PHP to bypass the variable initialization stage in PHP
scripts
using the unset() PHP function. If the "register\_globals" setting
was
enabled for PHP by default, this would result in a security issue.
However
as Red Hat Enterprise Linux has this disabled by default, it is not
susceptible out of the box. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3017](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3017) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0568.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected php configurations installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.2 Load 126 and prior | Low | Upgrade to CM 2.2 Load 127 or later in the CM 2.2 series or CM 3.1 or later in the CM 3.x series to remove PHP. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Upgrade to IA LX 2.0 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | Upgrade to IA MSS 3.1 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | Upgrade to IA MSS 3.1 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya CCS/SES | 3.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to SES 3.1.2 or later to address this issue. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of php, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available
and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

# RHSA-2006:0501 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. An
attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against
sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo().
(CVE-2006-0996)

The error handling output was found to not properly escape HTML output in
certain cases. An attacker could use this flaw to perform cross-site
scripting attacks against sites where both display\_errors and html\_errors
are enabled. (CVE-2006-0208)

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of
Washington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client
libraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed
version. (CVE-2005-2933)

The wordwrap() PHP function did not properly check for integer overflow in
the handling of the "break" parameter. An attacker who could control the
string passed to the "break" parameter could cause a heap overflow.
(CVE-2006-1990)

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches that resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. To use Red Hat Network,
launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:

up2date

This will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate
RPMs being upgraded on your system.

php security update (RHSA-2006-0501)

Original Release Date: August 17, 2006

Last Revised: October 10, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-160

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

PHP is a general purpose scripting language widely used in World Wide Web
(WWW) pages and applications.

The version of PHP and some of the PHP addons shipped with Red Hat Enterprise
Linux version 2.1 were found to contain security vulnerabilities. The
details of these vulnerabilities are described below.

PHP's phpinfo() routine was found not to correctly validate long strings. As
a result, an attacker could possibly use this as an attack vector for
cross-site scripting attacks against websites that provide
publicly-accessible PHP scripts containing the phpinfo() function. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2006-0996](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0996) to this issue.

In select circumstances, the output of PHP's error handling functions was not
properly formatted HTML. Due to this issue, an attacker could possibly use
this as an attack vector for cross-site scripting attacks against web
sites that have enabled the "display\_errors" and "html\_errors" options in
php.ini. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-0208](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0208) to this issue.

The University of Washington's IMAP server (uw-imap) was found to have a
buffer overflow vulnerability. As the php-imap package is built against a
static version of the c-client libraries (provided by uw-imap), php-imap
needed to be rebuilt against a fixed version of the c-client libraries. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned
the name
[CVE-2005-2933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2933) to this issue.

PHP's wordwrap() routine was found to have issues with integer overflow
checking while processing the "break" parameter. An attacker could possibly
cause a heap overflow if they had control over the string passed to the
"break" parameter. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1990](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1990) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0501.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with php installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 2.2 Load 126 and prior | Low | Upgrade to CM 2.2 Load 127 or later in the CM 2.2 series or CM 3.1 or later in the CM 3.x series to remove PHP. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable
versions of php, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and can
be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g. RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200605-08**

PHP is affected by multiple issues, including a buffer overflow in
wordwrap() which may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on the arm hppa ppc s390 sh sparc x86 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.1.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.1.4**revision >= **4.4.2-r2**revision >= **4.4.3-r1**revision >= **4.4.4-r4**revision >= **4.4.6**>= **4.4.7** |

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on the alpha amd64 ia64 ppc64 architecture |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.1.4-r4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.1.4-r4**revision >= **4.4.2-r6**revision >= **4.4.3-r1**revision >= **4.4.4-r4**revision >= **4.4.6**>= **4.4.7** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were discovered on PHP4 and PHP5 by Infigo,
Tonu Samuel and Maksymilian Arciemowicz. These included a buffer
overflow in the wordwrap() function, restriction bypasses in the copy()
and tempname() functions, a cross-site scripting issue in the phpinfo()
function, a potential crash in the substr\_compare() function and a
memory leak in the non-binary-safe html\_entity\_decode() function.

### Impact

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this point.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose dev-lang/php
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
