{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2006-1522",
    "Root cause": "The kernel's `sys_add_key` function did not validate if the target for a new key was a keyring, rather than a user key, leading to an invalid memory access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of key type during key addition.",
      "Missing check to ensure target for key addition is a keyring, and not a user key."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user could cause a kernel crash (Denial of Service) by attempting to add a key to a normal user key (which is not a keyring).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A local user with the ability to use the keyctl utility."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "Ubuntu": "Ubuntu addressed this issue in their USN-302-1 update.",
    "Red Hat": "Red Hat addressed this issue in their RHSA-2006-0493 errata.",
    "Fedora": "Fedora included a fix for this issue in the kernel update FEDORA-2006-423, which included kernel version 2.6.16-1.2096_FC4.",
    "Patch Information": "The fix involved ensuring that a keyring is actually a keyring before attempting to add another key to it."
