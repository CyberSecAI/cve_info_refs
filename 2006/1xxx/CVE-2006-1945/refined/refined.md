{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of input parameters in AWStats, specifically the 'migrate' parameter and user-supplied input in `awstats.pl`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Code injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the 'migrate' parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary code via a pipe character.",
         "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in `awstats.pl`."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server in the context of the application running the AWStats CGI script if web-based statistics updates are enabled. Additionally, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser due to the XSS vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote code execution via the 'migrate' parameter through the web frontend when statistics updates are enabled.",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS) via malicious user-supplied input in `awstats.pl`."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running AWStats, and either leverage the web-based statistics update feature or provide crafted user input through other web forms. For the remote code execution, the web frontend needs to be enabled, and for XSS the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input."
