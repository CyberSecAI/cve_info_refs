Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-1348, CVE-2006-1347, and CVE-2006-1346, as they relate to gCards version 1.45 and earlier:

**CVE-2006-1347: SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `admin/loginfunction.php` script. User-supplied input for the username is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the `checkAddSlashes` function is used on the username, but it's bypassed by using the username `'or'suntzu'='suntzu'/*` which bypasses the sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the authentication process, log in as an administrator, and gain access to administrative functionalities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can inject SQL code through the username field in the admin login form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to access the login form and craft a malicious SQL injection payload.

**CVE-2006-1346: Directory Traversal Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is in `inc/setLang.php`, where the `setLang` GET parameter is used to specify a language file. The script uses the `$_GET['setLang']` value to construct a path without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The script includes a language file based on user input. It does not adequately validate or sanitize the file path, which leads to an arbitrary local file inclusion vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system through the vulnerable script. This can be used to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker modifies the `setLang` parameter in the URL to point to an arbitrary file on the server. This can be combined with log poisoning.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request containing the malicious file path in the `setLang` parameter.

**CVE-2006-1348: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The XSS vulnerability is related to the directory traversal issue. Specifically, an attacker can inject a javascript payload via the `setLang` parameter, resulting in stored XSS when the page is rendered.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application includes a language file without sanitizing the user-provided value.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker crafts a URL with the `setLang` parameter to include Javascript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft and send a malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit script demonstrates how to leverage these vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be off for successful exploitation.
*   The file inclusion vulnerability can be leveraged with log poisoning to achieve remote command execution.
*   The exploit-db entry confirms these vulnerabilities and provides a proof of concept exploit.
