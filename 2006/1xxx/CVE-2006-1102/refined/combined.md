# Cube: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200603-10**

Cube is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, invalid memory access and remote
client crashes, possibly leading to a Denial of Service or remote code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-fps/cube** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **20050829** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

Cube is an open source first person shooter game engine supporting
multiplayer via LAN or internet.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma reported that Cube is vulnerable to a buffer
overflow in the sgetstr() function (CVE-2006-1100) and that the
sgetstr() and getint() functions fail to verify the length of the
supplied argument, possibly leading to the access of invalid memory
regions (CVE-2006-1101). Furthermore, he discovered that a client
crashes when asked to load specially crafted mapnames (CVE-2006-1102).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running cube. An attacker
could also exploit the other vulnerabilities to crash a Cube client or
server, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

Play solo games or restrict your multiplayer games to trusted
parties.

### Resolution

Upstream stated that there will be no fixed version of Cube, thus
the Gentoo Security Team decided to hardmask Cube for security reasons.
All Cube users are encouraged to uninstall Cube:

```
 # emerge --ask --unmerge games-fps/cube
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Cube is an interesting open source game and engine developed by Wouter
van Oortmerssen (http://strlen.com).
It supports both LAN and Internet multiplayer through its master
server.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
----------------------------
A] sgetstr() buffer-overflow
----------------------------
The game uses an unchecked function for reading the strings from the
incoming data.
The function is sgetstr() located in cube.h:
#define sgetstr() { char \*t = text; do { \*t = getint(p); } while(\*t++); }
The problem, which affects both server and clients, is that this code
copies the input data over the text buffer of size MAXTRANS (5000 bytes)
allowing possible malicious code execution.
------------------------
B] invalid memory access
------------------------
sgetstr(), getint() and the instructions which call them don't check
the correct length of the input data.
In short is possible to force the server or the client to read over the
received data reaching unallocated zones of the memory and so crashing
immediately.
The biggest example in the Cube engine is the SV\_EXT tag used in the
server where is read a 32 bits number from the input data and then is
performed a reading loop:
for(int n = getint(p); n; n--) getint(p);
------------------------------------
C] clients crash through invalid map
------------------------------------
In the Cube engine the players have the possibility to choose a
specific map on which playing, if there is only one player in the
server the map is changed immediately otherwise will be voted.
When a client tries to load an invalid map file it exits immediately
showing the "while reading map: header malformatted" error.
When the map is choosed all the clients add a .ogz extension to the
mapname received from the server and load the file.
The max size of the mapname is 260 bytes and the function which loads
the file uses a secure sprintf() which truncates the input mapname
(.ogz included) when the limit is reached.
Then the loading of the map is not sanitized versus possible directory
traversal exploitations so if an attacker (a player) specifies a
mapname of about 260 bytes he can force any client which will join the
server (due to the voting problem explained previously which limits the
exploitation of this bug) to load any file which is not a valid map and
so they will exit immediately.
As already said the exploitation happens with any new client which
joins the server since the new mapname will remain active in the server
for all the current match.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
