  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1102",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Cube engine handles map loading. Specifically, the client adds a `.ogz` extension to the map name received from the server and loads the resulting file without proper sanitization against directory traversal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
         "Directory traversal vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker, by controlling the map name, can cause a client to attempt to load arbitrary files, leading to a client crash. Although not directly exploitable to arbitrary code execution due to the truncation done by `sprintf`, it leads to a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Attacker must be a player on a Cube server",
         "Attacker can manipulate map names on server"
      ],
       "details": "The Cube engine allows players to select a map. When a map is selected, clients append `.ogz` and load the map from the server. The vulnerability occurs because map loading does not prevent path traversal. A malicious player can set a mapname of 260 bytes to cause the client to exit immediately by trying to load invalid files,  achieving a Denial of Service (DoS). This vulnerability is triggered when new clients join the server since the map name persists for the duration of the match."
