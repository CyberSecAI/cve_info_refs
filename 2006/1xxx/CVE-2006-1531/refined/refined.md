  "CVE-2006-1531": {
    "description": "The vulnerability is related to a crash in Mozilla products when using a specific XUL test case involving listbox/listitem and display: table-cell. Specifically, the issue is triggered during the `OnContentRemoved` notification within the layout engine when a table cell, which is not a direct child of the listbox body, is being removed. The root cause stems from the incorrect handling of frame removals in the listbox body, leading to a double free situation. The `nsListBoxBodyFrame::RemoveChildFrame` function was called on a frame that wasn't a direct child, leading to the destruction of a frame that was still in the frame tree and later use.",
    "vulnerability": "The core vulnerability lies in the incorrect removal of frames within `nsListBoxBodyFrame::OnContentRemoved`, when dealing with elements that are not direct children. The `RemoveChildFrame` was being called, and destroying the frame even if the frame was not a direct child, resulting in a dangling pointer/use-after-free.",
     "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a crash, potentially leading to a denial of service. It could be exploited by crafting a malicious XUL document that triggers this specific scenario.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a crafted XUL testcase that uses listbox, listitem and display: table-cell in a specific way which triggers the flawed logic within the layout engine of mozilla products.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to deliver a crafted XUL document to a vulnerable mozilla application. This could be via a web page or through other means of executing XUL code within the mozilla product. The attacker doesn't need high privileges but would need to be able to get mozilla to render the XUL document."
