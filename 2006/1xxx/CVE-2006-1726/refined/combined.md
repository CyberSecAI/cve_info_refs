## Mozilla JavaScript security bypass vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#968814

Original Release Date: 2006-04-17 | Last Revised: 2006-05-17

---

### Overview

Mozilla products fail to properly enforce security restrictions in JavaScript. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| According to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2006-28](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-28.html):  *The security check in js\_ValueToFunctionObject() can be bypassed by clever use of setTimeout() and the new Firefox 1.5 array method ForEach. shutdown demonstrated how to leverage this into a privilege escalation vulnerability that would allow the installation of malware.* Note that JavaScript must be enabled in order for this vulnerability to exist. JavaScript is enabled by default in the Firefox and Mozilla web browsers, but not in the Mozilla's mail client or Thunderbird. Exploitation can occur by accessing a specially crafted web page with Firefox. If JavaScript is enabled within Mozilla's mail client or Thunderbird, then this issue may be exploitable by opening a specially crafted email. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue is fixed in Firefox [1.5.0.2](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/releases/1.5.0.2.html), Thunderbird [1.5.0.2](http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/releases/1.5.0.2), and SeaMonkey [1.0.1](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/releases/). |
| --- |

| **Disable JavaScript**  For instructions on how to disable JavaScript in Firefox, please refer to the Firefox section of the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Mozilla_Firefox) document. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached patch

[proposed fix](attachment.cgi?id=208546&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=208546&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=323501&attachment=208546)

Clever testcase. I blame the Array extras added for JS1.6 (half-kidding, shaver ;-). Compare the Function case (visible in patch due to fix to use the declared string constant), where if there's no scripted caller, principals is null and the check will fail.
In the js\_ValueTo{Function,Callable}Object case, we don't give up so easily. If the callee's object principals (the callee is Array.forEach) subsume those of the callable, we're ok. So chrome could use setTimeout as this testcase does, and it would work as it should.
I wish eval weren't a universal method, but we can't fix that this time around.

proposed fix
The extra effort to get the principals from the callee scare me here. This means that if you manage to get your hands on a priviledged Array object, you'd be able to do this same exploit. I know that AJAX people are using this stuff, but setTimeout(Array.forEach, ...) feels like a real edge case. If this starts biting people, I'd argue for adding a belt (or is it braces?) to the array extras.

Of course, I mean in addition to getting the principals from the callee.

Minimize the patch by eliminating fp again -- it's a single-use variable. Fix that and r=me.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-28

## Security check of js\_ValueToFunctionObject() can be circumvented

Announced
April 13, 2006
Reporter
shutdown
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.1
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.2

### Description

The security check in js\_ValueToFunctionObject() can be bypassed
by clever use of setTimeout() and the new Firefox 1.5 array method ForEach.
shutdown demonstrated how to leverage this into a privilege escalation
vulnerability that would allow the installation of malware.

This vulnerability was introduced during Firefox 1.5 development,
Firefox 1.0 and Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not affected.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until you upgrade to a fixed version.

### References

Exploit code and details embargoed during the active update period.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
