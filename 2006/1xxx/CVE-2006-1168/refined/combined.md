Debian Security Advisory DSA 1149-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
August 10th, 2006                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ncompress
Vulnerability  : buffer underflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-1168

Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered a missing
boundary check in ncompress, the original Lempel-Ziv compress and
uncompress programs, which allows a specially crafted datastream to
underflow a buffer with attacker controlled data.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-15sarge2.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-15sarge2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ncompress package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated busybox packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
involving broken shared libraries.

A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running BusyBox. (CVE-2006-1168)

The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
packages. (CVE-2011-2716)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the "findfs" command did not recognize Btrfs

partitions. As a consequence, an error message could occur when dumping a
core file. This update adds support for recognizing such partitions so
the problem no longer occurs. (BZ#751927)

* If the "grep" command was used with the "-F" and "-i" options at the

same time, the "-i" option was ignored. As a consequence, the "grep -iF"
command incorrectly performed a case-sensitive search instead of an
insensitive search. A patch has been applied to ensure that the combination
of the "-F" and "-i" options works as expected. (BZ#752134)

* Prior to this update, the msh shell did not support the "set -o pipefail"

command. This update adds support for this command. (BZ#782018)

* Previously, the msh shell could terminate unexpectedly with a

segmentation fault when attempting to execute an empty command as a result
of variable substitution (for example msh -c '$nonexistent\_variable').
With this update, msh has been modified to correctly interpret such
commands and no longer crashes in this scenario. (BZ#809092)

* Previously, the msh shell incorrectly executed empty loops. As a

consequence, msh never exited such a loop even if the loop condition was
false, which could cause scripts using the loop to become unresponsive.
With this update, msh has been modified to execute and exit empty loops
correctly, so that hangs no longer occur. (BZ#752132)

All users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to fix these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

busybox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2012-0308)

Original Release Date: March 19, 2012

Last Revised: February 4, 2015

Number: ASA-2012-117

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number
of system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for
recovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those
involving broken shared libraries.

A buffer underflow flaw was found in the way the uncompress utility of
BusyBox expanded certain archive files compressed using Lempel-Ziv
compression. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted
archive file with uncompress, it could cause BusyBox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
BusyBox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-1168](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-1168.html) to this issue.

The BusyBox DHCP client, udhcpc, did not sufficiently sanitize certain
options provided in DHCP server replies, such as the client hostname. A
malicious DHCP server could send such an option with a specially-crafted
value to a DHCP client. If this option's value was saved on the client
system, and then later insecurely evaluated by a process that assumes the
option is trusted, it could lead to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of that process. Note: udhcpc is not used on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux by default, and no DHCP client script is provided with the busybox
packages. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2716](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2716.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0308.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL5 with affected components/packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services | 5.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Communication Manager | 6.0.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Messaging | 6.2 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0.x, 6.1, 6.1 SP1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1 SP2 or later. |
| Avaya Proactive Contact | 5.0.x | Low | Upgrade to 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya Voice Portal | 5.0.x, 5.1 thru 5.1.2 | Low | Upgrade to Avaya Enterprise Linux for 5.1.3 and 5.1.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2006-1168 | The risk is Low because uncompressing untrusted archive files would constitute non-standard user interaction. |
 CVE-2011-2716 | There is no risk because the BusyBox DHCP client is not used by default. |
## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Aura® Experience Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the EP application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Secure Access Link Gateway | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SAL Gateway application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Avaya Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the VP application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

# ncompress: Buffer Underflow — GLSA **200610-03**

A buffer underflow vulnerability has been reported in ncompress allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/ncompress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.4.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.4.1** |

### Background

ncompress is a suite of utilities to create and extract
Lempel-Ziff-Welch (LZW) compressed archives.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a static buffer
underflow in ncompress.

### Impact

An attacker could create a specially crafted LZW archive, that when
decompressed by a user or automated system would result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user invoking
the utility.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ncompress users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/ncompress-4.2.4.1"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-25 10:12:14 UTC  ``` A missing DHCP option checking / sanitization flaw was reported for multiple DHCP clients.  This flaw may allow DHCP server to trick DHCP clients to set e.g. system hostname to a specially crafted value containing shell special characters.  Various scripts assume that hostname is trusted, which may lead to code execution when hostname is specially crafted.  This issue was tracked in [bug #689832](show_bug.cgi?id=689832 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0997 dhclient: insufficient sanitization of certain DHCP response values") for ISC dhclient ([CVE-2011-0997](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0997)), which also discussed few other affected clients.  This bug is created to track busybox's udhcpc separately.  Upstream bug report: <https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3979>  The busybox version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is not compiled with support for udhcpc.  Version shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 include udhcpc and are affected.  However, udhcpc is not used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-27 11:32:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c0))  > Version shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 include udhcpc and are > affected.  To clarify the "affected" part...  udhcpc makes DHCP options supplied by the DHCP server available to the external script via environment variables.  The script can then configure DHCP options on the system in a platform specific way.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux busybox packages do not provide any such script. Example scripts that are part of the upstream busybox source tarball (examples/udhcp) do not set DHCP hostname on the system.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-07-27 11:33:33 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-17 12:11:44 UTC  ``` Created busybox tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 731347](show_bug.cgi?id=731347 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2716 busybox: udhcpc insufficient checking of DHCP options [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-12-13 13:08:59 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: [2] <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=7280d2017d8075267a12e469983e38277dcf0374>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 03:21:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0308 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0308.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=725364#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 07:16:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0810 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0810.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c0)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-08-09 19:21:31 UTC  ``` Report from Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team:  An audit of ncompress version 4.2.4 uncovered a serious security flaw, this loop in decompress() (~1749, compress42.c) performs no bounds checking, allowing a specially crafted datastream to underflow a .bss buffer with attacker controlled data. Some research reveals that the lzw decompressors from gzip and openbsd (both derived from the same public domain implementation) have already corrected this flaw, however ncompress shipped by (at least) gentoo, debian, fedora and suse seem to still be vulnerable.                while ((cmp_code_int)code >= (cmp_code_int)256)               { /* Generate output characters in reverse order */                   *--stackp = tab_suffixof(code);                   code = tab_prefixof(code);               }  In my test environment I've been able to successfully overwirte .got and .dtors with controlled data. The most simple testcase would be:  $ perl -e 'print "\x1f\x9d\x90","\x01"x"2048"' | compress -d  My suggested fix would be adding  `&& stackp >= htabof(0)` to the loop condition.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c1)  Peter Vrabec    2006-08-11 11:46:22 UTC  ``` fixed in ncompress-4.2.4-45   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-05 10:54:23 UTC  ``` References: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=141728> <http://ncompress.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ncompress/ncompress;a=commitdiff;h=e21aad4a5a3ba0b6c2279b28a80f85b0b226a175>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-17 15:45:49 UTC  ``` This was fixed in ncompress versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux:  <https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-1168.html>  and Fedora.  The fix has not bee applied to busybox yet, which include a copy of the ncompress code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-18 12:45:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c3)) > The fix has not bee applied to busybox yet, which include a copy of the > ncompress code.  Fixed now via: <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/archival/libarchive/decompress_uncompress.c?id=251fc70e9722f931eec23a34030d05ba5f747b0e>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c7)  Murray McAllister    2012-02-03 05:49:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 03:20:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0308 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0308.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=201919#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-20 07:16:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0810 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0810.html>   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-07-25 11:59:32 UTC  ``` Hi there, an audit of ncompress version 4.2.4 uncovered a serious security flaw, this loop in decompress() (~1749, compress42.c) performs no bounds checking, allowing a specially crafted datastream to underflow a .bss buffer with attacker controlled data. Some research reveals that the lzw decompressors from gzip and openbsd (both derived from the same public domain implementation) have already corrected this flaw, however ncompress shipped by (at least) gentoo, debian, fedora and suse seem to still be vulnerable.                 while ((cmp_code_int)code >= (cmp_code_int)256)                { /* Generate output characters in reverse order */                    *--stackp = tab_suffixof(code);                    code = tab_prefixof(code);                }  In my test environment I've been able to successfully overwirte .got and .dtors with controlled data. The most simple testcase would be:  $ perl -e 'print "\x1f\x9d\x90","\x01"x"2048"' | compress -d  My suggested fix would be adding  `&& stackp >= htabof(0)` to the loop condition.  As far as I'm aware, this package is no longer actively maintained by any upstream author. If there are no objections, I'll suggest an embargo date of Tuesday 8th August, 14:00 UTC.  Please credit "Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team" on any advisory relating to this issue.  Thanks, Tavis. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-07-25 12:14:38 UTC  ``` mhh vapier, this looks like something for you. can you provide new ebuilds? thanks in advance ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2006-07-30 15:32:05 UTC  ``` not really ... ncompress was put into the public domain long ago and has since seen no updates and has no upstream  we'll need to fix this ourselves (or steal a fix from another distro) ... pmasking/punting is not an acceptable solution  might also be worth noting that my dev-libs/liblzw package is also vuln as the decompressing code in there is taken straight from ncompress ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tim Yamin (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-07-31 05:35:52 UTC  ``` Mike: We have a fix for this one; I'll attach it here when it's finalized :) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-09 11:42:15 UTC  ``` I think this is public now though I haven't seen any advisories yet. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Stefan Cornelius (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-08-10 00:25:50 UTC  ``` Ok, this is public?

ncompress security update (RHSA-2006-0663)

Original Release Date: Oct 12, 2006

Last Revised: May 28, 2009

Number: ASA-2006-226

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The ncompress package contains file compression and decompression
utilities, which are compatible with the original UNIX compress utility
(.Z
file extensions).

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a lack of bounds
checking in ncompress. An attacker could create a carefully crafted file
that could execute arbitrary code if uncompressed by a victim. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-1168](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1168) to this issue.

In addition, two bugs that affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
ncompress
packages were fixed:

\* The display statistics and compression results in verbose mode were
not
shown when operating on zero length files.

\* An attempt to compress zero length files resulted in an unexpected
return
code.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat
Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0663.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with ncompress installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | Will not be addressed since no further releases of IALX are planned. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
