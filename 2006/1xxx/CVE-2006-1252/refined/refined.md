Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `eval()` on user-controlled input within the `cal.php` file of the Light Weight Calendar application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Eval Injection:** The application directly uses the `eval()` function to execute code based on the `date` parameter from the HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by manipulating the `date` parameter. This allows for complete compromise of the server and application, potentially leading to data breaches, defacement, or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `index.php` script including a malicious payload in the `date` parameter.
- The payload is passed through multiple functions (`calEnter()`, `calOpen()`, `calMain()`, `calLeftSide()`) and ultimately eval'd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
