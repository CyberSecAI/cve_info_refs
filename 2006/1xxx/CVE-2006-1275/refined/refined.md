Root cause of vulnerability:
The GGZ protocol, which is based on XML, is vulnerable to client disconnections due to malformed XML data. There are multiple ways to trigger this issue due to insufficient input sanitization and improper handling of messages:
    1.  Using an apex character (') at the end of a nickname during login.
    2.  Using a nickname longer than 16 characters or containing invalid characters (except the apex at the end), which are replaced by the server with a default nickname.
    3.  Sending long text messages that are truncated by the server's snprintf() function, causing the final XML delimiter "]]>" to be dropped.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insufficient input sanitization: The server does not properly sanitize user-provided nicknames, allowing special characters (apex) to cause issues.
- Inconsistent nickname handling: The server replaces long or invalid nicknames with a default nickname that causes issues with XML parsing on clients.
- snprintf truncation: The server's use of snprintf() with a fixed buffer size leads to truncation of long messages, resulting in missing XML delimiters.
- Lack of XML library: The server does not use a dedicated XML library, leading to custom parsing logic which is prone to errors.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote denial of service: Exploiting the vulnerabilities causes other clients to disconnect from the GGZ server due to malformed XML data.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker needs to connect to the GGZ server and join a room.
- The attacker can then exploit:
  -  Using a nickname with a trailing apex.
  -  Using a long or invalid nickname.
  -  Sending very long text messages.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be a client of the GGZ server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the server, either in form of a nickname during login, or messages sent to other clients in a chatroom.
