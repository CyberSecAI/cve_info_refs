CVE-2006-1173:
```
The provided content describes a vulnerability in Sendmail related to handling malformed multipart MIME messages. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `mime8to7()` function in Sendmail can enter an infinite recursion loop when processing certain malformed multipart MIME messages. This recursion leads to stack exhaustion and process crashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Recursion:** The core vulnerability lies in the way `mime8to7()` parses and processes multipart MIME messages with certain malformed structures causing a stack overflow due to excessive recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted email to trigger the vulnerability. This results in the forked Sendmail process crashing.
- **Queue Processing Halt:** If the Sendmail configuration does not have randomized queue processing, the attack will halt the delivery of all queued emails, including both the malicious message and legitimate ones.
- **Core Dump Flooding:** If core dumps with unique naming schemes (like `core.pid`) are enabled on the system, an attacker can fill up the filesystem with crash dumps.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely by sending a specially crafted email to a vulnerable Sendmail server.
- **Email Delivery:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of received emails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a vulnerable Sendmail server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require authentication; any remote party can send a malformed email.

**Additional Details:**
- Some sources mentioned that incoming emails delivered interactively are not affected.
- Several workarounds are provided, including limiting the max message size, removing stack size limitations, and configuring the mail server to use a random queue processing order and disable core dumps.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Sendmail version 8.13.7.
- Patches were released by multiple vendors, including Gentoo, Red Hat, IBM, and NetBSD.
- Some vendors, like F5 Networks, indicated their products were not vulnerable due to not running sendmail in MTA mode.
