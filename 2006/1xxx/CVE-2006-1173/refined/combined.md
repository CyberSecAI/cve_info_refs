How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Sendmail: Denial of service — GLSA **200606-19**

Faulty multipart MIME messages can cause forked Sendmail processes to
crash.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/sendmail** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **8.13.6-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.13.6-r1** |

### Background

Sendmail is a popular mail transfer agent (MTA).

### Description

Frank Sheiness discovered that the mime8to7() function can recurse
endlessly during the decoding of multipart MIME messages until the
stack of the process is filled and the process crashes.

### Impact

By sending specially crafted multipart MIME messages, a remote
attacker can cause a subprocess forked by Sendmail to crash. If
Sendmail is not set to use a randomized queue processing, the attack
will effectively halt the delivery of queued mails as well as the
malformed one, incoming mail delivered interactively is not affected.
Additionally, on systems where core dumps with an individual naming
scheme (like "core.pid") are enabled, a filesystem may fill up with
core dumps. Core dumps are disabled by default in Gentoo.

### Workaround

The Sendmail 8.13.7 release information offers some workarounds, please
see the Reference below. Note that the issue has actually been fixed in
the 8.13.6-r1 ebuild.

### Resolution

All Sendmail users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/sendmail-8.13.6-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Sendmail fails to handle malformed multipart MIME messages

#### Vulnerability Note VU#146718

Original Release Date: 2006-06-14 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

Sendmail does not properly handle malformed multipart MIME messages. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| **Sendmail**Sendmail is a widely used mail transfer agent (MTA).**Mail Transfer Agents (MTA)**MTAs are responsible for sending and receiving email messages over the internet. They are also referred to as mail servers or SMTP servers.  **The Problem**Sendmail fails to properly handle malformed multipart MIME messages. This vulnerability may be triggered by sending a specially crafted message to a vulnerable Sendmail MTA. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability will not cause the Sendmail server process to terminate. However, it may cause the Sendmail to consume a large amount of system resources. Specifically, if a system writes uniquely named core dump files, this vulnerability may cause available disk space to be filled with core dumps leading to a disruption of system operation resulting in a denial-of-service condition.Additionally, this vulnerability may cause queue runs to abort; if this situation were to occur, processing and delivery of queued messages would be prevented. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade Sendmail**This issue is corrected in Sendmail version [8.13.7](http://www.sendmail.org/releases/8.13.7.html). |
| --- |

| The following workarounds were provided by Sendmail:**Limit message size**Limiting the maximum message size accepted by your server (via the sendmail MaxMessageSize option) will mitigate this vulnerability.**Remove stack size limit**If your operating system limits stack size, remove that limit. This will make the attack more difficult to accomplish, as it will require a very large message. Also, by limiting the maximum message size accepted by your server (via the sendmail MaxMessageSize option), you can eliminate the attack completely.**Configure your MTA to avoid the negative impacts listed above**:     + Disable core dumps. + Enable the ForkEachJob option at the cost of lower queue run performance and potentially a high number of processes. + Set QueueSortOrder to random, which will randomize the order jobs are processed. Note that with random queue sorting, the bad message will still be processed and the queue run aborted every time, but at a different, random spot. |

### [NetBSD](#MIMG-6PMNMS) Affected

Notified:  May 09, 2006  Updated: June 15, 2006

**Statement Date:   June 14, 2006**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

In response to this and previous issues, Sendmail was removed entirely from the NetBSD-current base system on 2006-05-30. The default MTA has been switched to Postfix. These changes will be included in NetBSD 4.0 and later releases in order to minimise the risk and maintenance burden for any future sendmail issues.

Sendmail remains in the base distribution for the presently maintained release branches, NetBSD 2.\* and 3.\*, and fixes for this issue have been applied. Sendmail remains as a supported MTA for users of all NetBSD versions (and many other platforms) via pkgsrc.

Details of these fixes and further advice has been published in NetBSD Security Advisory 2006-017.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

### [Red Hat, Inc.](#MIMG-6PMNPH) Affected

Notified:  May 09, 2006  Updated: June 14, 2006

**Statement Date:   June 14, 2006**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Red Hat distributes Sendmail in all Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases. By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Sendmail is configured to only accept connections from the local host. Therefore, only users who have configured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts would be remotely vulnerable to this denial of service issue.

Updated Sendmail packages will shortly be available along with our advisory at the URL below. At the same time users of the Red Hat Network will be able to update their systems using the 'up2date' tool.

### Vendor Statement

Sidewinder G2 Security Appliance

Not Vulnerable

The standard defensive coding and configuration practices used on the Sidewinder G2 Security Appliance preve
nt this attack from interrupting the flow of mail through the system. In a standard configuration, attack m
essages will be rejected as invalid without causing an abnormal termination of sendmail. Due to the defensi
ve design of the system, even if an attack message were able to cause an instance of sendmail to terminate,
it would not prevent other messages from being delivered.

As a matter of best practices and defense in depth, the sendmail update will be included in a future patch.

Cyberguard Classic & TSP

Not Vulnerable

Cyberguard Class and TSP do not make use of sendmail for mail delivery.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sendmail Open Source

# Sendmail Open Source

## Email Security and Threat Protection

---

The sendmail Sentrion platform is specifically designed for large, complex environments, but we make a subset of that solution available as an open-source offering. Sentrion is not for everyone, but if you are using open source email for a large complex environment and need an enterprise platform that will enable your messaging roadmap for years to come (virtualization, consolidation, cloud migration, etc.), [speak with a specialist](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/contact) to see if Sendmail Sentrion is right for you.

[Frequently Asked Questions](/us/sendmail/faq)

### Current Sendmail Open Source Release

Sendmail [8.18.1](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) is available from [ftp.sendmail.org](https://ftp.sendmail.org/). The release has a [gzipped tar](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz) file and a [PGP signature](https://ftp.sendmail.org/sendmail.8.18.1.tar.gz.sig) file. The compressed/gzipped tar files are [signed](#Signing_Keys) by the [2024 signing key](https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/signing-keys/sendmail2024.asc). See the Security and PGP Signing Keys section for more information about how releases are signed.

### Signing Keys

Security advisories are issued by The Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT](http://www.cert.org/). Sendmail server related security problems should be sent to:

**sendmail-security-*YYYY*@support.sendmail.org**

Replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2015. This address is only for reporting security problems in sendmail. When reporting security problems, please use PGP-the public key is available in the file PGPKEYS of the sendmail distribution.

**Please do not use this address to report problems that are not related to the security of the sendmail server.**Questions about [avoiding spam risk](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-reference/spam), how to set up your own certificate authorities, etc. should be posted in comp.mail.sendmail, and Unix-related security in the comp.security.unix newsgroup.

All sendmail distributions are signed with a PGP key named "Sendmail Signing Key/*YYYY*" where *YYYY* is the year of release.

### Contact Us

These addresses are for contributing patches or reporting problems about V8 sendmail. The members of these lists do not have the resources to support vendor versions. Before sending to any of these addresses, please check the [FAQ](/us/sendmail/faq "Sendmail FAQ") and the files README, sendmail/README (on this web-site as Compiling Sendmail) and cf/README (on this web-site as the Configuration README pages) to see if they are already answered; about half of the questions received can be answered in this way.

**Notes**

* Do not send us mail in HTML format, use plain text only (even multipart/alternative with an HTML part will be classified as spam by some of our members and hence an answer will most likely be delayed).
* Do not use 8bit characters in the Subject: nor use some encoding, e.g., =?GB2312?B?, but only plain 7bit ASCII without any charset encoding.
* If you send e-mail to sendmail.org, the answer will most likely not come from a system in the sendmail.org domain. If you use some anti-spam techniques (e.g., challenge-response systems) or you block hosts that are connected via DSL then please do not expect an answer. More and more often replies are blocked which is very annoying. Do not block this address or make sure that your system accepts at least STARTTLS secured mail. A list of IPs is available in the sendmail.org SPF record.
* If you use a challenge/response system, make sure that it does NOT send us a challenge when we reply to your question or when you receive mail from the announce list. We will not reply to those annoying mails.
* If you are using the blacklist from spamlist.org then please do not send us e-mail, the reply of the sendmail maintainer will not reach you.
* Do not send us mail in proprietary formats.
* The mailservers for support.sendmail.org now (2004-11-24) use the following DNSBLs:
  + sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org
  + dnsbl.sorbs.net
  + list.dsbl.org
  + bl.spamcop.net
* The mailserver for support.sendmail.org performs strict RFC checks, for example, it does not accept mail if the domain part has an [MX record](/us/threat-reference/mx-record "MX Record") that points to an IP address (instead of hostname as required).

If you have a question about sendmail, then please post it to the Usenet group comp.mail.sendmail. This newsgroup is dedicated to sendmail. Please make sure you check the usual resources before posting and follow the netiquette.

E-mail addresses to contact sendmail.org are (do *not* send questions about sendmail to these addresses, see above instead; replace YYYY with the current year, e.g., 2006, in all of these addresses):

* sendmail-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for contributing patches, feature requests, and general comments but not questions how to use, install, or configure sendmail;
* sendmail-bugs-YYYY@support.sendmail.org to report implementation bugs;
* sendmail-faq-YYYY@support.sendmail.org only for comments / questions about the FAQ. Please mark your mail clearly with "FAQ: item" where item is the entry in the faq to which you are referring. If it is a general comment about the FAQ, use "FAQ: general", if it is an addition, use "FAQ: new".
* sendmail-security-YYYY@support.sendmail.org (use this only to report related bugs or problems in sendmail). Please do not use this to ask about problems with your configuration, including how to stop spam, how to set up your own certificate authority, how to make sendmail work with S/MIME, etc. All such questions should be asked in comp.mail.sendmail. Also, please do not tell us that you were able to forge mail by using telnet to connect to port 25; this is fundamental to the Internet design for [SMTP](/us/threat-reference/smtp-relay "SMTP Relay"), and not a sendmail bug. Please use encryption to send mail to this address.
* sendmail-mirror-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for updates about a mirror (e.g., a new mirror or an address change).
* webmaster-YYYY@support.sendmail.org for comments about the website.

These are not open lists, meaning that subscription is by invitation only.

### DKIM

The [Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/corporate-blog/post/what-is-dkim) Internet standard enables email senders to digitally sign their messages so that receivers can verify that those messages have not been forged. The DKIM sender authentication scheme allows the recipient of a message to confirm a message originated with the sender’s domain and that the message content has not been altered. A cryptography-based solution, DKIM provides businesses an industry-standard method for mitigating [email fraud](/us/products/email-protection/email-fraud-defense "Email Fraud Defense") and [protecting an organization’s brand](/us/solutions/digital-risk/digital-brand-protection "Digital Brand Protection") and reputation at a relatively low implementation cost.

DKIM has been approved by the IETF as a draft standard (RFC 4871). The protocol was developed through the cooperation of Sendmail, Cisco Systems and Yahoo!

Since being approved by the IETF, a new open source project was started. The OpenDKIM Project is a community effort to develop and maintain a C library for producing DKIM-aware applications and an open source milter for providing DKIM service.

The project started from a code fork of version 2.8.3 of the open source [dkim-milter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dkim-milter/) package developed and maintained by Sendmail, Inc.

The Sendmail [Sentrion Message Processing Engine](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/email-protection/open-source-email-solution) comes standard with OpenDKIM. More information is available at [opendkim.org](http://opendkim.org/) and [dkim.org](http://dkim.org/)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 1. Overview:

New Sun Alert Notifications from Sun Microsystems have been issued
and are
described below. Issues which have been resolved by Sun Microsystems
have
been indicated as such. Notifications without a resolution may have
restrictions to additional information on the
[sunsolve.sun.com](http://sunsolve.sun.com) website.

**102460**
A Security Vulnerability in sendmail(1M) Versions Prior to 8.13.7
May Allow
a Denial of Service (DoS) To Occur
Product: Solaris 9 Operating System, Solaris 10 Operating System,
Solaris 8
Operating System
Category: Security
Date Released: 14-Jun-2006
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102460-1>

**102461**
Memory Leak in NSS May Cause the System to Hang or Panic

Date Released: 13-Jun-2006
<http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102461-1>

**Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating
System**:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product
when it is
delivered. The Avaya ***Call Management System*** (CMS) and
the
Avaya ***Interactive Response*** (IR) are both shipped with
an
operating system from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be taken on those
products are described below.

**Recommended Actions**:
Follow the recommended actions for
each
notification described below. This advisory will be updated as
additional
information becomes available.

| Sun Advisory: | Affected S/W Version | Risk | Comments or Recommended Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **102460** | IR - All CMS - V9, V11, R12, R13, R13.1 | LowLow | IR - The patch 122856-02 from Sun may be applied to the IR system. CMS V9, V11 - Apply patch 113575-07 or subsequent. CMS R12, R13, R13.1 - Apply patch 113575-07 or subsequent. |
| **102461** | All | None | No action is necessary. IR and CMS do not utilize Sun Java Enterprise System |

**Recommended Actions:**
 To prevent the disruption of the
sendmail(1M)
delivery mechanism, the 'ForkEachJob' option can be set, causing
sendmail to
deliver each message in its own process, preventing any one message
from
disrupting the delivery of other messages. However, this may have an
impact
on the performance of the delivery process.

This option can be set by adding the following line to the \*.mc files
used to
generate the "/etc/mail/sendmail.cf" and "/etc/mail/submit.cf" (if
present)
files:

define(`confSEPARATE\_PROC',`true')dnl

The \*.mc files are located in "/usr/lib/mail/cf" for Solaris 8 and
9.

Generate the new \*.cf files from these revised \*.mc files and copy to
"/etc/mail/sendmail.cf" and "/etc/mail/submit.cf" as required. Please
refer
to "/usr/lib/mail/README" for additional information on how to use
the \*.mc
files.

Restart sendmail once the modifications have been performed, as
follows:

Solaris 8, 9:

# /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
# /etc/init.d/sendmail start

To prevent sendmail(1M) from filling up the disk, it can be
configured using
the coreadm(1M) command to write statically named core files. This
should be
applied to both the global core file pattern (if enabled) and the
per-process
core file pattern.

For example, to disable global core files:

# coreadm -d global

and to make sendmail core dump filenames static until the sendmail
service is
restarted:

# coreadm -p core.%f $(pgrep sendmail)

## 2. Additional Information:

Sendmail's complete advisory may be found here:   http://www.sendmail.com/security/advisories/SA-200605-01.txt.asc  Sendmail has also provided an FAQ about this issue:   http://www.sendmail.com/security/advisories/SA-200605-01/faq.shtml  The CVE entry for this issue may be found here:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1173   Here are the details from the Slackware 10.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/sendmail-8.13.7-i486-1_slack10.2.tgz:   Upgraded to sendmail-8.13.7.   Fixes a potential denial of service problem caused by excessive recursion   leading to stack exhaustion when attempting delivery of a malformed MIME   message.  This crashes sendmail's queue processing daemon, which in turn   can lead to two problems:  depending on the settings, these crashed   processes may create coredumps which could fill a drive partition; and   such a malformed message in the queue will cause queue processing to   cease when the message is reached, causing messages that are later in   the queue to not be processed.
