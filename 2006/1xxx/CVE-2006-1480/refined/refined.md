{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application stores paths in cookies without sanitizing them before including files. This allows an attacker to inject a path to a malicious file through the `skin2` cookie.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper input validation",
    "Remote file inclusion (RFI)",
    "Cookie injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious code into the Apache log files and then including this code via the vulnerable cookie.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious path, including a null byte, into the `skin2` cookie. This path points to a location where the attacker has previously injected PHP code (e.g., via Apache log files). When the application processes this cookie, it includes the attacker's code, leading to remote code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted `skin2` cookie to the vulnerable web application. The magic_quotes_gpc setting in PHP must be Off."
