  "CVE-2006-1942": {
    "description": "Eric Foley discovered that a user can be tricked to expose a local file to a remote attacker by displaying a local file as image in connection with other vulnerabilities.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when a user is tricked into right-clicking a broken image and selecting 'View Image'. Due to the way file paths are processed, a local file can be loaded even if it's not a valid image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of file paths",
      "Lack of sufficient validation for image sources when 'View Image' is selected",
      "Bypassing security restrictions meant to prevent local file access through web content."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could trick a user into opening a local file by disguising it as an image. This could lead to exposing local file contents, launching associated media players for media files, or in a limited manner, causing a denial-of-service by accessing devices instead of files. Arbitrary code execution isn't directly triggered but might happen through the automatic execution of some file types.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web page with a disguised local file as an image source.",
      "Social engineering to convince the user to perform 'View Image'."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a web page. The user must be using a vulnerable browser, be using a Windows system and be convinced to right-click and select 'View Image'."
