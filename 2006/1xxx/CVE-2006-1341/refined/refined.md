**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `month` and `year` parameters in the `events.php` script before they are used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This is because unsanitized user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Modification or deletion of data.
    - Potential compromise of the entire application or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `events.php` script by manipulating the `month` and `year` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- They do not need authentication.
- The server configuration must have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to `off`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" risk, with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available, and a solution exists by upgrading to version 1.1
- The vulnerable software is Maian Events version 1.0.
