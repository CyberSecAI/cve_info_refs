| Yes thats right, there's another bug...Type: quote:  ---  DCC SEND "string" 0 0 0  --- On IRC, in a channel, and certain users of certain netgear products will disconnect.Apparently it works on the 614 and 624 router ranges and apparently some linksys routers too. Its probably to do with the build in firewall/protection. |
