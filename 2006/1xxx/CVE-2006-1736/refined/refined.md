{
  "CVE-2006-1736": {
    "Description": "It is possible to trick users into downloading and saving an executable file via an image that is overlaid by a transparent image link that points to the executable.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation in the 'Save Image As...' functionality, where a transparent image link over a visible image can be used to trick users into downloading an executable instead of an image.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of image type during 'Save Image As...' operation.",
      "Ability to overlay a transparent link over a visible image.",
      "Windows default behavior of hiding file extensions, making it harder to detect executable files."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can trick users into downloading and executing malware by disguising it as an image file. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious webpage which overlays a transparent link to an executable over a visible image. When a user attempts to 'Save Image As', the executable is downloaded instead of the expected image.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious website and convince the user to interact with it. No special capabilities are required beyond basic web development knowledge."
