Gerald Combs reported several vulnerabilities in ethereal, a popular
network traffic analyser.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-1932

    The OID printing routine is susceptible to an off-by-one error.

CVE-2006-1933

     The UMA and BER dissectors could go into an infinite loop.

CVE-2006-1934

    The Network Instruments file code could overrun a buffer.

CVE-2006-1935

    The COPS dissector contains a potential buffer overflow.

CVE-2006-1936

    The telnet dissector contains a buffer overflow.

CVE-2006-1937

    Bugs in the SRVLOC and AIM dissector, and in the statistics
    counter could crash ethereal.

CVE-2006-1938

    Null pointer dereferences in the SMB PIPE dissector and when
    reading a malformed Sniffer capture could crash ethereal.

CVE-2006-1939

    Null pointer dereferences in the ASN.1, GSM SMS, RPC and
    ASN.1-based dissector and an invalid display filter could crash
    ethereal.

CVE-2006-1940

    The SNDCP dissector could cause an unintended abortion.

For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody15.

ethereal security update (RHSA-2006-0420)

Original Release Date: June 30, 2006

Last Revised: September 18, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-128

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Ethereal is a network packet sniffing and packet analyzing
utility.

Ethereal was found to contain several Denial of Service (DoS)
vulnerabilities
in its protocol dissectors. If Ethereal processed a malformed
packet, the
program could crash or stop responding. The Common
Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-1932](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1932),
[CVE-2006-1933](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1933),
[CVE-2006-1937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1937),
[CVE-2006-1938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1938),
[CVE-2006-1939](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1939) and
[CVE-2006-1940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1940) to these issues.

Ethereal was found to contain several buffer overflow vulnerabilities
in
some of its sniffer code as well as its packet dissectors. The
Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2006-1934](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1934),
[CVE-2006-1935](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1935) and
[CVE-2006-1936](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1936) to these issues.

In order for these vulnerabilities to be taken advantage of, an
authenticated
user on the local system would have to start Ethereal (tethereal).
For
Avaya system products, only Avaya Service technicians have
permissions to
run Ethereal (tethereal).

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0420.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with ethereal installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 3.1.3 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1.4 or later. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system.
These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
