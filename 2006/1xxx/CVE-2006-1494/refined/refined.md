{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `tempnam()` function in PHP does not properly validate the second argument against the `open_basedir` restriction, leading to a bypass.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Directory traversal vulnerability",
      "Bypass of security restrictions (open_basedir)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create files in arbitrary locations, potentially leading to various impacts depending on the specific use case. This bypass could cause resource exhaustion (inode exhaustion), leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting the tempnam function with a crafted second argument an attacker can write files outside of the allowed directory.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code and influence the arguments passed to the `tempnam()` function."
