MyBB 1.1 Released

| **[Threaded Mode](showthread.php?mode=threaded&tid=7368&pid=44920#pid44920)**  **MyBB 1.1 Released** |

Today, we're announcing the release of MyBB 1.1.  Initially, we didn't plan to release a bug fix related update until the MyBB 1.2 feature release. Thanks to the efforts of one of our new team members, Michael83, who went through the trouble of patching a few of the more common and annoying problems with 1.0x, we are releasing this update.  This update is also the next newest update in our "security blitz" with MyBB and fixes several known and potential security issues. We're hoping this will be the last in our recent wave of security updates. [imei Security Research](http://myimei.com/security/) is credited for the discovery of a few of these security related issues.  This release also includes some small changes to the search functionality of MyBB, ensuring that it should run on larger sites without too many issues. Functionality remains the same, but these changes are temporary until the release of 1.2, which contains [updated searching capabilities](http://www.surfionline.com/archives/2006/02/26/recently-with-mybb/) (including a huge boost in performance over this version)  As this release is essentially a security based release, we recommend everyone update their boards as soon as possible.  We won't be providing manual code changes for this release (sorry), because of the number of code changes. For anyone who runs a customized board (code modifications), I'll be writing a small article on my advice for updating.  Update instructions are in the next post, including a list of changed files (and a ZIP archive of them). The MyBB website has also been updated.

If you are running MyBB 1.0 Final or later, you do not need to run any upgrade scripts for this version.  If you are running an earlier version, you need to run the upgrade script making sure you select your previous version.  If you are unsure, access the upgrade script and see if your version is listed - if it is, run it.  Will I lose my themes/templates/plugins or custom languages? No.  This release is strictly a code base update. It does not modify or alter the language files, database structure, themes, templates or plugins at all.  If you have any custom code modifications in place and you override the file, you will lose those changes.  I accidently overwrote inc/config.php You can re-create it using the following template: ``` <?php /* Database Configuration */ $config['dbtype'] = "mysql"; $config['hostname'] = "localhost"; // Change to your MySQL server name $config['username'] = "username"; // Change to your MySQL username $config['password'] = "password"; // Change to your MySQL password $config['database'] = "database"; // Change to your MySQL database name $config['table_prefix'] = "mybb_"; // Change to your table prefix, if not using the default  /* Admin CP URL */ $config['admindir'] = "admin";  /* Datacache Configuration */ /* files = Stores datacache in files inside /inc/cache/ (Must be writable)*/ /* db = Stores datacache in the database*/ $config['cachestore'] = "db"; ?> ``` If you also overwrote your settings.php, then you can rebuild it when you login to the Admin CP.
