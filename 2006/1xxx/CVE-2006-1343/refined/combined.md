How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     :

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-0038

    "Solar Designer" discovered that arithmetic computations in netfilter's
    do_replace() function can lead to a buffer overflow and the execution of
    arbitrary code. However, the operation requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges,
    which is only an issue in virtualization systems or fine grained access
    control systems.

CVE-2006-0039

    "Solar Designer" discovered a race condition in netfilter's
    do_add_counters() function, which allows information disclosure of
    kernel memory by exploiting a race condition. Like CVE-2006-0038,
    it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.

CVE-2006-0741

    Intel EM64T systems were discovered to be susceptible to a local
    DoS due to an endless recursive fault related to a bad ELF entry
    address.

CVE-2006-0742

    incorrectly declared die_if_kernel() function as "does never
    return" which could be exploited by a local attacker resulting in
    a kernel crash.

CVE-2006-1056

    AMD64 machines (and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD
    processors) were found to be vulnerable to sensitive information
    leakage, due to how they handle saving and restoring the FOP, FIP,
    and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is
    pending. This allows a process to determine portions of the state
    of floating point instructions of other processes.

CVE-2006-1242

    Marco Ivaldi discovered that there was an unintended information
    disclosure allowing remote attackers to bypass protections against
    Idle Scans (nmap -sI) by abusing the ID field of IP packets and
    bypassing the zero IP ID in DF packet countermeasure. This was a
    result of the ip_push_pending_frames function improperly
    incremented the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving
    unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets.

CVE-2006-1343

    Pavel Kankovsky reported the existance of a potential information leak
    resulting from the failure to initialize sin.sin_zero in the IPv4 socket
    code.

CVE-2006-1368

    Shaun Tancheff discovered a buffer overflow (boundry condition
    error) in the USB Gadget RNDIS implementation allowing remote
    attackers to cause a DoS. While creating a reply message, the
    driver allocated memory for the reply data, but not for the reply
    structure. The kernel fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied
    data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory
    buffer. Attackers could crash the system, or possibly execute
    arbitrary machine code.

CVE-2006-1524

    Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the madvise_remove() function wherein
    file and mmap restrictions are not followed, allowing local users to
    bypass IPC permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with
    zeroes.

CVE-2006-1525

    Alexandra Kossovsky reported a NULL pointer dereference condition in
    ip_route_input() that can be triggered by a local user by requesting
    a route for a multicast IP address, resulting in a denial of service
    (panic).

CVE-2006-1857

    Vlad Yasevich reported a data validation issue in the SCTP subsystem
    that may allow a remote user to overflow a buffer using a badly formatted
    HB-ACK chunk, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2006-1858

    Vlad Yasevich reported a bug in the bounds checking code in the SCTP
    subsystem that may allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service
    attack when rounded parameter lengths are used to calculate parameter
    lengths instead of the actual values.

CVE-2006-1864

    Mark Mosely discovered that chroots residing on an SMB share can be
    escaped with specially crafted "cd" sequences.

CVE-2006-2271

    The "Mu security team" discovered that carefully crafted ECNE chunks can
    cause a kernel crash by accessing incorrect state stable entries in the
    SCTP networking subsystem, which allows denial of service.

CVE-2006-2272

    The "Mu security team" discovered that fragmented SCTP control
    chunks can trigger kernel panics, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.

CVE-2006-2274

    It was discovered that SCTP packets with two initial bundled data
    packets can lead to infinite recursion, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     Source                      2.4.27-10sarge3
     Alpha architecture          2.4.27-10sarge3
     ARM architecture            2.4.27-2sarge3
     Intel IA-32 architecture    2.4.27-10sarge3
     Intel IA-64 architecture    2.4.27-10sarge3
     Motorola 680x0 architecture 2.4.27-3sarge3
     Big endian MIPS             2.4.27-10.sarge3.040815-1
     Little endian MIPS          2.4.27-10.sarge3.040815-1
     PowerPC architecture        2.4.27-10sarge3
     IBM S/390 architecture      2.4.27-2sarge3
     Sun Sparc architecture      2.4.27-9sarge3

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     fai-kernels                 1.9.1sarge2
     kernel-image-2.4.27-speakup 2.4.27-1.1sarge2
     mindi-kernel                2.4.27-2sarge2
     systemimager                3.2.3-6sarge2

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

Updated kernel packages available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update
4
(RHSA-2006-0575)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-200

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* A flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the ACL handling of nfsd that allowed a remote user to
  bypass ACLs
  for readonly mounted NFS file systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter handling that allowed a local user with
  CAP\_NET\_ADMIN rights to cause a buffer overflow.
* A flaw in the IBM S/390 and IBM zSeries strnlen\_user() function that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or to retrieve
  random kernel data.
* A flaw in the keyctl functions that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial of service (crash) or to read sensitive kernel memory
* A flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Itanium processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* A flaw in SELinux ptrace logic that allowed a local user with ptrace
  permissions to change the tracer SID to a SID of another process
* An info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that allowed a
  local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process run by
  a
  different user.
* A flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall.
* A minor info leak in socket option handling in the network code.
* A flaw in the HB-ACK chunk handling of SCTP that allowed a remote
  user to
  cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the SCTP implementation that allowed a remote user to
  cause a
  denial of service (deadlock).
* A flaw in the socket buffer handling that allowed a remote user to
  cause
  a denial of service (panic).
* A flaw in the signal handling access checking on PowerPC that
  allowed a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or read arbitrary kernel
  memory on 64-bit systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter SCTP module when receiving a chunkless
  packet
  that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* There were several bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The
  ongoing
  effort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement
  in the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

Updated kernel packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 8
(RHSA-2006-0437)

Original Release Date: September 15, 2006

Last Revised: September 15, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-180

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 3. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a local
  user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* a flaw in the exec() handling of multi-threaded tasks using
  ptrace()
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (hang of
  a user
  process)
* a difference in "sysretq" operation of EM64T (as opposed to
  Opteron)
  processors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
  (crash)
  upon return from certain system calls
* a flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Intel Itanium
  processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* an info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that
  allowed a local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process
  run by a
  different user
* a flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote
  user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall
* a minor info leak in socket option handling in the network
  code
* a flaw in IPv4 netfilter handling for the unlikely use of
  SNMP NAT
  processing that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of
  service (crash)
  or potential memory corruption

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2005-3055](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3055),

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject:    BUG: Small information leak in SO_ORIGINAL_DST (2.4 and 2.6) and
From:       ["Pavel Kankovsky" <peak () argo ! troja ! mff ! cuni ! cz>](?a=93041729100001&r=1&w=2)

Message-ID: [20060304135316.11348.qmail () paddy ! troja ! mff ! cuni ! cz](?i=20060304135316.11348.qmail%20()%20paddy%20!%20troja%20!%20mff%20!%20cuni%20!%20cz)
[Download RAW [message](?l=linux-netdev&m=114148078223594&q=mbox) or [body](?l=linux-netdev&m=114148078223594&q=raw)]

It appears sockaddr_in.sin_zero is not zeroed during certain operations
returning IPv4 socket names, namely:

- getsockopt(...SO_ORIGINAL_DST...) (2.4 and 2.6)
  see getorigdst() in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c
  (+ in net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c in 2.6?!)

- getsockname() and getpeername() (and accept()) (2.4 only)
  see inet_getname() in net/ipv4/af_inet.c

and several unitialized bytes of kernel stack (sizeof(sin_zero) == 6
to be precise) leak to the userspace.

This *might* have some security ramification.

The former problem can be found both in 2.4 and 2.6 (even the latest
releases according to a "visual check" of the source code in GIT), the
latter has been fixed in 2.6 but the fix has never made it back to 2.4.

A small patch for 2.4 fixing the problem is enclosed. Its first part
(fixing net/ipv4/af_inet.c) is identical to the change made in 2.6.
The other part should work on 2.6 as well but I am not sure whether one
should patch getorigdst() in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c, in
net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_conntrack_l3proto_ipv4.c or in both files. I do
not want to teach you how to write your code, guys, but I think it's
the right time to clean it up. ;)

The presence of the bug can be checked with the enclosed test program
(bug.c). Run it with a single argument denoting the TCP port number
(e.g. "./bug 1234"), connect to that port, and the program will dump
sockaddr_in returned by accept() (== getpeername()), getsockname()
and getsockopt(...SO_ORIGINAL_DST...) respectively.

The results from a buggy 2.4 (all messed up):
