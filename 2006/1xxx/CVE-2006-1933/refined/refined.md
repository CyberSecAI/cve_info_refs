    "Description": "The UMA and BER dissectors could go into an infinite loop.",
    "Root cause": "Malformed network packets could cause the UMA and BER protocol dissectors to enter an infinite loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability in protocol dissectors"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The program could crash or stop responding.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a malformed network packet with Ethereal (tethereal).",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to send a malformed packet to be processed by the vulnerable dissectors in Ethereal, which could potentially be done remotely or locally depending on network capture."
