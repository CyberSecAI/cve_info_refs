      "content": "The provided document from docs.microsoft.com directly addresses CVE-2006-1185.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability is due to how Internet Explorer handles specially crafted and invalid HTML. When parsing this malformed HTML, Internet Explorer may corrupt system memory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper handling of malformed HTML leading to memory corruption\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Remote code execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.\n- Complete control of the affected system: Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a malicious website with specially crafted HTML. The attacker needs to persuade the victim to visit the site (e.g., by clicking on a link in an email or instant message). Malicious content can be injected into websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements. Compromised websites can also be used.\n- Potentially through HTML email: Although, the vulnerability would not be automatically triggered by simply previewing an email.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a legitimate one.\n- Requires the user to be logged on and visit the malicious site.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The vulnerability does not affect Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows XP Service Pack 1, Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), or Windows Millennium Edition (ME).",
