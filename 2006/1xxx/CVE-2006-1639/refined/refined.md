Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `wpBlog` script.
*   The `postid` parameter in the `index.php` script is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary SQL code through the unsanitized `postid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This allows them to:
    *   Read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify or delete data.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the system depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious SQL injection in the `postid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker must know (or be able to guess) the location of the `wpBlog` installation and the structure of the URL.
*   The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be turned off, since it adds slashes to potentially harmful characters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit example shows a typical `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique.
*   The vulnerability is reported as "Unpatched" and no solution is available, indicating the software is likely no longer maintained.
*   The risk level is considered "medium".
*   The vulnerable software is identified as `wpBlog` version 0.4, available at `http://www.wireplastik.com/`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu from eVuln.com.
