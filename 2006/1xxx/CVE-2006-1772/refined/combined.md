How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: mnogosearch-common
Version: 3.2.31-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security

The Debian configuration tool (debconf) asks for the database
administrator password when configuring mnogosearch, and then
stores the password in clear text in the world-readable file
/var/cache/debconf/config.dat under the key
mnogosearch-common/database_admin_pass instead of using the
restricted access file /var/cache/debconf/passwords.dat

Hi,

You should have recently received (or will soon receive) an e-mail
telling you that I've closed Debian bug #361775 in the mnogosearch-common
package, which you reported.

Due to the fact that the package was uploaded by someone who does not
normally do so, the bug was marked as "fixed" rather than closed.

Debian's bug tracking system now allows for this information to be
recorded in a more useful manner, enabling these bugs to be closed.

Due to the volume of bugs affected by this change, we are unfortunately
not sending individualized explanations for each bug. If you have
questions about the fix for your particular bug or about this email,
please contact me directly or follow up to the bug report in the Debian
BTS.

[It's possible you may receive multiple messages stating that the bug
was fixed in several different versions of the package. There are two
common reasons for this:

  - the bug was fixed in one version but subsequently found to exist
    in a later version

  - the bug existed in multiple distributions (for instance, "unstable"
    and "stable") and was thus fixed in a separate upload to each
    distribution
]

Regards,

Adam

```

# CVE-2006-1772

| **Name** | CVE-2006-1772 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | debconf in Debian GNU/Linux, when configuring mnogosearch in the mnogosearch-common 3.2.31-1 package, uses the world-readable config.dat file instead of the restricted passwords.dat for storing the cleartext database administrator password in the mnogosearch-common/database\_admin\_pass record, which allows local users to view the password. |
