  "CVE-2006-1741": {
    "description": "shutdown discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to suspend an event handler while a new page is being loaded. This could be used to steal confidential information.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because Mozilla fails to stop event handlers in the previous page when loading a new page if the event handler shows a modal dialog. The handler's execution is suspended, and Mozilla continues to load the new page. If the user closes the modal dialog after the new page has loaded, the handler continues its execution within the context of the new page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The browser does not properly terminate event handlers when a new page is loaded if a modal dialog is displayed. This allows the handler to resume in the context of the new page."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page on another site. This could lead to the theft of confidential information, including passwords and cookies, which could then allow the attacker to impersonate the victim on that site.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage can trigger this vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page that exploits this vulnerability, by triggering an event handler that displays a modal dialog when a new page is being loaded."
