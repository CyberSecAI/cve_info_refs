      "source": "aluigi.altervista.org_d2e9b7f9_20250126_000623.html",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Alien Arena 2006 Gold Edition <= 5.00",
        "weaknesses": [
          "A] Format string vulnerability in the `safe_cprintf` server function.",
          "B] Buffer overflow in the `Cmd_Say_f` server function.",
          "C] Crash vulnerability in the `Com_sprintf` function due to missing NULL byte termination."
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution on the server via format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Denial of service by crashing clients and servers due to `Com_sprintf` vulnerability.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "A] Sending specially crafted messages to the server to trigger the format string vulnerability.",
           "B] Sending overly long chat messages to the server, triggering a buffer overflow.",
          "C] Joining the game with a long skin, weapon, or model name that can crash the client and potentially the server. This is triggered when the client's information is loaded into the server. "

        "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be an in-game client, not banned, and know the server password if applicable. For the `Com_sprintf` crash, an attacker can simply join the server with a long name, or an existing player can change their skin/model to trigger the crash on other clients."
