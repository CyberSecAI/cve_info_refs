TalentSoft Web+Shop Path Disclosure
Software: Web+Shop
Version: 5.3.6
Website: http://www.webplus.com
Bug: path disclosure
Exploitation: Remote
Description:
Web+Shop is a user-friendly e-commerce shopping cart application for the web.
Vulnerability:
Web+Shop installation path can be disclosed by sending a specially crafted URL.
Example:
http://host/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?script=/webpshop/store.wml&storeid='
which returns:
Web+ Error Message:
Error Code = 10220: Script file error. Occurred in WebInclude around line(169) in Script File
C:webplusscriptwebpshopscriptinitial.wml
Explanation:
The script file could not be executed because it could not be found or is corrupt..
Troubleshooting Information
Check the logical and physical paths for 'C:Inetpubwwwrootwebpshopstore\_'templatesfpheader.wml' and make sure that it is in the right directory. Also verify the file's integrity.
Solution:
Quote from the vendor's replay:
"Path Disclosure Issue: We are constantly working on improving the security of our products. Our next build of Web+ 6.0 will have a configuration that will allow administrators to disable the display of file and path information from its error messages. Currently all other server information can be turned on and off using the Web+ Server Manager.
One thing to note that may help with your particular issue is this: Web+ has a security feature where an administrator can configure which URL Web+ should redirect to if an error 10220 (Script File Error) is encountered. To configure this, go to the Web+ Server Manager (http://host/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?script=/admin/admin.wml). The password needed is the one configured when Web+ was installed.
Click on Logging/Debugging and enter the desired "error" URL in the field, 'Redirect URL for "Script Not Found" Error:'. Then click Apply.
After this is set, any error 10220 will automatically redirect to this target URL. This may eliminate the particular path disclosure issue you identified."
