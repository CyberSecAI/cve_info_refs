  "CVE-2006-1103": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sauerbraten engine.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "A] sgetstr() buffer-overflow: The `sgetstr()` function in `shared/cube.h` copies input data into a fixed-size buffer (`text` of size `MAXTRANS`, 5000 bytes) without checking the input length. This allows for a buffer overflow if the input string exceeds the buffer's capacity.",
        "B] invalid memory access: `sgetstr()`, `getint()`, and calling instructions do not validate the length of input data, enabling reading beyond allocated memory.",
        "C] clients crash through invalid map: Clients attempt to load maps specified by the server by appending '.ogz' to the map name, without sanitizing directory traversals. An attacker can specify a long map name (~260 bytes) with directory traversal sequences to force a client to load an arbitrary file, causing a crash.",
         "D] crash through unconnected client: The server attempts to access client data after a timeout, even if the client has not fully connected, leading to an invalid memory access."
      ],
      "impact": "A] Possible malicious code execution due to buffer overflow. B] Server or client crashes due to out-of-bounds memory access. C] Client crashes when attempting to load an invalid map file, which is also used to make a client attempt to load an arbitrary file. D] Server crash due to accessing unallocated memory.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A] Sending a specially crafted string to the server/client via network, exceeding buffer size.",
        "B] Providing malformed input data that exceeds expected length.",
        "C] Specifying a crafted map name that exploits path traversal",
        "D] Causing client connection timeouts."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "A] Remote attacker can control the input data sent to the server/client.",
         "B] Remote attacker can control the input data sent to the server/client.",
         "C]  Any player can control the map name sent to other clients.",
         "D]  Any remote client can cause a timeout."
