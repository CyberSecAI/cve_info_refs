    "ID": "CVE-2006-1291",
    "Content": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in PHP iCalendar version 2.21, specifically within the 'publish.ical.php' script. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution due to insufficient protection of the 'calendars/' directory, which permits arbitrary file uploads via the PUT method.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication and access control on the 'calendars/' directory, combined with improper handling of uploaded filenames.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Unprotected WebDAV style file uploads (PUT method) to 'calendars/' directory.",
      "Filename manipulation using a null byte to bypass the .ics extension requirement and upload PHP files.",
	   "Lack of input sanitization of uploaded file names."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP PUT request to upload a malicious PHP file.",
      "Sending a HTTP GET request to execute the malicious PHP file.",
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable PHP iCalendar installation. No prior authentication is needed."
