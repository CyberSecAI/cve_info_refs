  ## vBulletin 3.5.4 Released

  Tue 21 Feb '06, 7:08am

  **vBulletin 3.5.4**

  This release of vBulletin addresses a minor cross-site scripting flaw discovered by [imei addmimistrator](http://myimei.com/security/), fixes numerous bugs and adds a few new features.

  **New Feature: Enhanced File Diagnostics**

  In previous versions of vBulletin, the 'Suspect File Versions' system (AdminCP > Maintenance > Diagnostics > Suspect File Versions) performed a check on each file found to ensure that its stated version matched the currently-installed version of vBulletin. Therefore, a 3.5.2 version of forumdisplay.php would be flagged for attention on a board running 3.5.3.

  The new and improved suspect file versions system extends the file checking functionality in the following ways:
  1. **File version mismatch:**

     The system still checks for mismatched versions
  2. **File not found:**

     The system will identify any missing files
  3. **File not recognised:**

     It will also flag any script files in vBulletin directories that are **not** part of vBulletin
  4. **Unexpected file contents:**

     The final and most important check is that on download, MD5 sums are generated for every script file in the downloaded package. The system will now compare the original MD5 sum of each file with its current MD5 sum, so it is now possible to tell instantly if any files have been modified from their original state, making it very simple to see if hacks have been installed or if files have not been uploaded correctly.![](http://files.vbulletin.com/images/anncimg/suspect-files.png)

  **New Feature: SkypeWeb Integration**

  SkypeWeb allows the online status of Skype users to be viewed on web pages, and fits very nicely with vBulletin.

  ![](http://files.vbulletin.com/images/anncimg/vbulletin-skypeweb-popup.png)

  ![](http://files.vbulletin.com/images/anncimg/vbulletin-skypeweb-in-post.png)

  Please note that boards on which were installed the SkypeWeb plugin for vBulletin 3.5.3 will automatically have the plugin uninstalled and the full version inserted in its place.

  **Implementational changes: Archive**

  The output generated by the Archive is now buffered before being sent to the client. Plugins for the Archive that generate output must be adapted in order to work correctly.

  **Updating your vBulletin to combat the XSS flaw:**

  Versions of vBulletin 3.5 from 3.5.0 Beta 1 to 3.5.3 are affected by the XSS flaw so we recommend that customers upgrade or patch their installations.

  For the vBulletin 3.5.x branch, the problem can be resolved in one of three ways.
  1. **Full Upgrade**: The best way to fix the problem is to perform a full upgrade, downloading the complete 3.5.4 package from the [vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/) and following the regular [upgrade instructions](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade?manualversion=30502500).
  2. **Patch**: A second option is to download the patch files discussed in this thread and upload them to your web server, overwriting the existing files.
  3. **Plugin**: The plugin system built into vBulletin 3.5 allows the problem to be fixed with a simple plugin. The install file for this plugin is also attached to this thread and is the easiest way to fix the problem, as it does not require you to upload any files via FTP. The plugin will be automatically removed when you perform your next full upgrade. You can install the plugin by following the instructions [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/import_product?manualversion=30502500).For a complete list of bugs fixed in 3.5.4, please [click here](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs35.php?do=list&s=&textsearch=&bugtypeid=0&status=20&severity=0&vbversion=3.5.3&assignid=0&sortby=lastreply&sortdir=desc).

  **Notes**:
  + You do **not** need to install this plugin if you perform a full upgrade to 3.5.4
  + You do **not** need to install this plugin if you patch your board using the files attached to the previous post in this thread.
  + If you cannot download the patch, please see [this thread](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?t=79557).

  Template Changes Since 3.5.3

  **The are the template changes since 3.5.3 ONLY**

  **If you are not running 3.5.3 yet, there are significantly more changed templates than are listed here. Use "Find Updated Templates" to find the templates that have changed and incorporate those changes. You may even wish to start with a default style!**

  **Note:**

  You need to only look through this post for templates you have customized. You do not need to take any action to ensure that your uncustomized templates are the latest versions.

  If you find a template you have customized in this list, you will likely want to include the changes made here. However, this is not *always* required. Under each change listed here, you will see "requires revert?" This refers to whether the changes are **mandatory** (yes). If the changes are mandatory, things *will break* if you do not incorporate the changes made. It is *strongly recommended* that you revert and recustomize any templates that say they require a revert. If requires revert is listed as "no", your board should continue functioning without the changes, but any bug fixes/improvements will not be applied unless you revert the template!

  Additionally, you may wish to use the "Find Updated Templates" feature in the control panel to find templates that have been changed since your last edit to them.

  Tue 21 Feb '06, 12:27pm

  Due to issues that affect a limited number of customers when running the updated "Suspect File Versions" system (see the first post), **admincp/diagnostic.php** has been updated as of this post.

  You do not need to update this file if you do not plan on using this system or have already used it without any problem since upgrading to 3.5.4. Customers that may be affected will be running PHP versions less than 4.2.0 or have renamed their admin/moderator control panel directories.

  Issue with patch file

  An issue has been discovered with the version of functions.php in the patch file. This only affects users who have chosen to patch; full upgrades and those using the product to fix the security issue are not affected.

  The issue relates to some users not being able to stay logged in after applying the patch. If you have this problem, you should redownload the patch [from this page](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php). We apologize for any inconvienence.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
