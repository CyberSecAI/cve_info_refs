## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033

A [remote code execution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses a file and processes a malformed VEVENT record.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* MAPI is not a valid attack vector for this issue due to Exchange's handling of iCal calendar data embedded in messages or in .ICS attachments.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

  1. reg.exe export "HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\*\*\{0006F085-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\*\*" **c:\MapiCvt\_Class.reg**
  2. reg.exe delete "HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\*\*\{0006F085-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\*\*" **c:\MapiCvt\_Class.reg**

**Impact of Workaround:** Users will be unable to use the 'Send Update' feature to send updates to existing meetings from their calendar. Users will be able to create new meetings in their calendar but will be unable to use the 'Send' feature from the meeting invite to automatically send the meeting invite to other recipients. The meeting will be saved to the calendar but the invite will stay in the 'Outbox' folder. Users will be unable to forward meetings from the calendar as iCalendar requests.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Outlook VEVENT Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0033:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses a file and processes a malformed VEVENT record.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Outlook does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of an .iCal meeting request. When Outlook opens a specially crafted .iCal meeting request and parses a malformed VEVENT request, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is an .iCal meeting request?**

An iCal is used to create a meeting request to a recipient over the Internet, or outside the organization.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted .ICS (iCal) file or embed the contents of an iCal calendar request in the body of a specially crafted e-mail and send it to a user of Outlook who connects to a POP, IMAP or HTTP server to retrieve their e-mail.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Outlook validates the length of an .iCal meeting request before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305

A [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Outlook in its processing of e-mail header information. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could send a malformed e-mail to a user of Outlook that would cause the Outlook client to fail under certain circumstances. The Outlook client would continue to fail so long as the malformed e-mail message remained on the e-mail server. The e-mail message could be deleted by an e-mail administrator, or by the user via another e-mail client such as Outlook Web Access or Outlook Express, after which point the Outlook client would again function normally.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

* The vulnerability is a denial of service vulnerability only. The attacker would not be able to access the user's e-mail or system in any way. The vulnerability could not be used to read, delete, create, or alter the user's e-mail.
* If an attacker was able to send a malformed e-mail that successfully exploited this vulnerability, the malformed e-mail could be deleted either by an e-mail administrator, or by the user via another e-mail client such as Outlook Web Access or Outlook Express. Once the specially malformed e-mail has been removed, normal operation would resume.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Outlook Denial of Service Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1305:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding. During that time, the server cannot respond to requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results because of the way Outlook processes e-mail header information.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**Who could exploit the vulnerability?**

On Outlook, any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause Outlook to fail.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Outlook validates the length of the header in the message.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-1305.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

A [remote code execution](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses an .oss file.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office Saved Searches (.oss) file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

* Do not open or save Office Saved Searches (.oss) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Outlook Advanced Find Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0034:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Outlook parses an Office Saved Searches (.oss) file.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Outlook does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of .oss file. When Outlook opens a specially crafted .oss and parses the request, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is an Office Saved Searches (.oss) File?**

Saved Searches are virtual folders that contain views of e-mail items that satisfy specific search criteria. The specific search criteria are stored in .oss file.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted .oss file in a specially crafted e-mail and send it to a user of Outlook who connects to a POP, IMAP or HTTP server to retrieve their e-mail.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet. Microsoft has provided information about how you can help protect your PC. End users can visit the [Protect Your PC Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21169). IT professionals can visit the [Security Guidance Center Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21171).

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Override installation command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

For additional information about the supported setup switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 197147](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197147).

**Administrative Deployment Information**

To update your administrative installation, perform the following procedure:

1. [Download the security update for Outlook 2002.](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/5/785738cf-0899-4572-bf0b-c2c855efa749/officexp-kb921594-fullfile-enu.exe)
2. Click **Save this program to disk**, and then click **OK**.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK** to extract the .msp file:
   **[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate**

   **Note** Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.
5. Click **Yes** to accept the License Agreement.
6. Click **Yes** if you are prompted to create the folder.
7. If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command, and then click **OK**:
   **msiexec /a** *Admin Path*\*\*\\*\*MSI File \*\*/p C:\adminUpdate\\*\**MSP File* **SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE**

   **Note** *Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\OfficeXp), *MSI File* is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *MSP File* is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).

   **Note** You can append /**qb+** to the command line so that the **Administrative Installation** dialog box and the **End User License Agreement** dialog box do not appear.
8. Click **Next** in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.
9. Click **I accept the terms in the License Agreement**, and then click **Install**.

At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstation configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, see the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.

**Warning** Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the âWorkstation Deployment Informationâ section for this workstation.

**Workstation Deployment Information**

To deploy the update to the client workstations, click **Start**, click **Run,** and then type the following command:

**msiexec /i**Admin Path\MSI **File /qb REINSTALL=Feature List REINSTALLMODE=vomu**

**Note***Admin Path* is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\OfficeXP), *MSI File* is the MSI database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and *Feature List* is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that have to be reinstalled for the update. To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL**.

To install all features, you can use **REINSTALL=ALL** or you can install the following features.

| Product | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| OUTLOOK, PIPC1, PROPLUS, PRO, SBE, STD, STDEDU | OUTLOOKNonBootFiles, OUTLOOKFiles, OutlookMAPIEMS2, OutlookDVExtensionsFiles, OutlookVBScript |

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
