[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912442](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912442) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update on Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912442](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912442).
[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912918](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912918) : Users cannot send e-mail messages from a mobile device or from a shared mailbox in Exchange 2000 Server and in Exchange Server 2003.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the "Vulnerability Details" section of this bulletin, this update includes the following changes in security functionality:

Prior to the Exchange 2003 versions listed above, granting the Full Mailbox Access permission implicitly granted permission to send as the mailbox owner. This meant that another account with Full Mailbox Access could send messages that appeared as if they were sent by the mailbox owner. After applying the security update on Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 1 or Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2, for a user to impersonate a mailbox owner, you will need to grant Send As permissions to the user. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912918](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/912918).

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Deployment Information**

To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt:

**Exchange2000-KB912442-x86-enu /quiet**

**Restart Requirement:**

This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. To help reduce the chance that a reboot will be required, stop all affected services and close all applications that may use the affected files prior to installing the security update. For more information about the reasons why you may be prompted to restart your computer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887012](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/887012).

**Removal Information:**

To remove this update, use Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

System administrators can use the Spuninst.exe utility to remove this security update. The Spuninst.exe utility is located in the %Windir%\$ExchUninstall912442$\Spuninst folder.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |

**File Information:**

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the **Time Zone** tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

Exchange 2000 Server Service Pack 3:

| File Name | Version | Date | Time | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mdbmsg.dll | 6.0.6618.4 | 31-Jan-2006 | 05:21 | 2,342,912 |
| Store.exe | 6.0.6618.4 | 31-Jan-2006 | 19:04 | 4,714,496 |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:

  HKEY\_LOCAl\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Exchange Server 2000\SP4\KB912442\Filelist

**Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the KB912442 security update into the Windows installation source files.

# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Microsoft Outlook Web Access for Exchange Server script injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#138188

Original Release Date: 2006-06-13 | Last Revised: 2006-06-13

---

### Overview

A script injection vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange Server running Outlook Web Access.

### Description

| Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) is a service of [Exchange Server](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx). OWA allows authorized users to read and send email, manage their calendar, and perform other functions on an Exchange server via the Web.  Outlook Web Access fails to correctly filter script contained in an email message under certain circumstances. This results in a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to supply script that would be executed by a user using OWA to read email. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to supply an email message containing specially crafted script may be able to execute the script in the security context of the victim user on the client system. Microsoft states that user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Microsoft has published patches for this issue in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS06-029](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-029.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  In addition to the patches, Microsoft has also published a number of [workarounds](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-032.mspx#ELIAC) for this issue in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-029](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-029.mspx). Users, particularly those who are unable to apply the patch, are encouraged to implement these workarounds. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
