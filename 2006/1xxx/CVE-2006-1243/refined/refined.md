{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `install05.php` script in Simple PHP Blog versions 0.4.7.1 and below does not properly sanitize the `blog_language` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unvalidated input leading to file inclusion vulnerability",
        "The install script is not removed after the installation, making it always available for exploit",
         "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution. By injecting PHP code into web server logs (e.g., Apache access logs) and then including the log file with the vulnerable parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `install05.php` script",
        "Manipulating the `blog_language` parameter to include arbitrary local files and/or server logs"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. If the server is configured to `magic_quotes_gpc = Off`, then the null byte injection will work. If the server logs to accessible locations, the attacker can inject code and include those logs via `blog_language` parameter."
