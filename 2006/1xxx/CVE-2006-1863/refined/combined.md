How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c0)  Bastien Nocera    2006-04-18 15:17:56 UTC  ``` 1. Mount an NFS mount with non-default rsize and wsize:  amd64:/tmp on /mnt/iso type nfs (rw,nfsvers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,nointr,addr=172.16.10.230)  2. Launch a simple test program which calls statvfs/statfs: #include <sys/statvfs.h> int main (int argc, char **argv) {         struct statvfs statfs_buffer;         statvfs ("/mnt/iso/", &statfs_buffer);         return 0; }  3. Check the strace of that program statfs64("/mnt/iso/", 84, {f_type="NFS_SUPER_MAGIC", f_bsize=8192, f_blocks=1764078, f_bfree=1252601, f_bavail=1162989, f_files=1795200, f_ffree=1584215, f_fsid={0, 0}, f_namelen=255, f_frsize=4096}) = 0  The f_frsize member says "4096" instead of "8192". gnome-vfs and df (when using statvfs) and this code to calculate the amount of space left on a filesystem: free = statfs_buffer.f_frsize * statfs_buffer.f_bavail  On a stock RHEL4 system, df is actually using statfs so doesn't show this problem: free = fsd.f_bsize * fsd.f_bavail   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c4)  Bastien Nocera    2006-07-18 13:15:22 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 182596](show_bug.cgi?id=182596 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Wrong hrStorageSize for NFS-mounted file system") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c5)  Amit Gud    2006-07-18 17:29:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 132610](attachment.cgi?id=132610 "reproducer program") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=132610&action=edit "reproducer program") reproducer program  With the attached program, no occurance of bug found on 2.6.17-1.2356.fc6 and 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5. statvfs reports correct f_frsize with mount options rw,nfsvers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,nointr  Would be good to know the kernel version or the rhel version on which the bug was observed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c6)  Bastien Nocera    2006-07-19 07:35:48 UTC  ``` The RHEL version is the one mentioned in the "Version" field. The test kernel was the latest stable RHEL4 kernel: 2.6.9-34.EL   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c7)  Amit Gud    2006-07-22 20:59:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 132872](attachment.cgi?id=132872&action=diff "fix 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=132872&action=edit "fix 1") fix 1  I was able to successfully reproduce the bug on 2.6.9-42.EL and it does go away with the attached fix. Upstream kernel and even devel branch of rhel kernel takes frsize as blocksize in superblock. I'm trying to find out exactly which patch changes this particular code. However, attached fix should serve the purpose.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c8)  mike eisler    2006-08-08 03:50:58 UTC  ``` My understanding is the  NFS client file system  should be able to use what ever it wants for f_frsize. As long as               tbytes = f_frsize * f_blocks        fbytes = f_frsize * f_bfree                  abytes = f_frsize * f_bavail  That said, it is pointless, for NFS, if not all other file systems, to have f_frsize be different than f_bsize. It just causes confusion.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=189238#c9)  RHEL Program Management    2006-09-07 19:21:43 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=189588#c0)  Bastien Nocera    2006-04-21 13:16:37 UTC  ``` Using kernel-2.6.9-34.EL, running pstack on the attached test case takes 10 minutes.  Using the upstream 2.6.16, running pstack takes about 48 seconds.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=189588#c1)  Bastien Nocera    2006-04-21 13:16:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128084](attachment.cgi?id=128084 "test.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128084&action=edit "test.c") test.c   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=189588#c2)  Anil S Keshavamurthy    2006-05-08 22:14:18 UTC  ``` I am unable to reproduce the bug.  The attached test case (id=128084) has sleep(3000) which is executed from all the threads and the pthread_join() call waits untill all the child thread finishes executing sleep(3000). So I don't see how this can complete in just 48 seconds on upstream kernel.My testresults did behave the exact same way on both upsteam(2.6.17-rc3) and RHEL4 kernel.   Can you retest you test case once again and let me know the results.      ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=189588#c3)  Keiichi Mori    2006-05-09 03:29:04 UTC  ``` This problem is that it takes much time for pstack command to get stack information.  Here's steps to reproduce; 1. run test case on ia64:   # gcc -o test test.c -lpthread   # ./test 2. run pstack for the test case:   # ps ax | grep test   29272 pts/1    Sl     0:00 ./test   # pstack 29272  Actual result:   it takes 10 minutes or more.  Expected result:   it takes much shorter time.   same performance with 2.6.16 is expected at least. (48sec or so)  Additional Info:  on x86 environment, pstack takes only 3 seconds.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=18#c0)  mikpe    1998-11-10 06:26:41 UTC  ``` RH 5.2's "mt" command is built from mt-st-0.5, which contains a rather annoying bug.  The bug occurs when (a) the -f <device> option is used, and (b) a command is given which requires a "count" or some subcommands, eg. "mt -f /dev/nftape drvbuffer 16".  The bug is that in these cases, the count/subcommands are read from the wrong elements of main()'s argv[], as if the -f option wasn't given, leading to incorrect values being passed in ioctl calls to the tape's device driver.  A temporary workaround is to avoid the -f option, and instead set TAPE=<your tape device> in the environment.  The proper fix is to apply the following trivial patch:  --- mt-st-0.5/mt.c.~1~  Sat Apr 11 16:58:25 1998 +++ mt-st-0.5/mt.c      Tue Nov 10 11:02:11 1998 @@ -282,7 +282,7 @@         mtfd = (-1);       if (comp->cmd_function != NULL) -       i = comp->cmd_function(mtfd, comp, argc - 2, &(argv[2])); +       i = comp->cmd_function(mtfd, comp, argc - argn, &(argv[argn]));      else {         fprintf(stderr, "mt: Internal error: command without function.\n");         i = 1;   /Mikael   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=18#c1)  hargrove    1998-11-25 21:13:59 UTC  ``` This bug is fixed in mt-st-0.5b available from ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/backup/mt-st-0.5b.tar.gz   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=18#c2)  Preston Brown    1999-02-10 21:32:59 UTC  ``` this has been fixed in rawhide.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=18#c3)  jhart    2000-02-18 13:11:59 UTC  ``` This bug appears to persist in 0.5b.
