Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1694:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `members.php` script of XBrite Members version 1.1. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to "Off" in the PHP configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code. This is because `magic_quotes_gpc` is disabled.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input which leads to the SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and password hashes. The provided exploit demonstrates this by extracting username and password.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, attackers may be able to further manipulate the database, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or complete control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the URL.
*   **Publicly Accessible Webpage:** The `members.php` file is accessible via web and thus the attack vector is publicly accessible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the server running XBrite Members.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the SQL injection vulnerability to construct a malicious request and exploit it.
*   **PHP Configuration:** The `magic_quotes_gpc` directive needs to be set to "Off" on the targeted server for the vulnerability to be exploitable using the provided method.
