Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-1359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles certain unexpected method calls to HTML objects, specifically involving the `createTextRange()` method. When this method is called on specific DHTML objects, it can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of the `createTextRange()` method results in memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **DHTML Method Handling:** A flaw exists in how Internet Explorer processes Dynamic HTML (DHTML) methods, specifically this one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of an affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation gives the attacker the same user rights as the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** The attacker would need to host a malicious web page containing the exploit. They would have to trick users into visiting this page, typically through phishing links in emails or other messaging platforms.
*   **Email Exploitation:** While not automatically exploitable through viewing emails in preview panes, clicking on a link in a specially crafted HTML email, or opening a malicious attachment could also trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Compromised Websites:**  Websites that accept user-provided content, advertisements, or compromised websites, could be used to host this malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing any prior access to the victim's system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to get the user to visit a malicious webpage.
*   **Crafted HTML:** The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious HTML page containing the specific exploit for this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for most versions of Internet Explorer.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a specific behavior in Internet Explorer's handling of the `createTextRange()` method on certain HTML objects.
*   The vulnerability is publicly known and has been assigned CVE-2006-1359.
*   Microsoft has acknowledged that the vulnerability is being actively exploited.
*   This vulnerability impacts a wide range of operating systems, including Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2003 and others.
