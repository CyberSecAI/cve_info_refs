Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1123:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `memName` parameter in `profile.asp` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through a cookie.
*   **Script Insertion (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):** The `msg` field in `default.asp` is not properly sanitized before being used, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied data (specifically the `memName` cookie value) when constructing SQL queries.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of input sanitization on user input (specifically the `msg` POST parameter), leading to script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries, which could lead to data leakage. Specifically, the advisory mentions extracting usernames and passwords of administrators.
*   **Script Insertion (XSS):** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in a user's browser when they view the affected page. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted `memName` cookie sent to the `profile.asp` page.
*   **Script Insertion (XSS):** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to `default.asp`, specifically by injecting malicious code into the `msg` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie (i.e., send HTTP requests with malicious cookies).
*  **Script Insertion (XSS):** The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable page (`default.asp`) with malicious content in the `msg` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in d2kBlog version 1.0.3 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by FarhadKey and DevilBox of KAPDA.
*   Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were provided for both SQL Injection and Script Insertion:
    *   SQL Injection PoC: setting the `memName` cookie to `[SQL_Injection]`
    *   XSS PoC: sending a POST request to `default.asp` with `msg=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
*   The vendor was contacted about two months before the report release date, but no patch was available as of the advisory.
