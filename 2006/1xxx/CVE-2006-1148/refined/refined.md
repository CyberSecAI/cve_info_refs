Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-1148

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `nextCGIarg()` function of PeerCast's URL handling code. The function allocates buffers on the stack that can be overflowed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling URLs, allowing an attacker to write past the allocated buffer space on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the PeerCast server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the PeerCast server.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that overflows the stack buffer.

**Additional Details:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200603-17) confirms the vulnerability and provides details about affected versions and remediation.
- The vulnerability was discovered by INFIGO.
- The issue is located in the `nextCGIarg()` function used for URL handling.
