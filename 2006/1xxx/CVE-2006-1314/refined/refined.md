  "CVE-2006-1314": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SRV.SYS driver, specifically during the processing of first-class mailslot messages.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Heap buffer overflow in SRV.SYS driver.",
        "Ability to exceed second-class mailslot message size limitation."
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems, with code execution occurring within the context of the kernel. Applications built on mailslot communications that rely on the message size restriction of second-class mailslots are also affected.",
      "Attack vector": "A specially crafted network packet sent via SMB to a vulnerable system, exploiting first-class mailslot message processing.",
       "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send network packets to the affected system. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. This could be done over a local network or the Internet."
    }
