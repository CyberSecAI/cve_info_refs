- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `LinuxGpib.so` library included an rpath (runtime path) pointing to `/tmp/buildd/...`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The rpath pointed to a directory that is world-writable (`/tmp`), allowing a local user to place malicious shared libraries in that location. When `LinuxGpib.so` is loaded, it would then load and execute the malicious libraries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could gain arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the `LinuxGpib.so` library, potentially escalating to root privileges if the vulnerable application runs as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local user writes a malicious shared library to `/tmp/buildd/gpib-3.2.06/build-tree/linux-gpib-3.2.06/language/perl/../../lib/.libs`, which will be loaded by `LinuxGpib.so`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with write access to the `/tmp` directory.
