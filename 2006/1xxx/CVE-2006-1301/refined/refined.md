  "cve": "CVE-2006-1301",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Excel that results from the processing of a malformed SELECTION record. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Excel file that could allow remote code execution.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a malformed SELECTION record in an Excel file. When Excel opens such a file, it may corrupt system memory in a way that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of record length before passing the message to an allocated buffer."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attacks where an attacker hosts a malicious Excel file on a website.",
      "Email-based attacks where an attacker sends a malicious Excel file to the user.",
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Excel file with a malformed SELECTION record and trick the user into opening it. This can be through social engineering or by exploiting a website the user visits.",
    "required_privileges": "The attacker gains the same user rights as the user who opens the malicious file. If the user is an administrator, the attacker gains full control of the system."
  },
  "affected_software": [
    "Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3",
    "Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3",
    "Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2",
      "Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac",

  "workarounds": [
    "Do not open or save Microsoft Excel files that you receive from un-trusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources."
  ],
   "patch_info": [
        "The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Excel validates the length of a record before it passes the message to the allocated buffer."
