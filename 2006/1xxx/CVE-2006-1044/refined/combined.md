How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Release Notes for LISTSERV® Version 14.5

Copyright © 2006
L-Soft international, Inc.

3/2/2006 4:25 PM

| **IMPORTANT: LISTSERV 14.5 requires a version 14.5 LAK!**    You must obtain and install a LISTSERV version 14.5 product LAK prior to upgrading your server, or LISTSERV will not start after the upgrade.    [More information](#applying) |

# Product Managers Message

With all the
controversy and concerns surrounding the possible introduction of pay-for-send
e-mail, we felt that an early release of the LISTSERV 15.0 deliverability
improvements would help familiarize everyone with DomainKeys, SPF, Sender ID
and other authentication technology. When implemented correctly, these
authentication tools can improve your deliverability, making it less likely
that your legitimate messages be erroneously caught in spam filters. As we
expect major ISPs to tighten up their spam filters in the coming months, we
advise all customers to carefully review the Deliverability Assessment report
now accessible through the web interface, and at least prepare for the addition
of DomainKeys signatures to outbound messages.

But lets first
take a pragmatic look at the pay-for-send controversy. Will it really happen?
Will only the largest and wealthiest companies be able to reach out to their
customers, leaving non-profits and academia out in the cold? I am confident
that none of this will happen, for two simple reasons. First, while it is true
that a lot of people support the idea of charging for e-mail, they do so
because they have read in the press that it will end spam. But, if you read the
articles in question carefully, you will see that this is the journalists
opinion, or at best the opinion of an industry watcher. Neither AOL nor anyone
in the e-mail industry has claimed that an e-mail fee could so much as reduce
spam, let alone eliminate it. We did not make any such claims because we know
that todays spammers are oozing cash and would wait in line to buy their way
past spam filters with hard currency if that were to become an option. They
have worked very hard on their ROI and can absolutely afford a quarter of a
cent per message and still make money. The truth is that modern spam
offerings, such as offshore pharmacy, are very profitable. Todays spammers
are richer than most legitimate businesses and can afford to pay more for
e-mail stamps than the local concert hall or sport accessory store.

The second reason I
am not worried about pay-for-send is that the proposed fee is exorbitant, and a
market economy does not tolerate that for long. Authenticating L-Softs modest
hosting service would cost up to $15 million per year. No matter how you look
at it, this is an outrageous figure. It is many times our hosting revenues,
thousands of times reasonable actual costs, in fact it reads like a figure out
of a dot-boom business plan.

We can do better
with technology based on open standards, but, alas, not today. The open
standard community was taken by surprise and will need some time to recoup and
extend current protocols to provide reputation and certification services.
Meanwhile, everybody who opposes pay-for-send needs to become familiar with the
technology that we have today, and deploy it not just as a vote of confidence,
but because it provides concrete benefits today. This is where 14.5 comes into
the picture, with DomainKeys support (previously released as an open beta for
14.4), and a comprehensive Deliverability Assessment report that analyzes
DomainKeys, SPF, Sender ID and DNS registrations and makes detailed suggestions
for improvement. Another reason to try out the Deliverability Assessment is
that it is built with the upcoming 15.0 interface, and now is the ideal time to
send us any comments that you might have. Unfortunately, the 15.0 navigation
and a few other minor functions had to be disabled to make the screens work
with 14.5.

Looking ahead, I
see two more steps to the first genuinely effective, reputation-based spam
prevention tools. The first is a revised DKIM specification supporting
reputation and certification services (DKIM is an Internet standardization
effort combining DomainKeys and Identified Internet Mail). I expect this to be
a simple technology update; for L-Soft customers, it will just mean a new
version of LISTSERV to install. This will create a framework for the second
step  the emergence of reputation/certification services on a level playing
field, with competition keeping prices to reasonable levels. I envision two
complementary business models for these services. On the one hand, companies
like Dun & Bradstreet could provide e-mail reputation ratings in addition
to other financial data, a service that e-mail receivers could purchase in
order to help filter out spam from their mailboxes. Companies like VeriSign, on
the other hand, could sell reputation certificates to senders, a service that
e-mail receivers could access for free. Receivers would choose which reputation
providers (of either type) they want to use to screen incoming mail. Because
almost everyone would be able to afford certification, almost every message
would be certified and bypass spam filters. The spam filters in turn would be
able to screen messages more carefully, and in particular it would probably be
acceptable to put the occasional non-certified messages through quarantine,
allowing more time for spam sources to be identified and listed.

Getting back to
14.5, we also decided to expedite the release of another 15.0 feature, unixODBC
support. With MySQL now playing in the same league as big name databases, and
unixODBC included with major Linux distributions, this feature was an ideal
candidate for early release. There was a (small) price to pay, though: we have
not had the time to test unixODBC support with other databases than MySQL. So,
for now, we recommend the native OCI and CLI interfaces for Oracle and DB2.

# SECURITY

## WA Security Alert

A number of buffer
overruns were found in the WA CGI stage for all platforms after the release of
LISTSERV 14.4. This discovery triggered a full code audit and overhaul of WA
for LISTSERV 14.5.

As a result, L-Soft
*strongly recommends* that all LISTSERV 14.4 sites upgrade to 14.5, and
particularly ensure that their existing production WA CGI script be updated
with the current WA version.

The vunerabilities
were found and graciously reported by Peter Winter-Smith of Next Generation
Security Software, Ltd. (www.ngssoftware.com). We thank Mr. Winter-Smith for
his contribution and patience with us as we took steps to eliminate these
problems.

# USABILITY

## Support for DomainKeys Message Signing

*This
feature is not available in LISTSERV Lite.*

Starting
with version 14.5, LISTSERV supports [DomainKeys](http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys) for outbound mail as described in the
Internet draft [draft-delany-domainkeys-base-03](http://nis.nsf.net/internet/documents/internet-drafts/draft-delany-domainkeys-base-03.txt) .

Additionally,
LISTSERV HPO for Windows, Linux-x86, and FreeBSD incorporates a DomainKeys
Accelerator for faster signing of messages. The accelerator requires an Intel
or AMD processor with SSE2 support. If SSE2 support is not detected, LISTSERV
will not enable the DomainKeys Accelerator and will log the following message
at start time:

>23 Feb 2006 14:26:43 DomainKeys
Accelerator disabled:

>23 Feb 2006 14:26:43 -> Processor
lacks SSE2 support

### Setting up LISTSERV to use DomainKeys

Please
see the supplementary document [*Using LISTSERV with DomainKeys*](http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/LISTSERV-DKIM-config.html). It is necessary to configure LISTSERV
appropriately before the following new features can be used.

### Using DomainKeys with Mailing Lists

·
If
DomainKeys support has been enabled in the configuration, LISTSERV will sign
all outbound messages for mailing lists, including administrative messages,
welcome messages, etc.

* "Misc-Options=
  NO\_DKIM\_SIGNATURE" can be added in the list header (or made
  the system default via the DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS configuration variable) to
  override this.

* Incoming DomainKeys or DKIM
  signatures submitted to a mailing list will be removed unless "Misc-Options=
  KEEP\_DKIM\_SIGNATURE" is set in the list configuration. This is
  necessary because these signatures almost never match after the message
  has been processed. The worst thing that could possibly happen to your
  deliverability is a DomainKeys signature that does not match and causes
  the message to be flagged as suspicious.

  The KEEP\_DKIM\_SIGNATURE option is experimental and not meant for general
  use. As DomainKeys is specified today, signatures DO NOT survive posting
  to mailing lists (LISTSERV or otherwise), so LISTSERV removes them by
  default to avoid triggering alerts for subscribers on systems that have
  implemented the client side of DomainKeys. The DKIM specification may be
  more robust in this respect, but even DKIM signatures will probably not
  survive when posted through a mailing list. Use the KEEP\_DKIM\_SIGNATURE
  option at your own risk.

If
desired, either or both options can be specified for all lists via the
DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS= site configuration variable.

### Using DomainKeys in DISTRIBUTE Jobs

A
new DKIM=NO|YES option has been added to
DISTRIBUTE (default: NO). This will fail if running a LISTSERV version without
DomainKeys support, but otherwise it always succeeds. Messages originating from
domains for which LISTSERV has been configured to sign will be signed, while
those originating from other domains won't be.

### Using DomainKeys to Sign Other Types of Messages

Once
you have become comfortable with DomainKeys signatures, you may want to have
LISTSERV sign *every* message that it
generates, regardless of its source. Setting DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL=1
in the site configuration file tells LISTSERV to try to sign every message for
which it has a suitable private key, as defined in the DKIM\_SIGN configuration
parameter (see [*Using LISTSERV with DomainKeys*](http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/LISTSERV-DKIM-config.html) for details). For example:

| VM | DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL = 1 |
| --- | --- |
| VMS: | DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL "1" |
| unix: | DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL=1  export DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL |
| Win: | DKIM\_SIGN\_ALL=1 |

### Restrictions and Implementation Choices

* LISTSERV will not sign messages
  that already have a DomainKeys signature. Double DomainKeys signatures are
  disallowed in most cases and, even when allowed, there is a risk that they
  may not be handled correctly by all implementations. This does not apply
  if the incoming DomainKeys signature has been discarded (for example, a mailing list
  without "Misc-Options= KEEP\_DKIM\_SIGNATURE").
  In that case, the message can be signed without risk of false positive.

* DomainKeys can be used to sign
  mail-merge messages; however, in this case, LISTSERV's Embedded Mail Merge
  (EMM) feature MUST be enabled (even if you are using LSMTP). Using EMM is
  the only way to guarantee that the signing engine will see the exact text
  being sent to the recipient, and that the signature will match.

## New DeliverabilityAssessment Tool

As
spam filters become more and more aggressive, there is a growing risk for
legitimate email to be blocked or relegated to spam folders. LISTSERV's new
Deliverability Assessment tool will analyze your LISTSERV and DNS configurations
and compare them to "best practices," giving you concrete advice on
improving your deliverability.

The
tool offers the following tests based on the return address hostname and the IP
address of the originating server:

·
[DomainKeys](http://antispam.yahoo.com/domainkeys): Yahoo! is the most significant
proponent of the DomainKeys system, which is a public key/private key
certification process. The public key for a given domain is stored in DNS and
the corresponding private key is used to sign mail originating from that
domain. The Yahoo!Mail web client displays a small notification for recipients
that tells the user whether or not the mail is so certified. Other clients may
have similar DomainKeys features.

·
[Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](http://www.openspf.org/): SPF is an open certification protocol
that is also DNS-based. Sites using SPF to verify mail origination perform a
DNS lookup to verify that the sending server is authorized to originate mail
for the given domain. AOL, Pobox.Com, and GMail are possibly the largest SPF
users at this time.

·
[Sender ID](http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/safety/technologies/senderid/default.mspx): SenderID is a closed certification
protocol, also using DNS authentication-certification, being backed by
Microsoft primarily for its Hotmail and MSN services.

·
Domain Name Service test: Deliverability Assessment
will also check DNS for the presence of A (address), MX (mail-exchanger), and
PTR (reverse lookup) records for the hostname being assessed. Many email
providers require at least an A record, and many also require a PTR record, to
certify that mail is actually originating from the host it claims to be coming
from.

Each
test response is self-documented and, where appropriate, contains links to
external resources describing the protocol in question. Test results are
displayed with large green, orange, and red icons to help the administrator
quickly zero in on problem areas.

The
Deliverability Assessment tool can be reached from the
Server Management Main Page.

## New DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS Site Configuration Setting

A DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS variable is now available
for use in the site configuration file. When populated with one or more of the
available values for the Misc-Options= list header keyword, it sets a default
for all lists that do not already have a Misc-Options= setting. If a list has a
Misc-Options= keyword, the site-level setting is normally overridden. For
instance, if you have (using Windows site.cfg for an example)

DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE

and a given list has

\*
Misc-Options= RESPECT\_EMAIL\_CASE

then the list-level option overrides the
site-level option.

You may also prefix options in
DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS with either a plus or minus sign (no space between the +/-
sign and the name of the option). As before, an unprefixed option is
active if the list owner did not specify the corresponding option in the
list's "Misc-Options=" keyword, and is otherwise ignored.

An option prefixed with a plus sign is always
active, for every list. There is no way for the list owner to turn it off.
Therefore, if we modified our example above to read

DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=+IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE

then that would always override any list-level
setting.

Likewise, an option prefixed with a minus signed
is prohibited and will be ignored if specified in the list header. Therefore
something like

DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=-NO\_SPAM\_CHECK

would disallow list owners from disabling the
spam check for their list by setting "Misc-Options= NO\_SPAM\_CHECK".

**DOCUMENTED RESTRICTION:**
Using the plus and minus prefixes together for the same option (for instance,
"DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=+-NO\_SPAM\_CHECK")
will produce unpredictable results and is not supported.

Multiple options for DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS are
specified in the usual space-separated manner.

Examples:

| VM | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS = '+IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE SUPPRESS\_APPROVED\_BY' |
| --- | --- |
| VMS: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS "+IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE SUPPRESS\_APPROVED\_BY" |
| unix: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS="+IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE SUPPRESS\_APPROVED\_BY"  export DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS |
| Win: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=+IGNORE\_EMAIL\_CASE SUPPRESS\_APPROVED\_BY |

## New IETF\_SUBJECT\_TAG Setting for "Misc-Options=" List Header Keyword

It is now possible to add subject tags to IETF
headers (that is, for users who are set to the IETFHDR personal option).
However, as this can be considered a violation of the practice for IETF-style
headers, it can be prevented site-wide by the site administrator if desired.

Adding "Misc-Options=
IETFHDR\_SUBJECT\_TAG" causes the IETFHDR option to always include
subject tags (by default, they do not include any subject tags).

The IETFHDR\_SUBJECT\_TAG option can be disallowed
by the site administrator by setting

| VM | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS = '-IETF\_SUBJECT\_TAG' |
| --- | --- |
| VMS: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS "-IETF\_SUBJECT\_TAG" |
| unix: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS="-IETF\_SUBJECT\_TAG"  export DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS |
| Win: | DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS=-IETF\_SUBJECT\_TAG |

as described in the preceding section.

## New SUBJECTHDR\_SEQUENCE Setting for "Misc-Options=" List Header Keyword

For LISTSERV 14.5, it is possible for each list
posting to have a sequence number attributed to it, which can be seen by
subscribers who are set to the SUBJECTHDR personal option. This new feature is
enabled by adding "Misc-Options= SUBJECTHDR\_SEQUENCE" to the list
header. It can be enabled by default for all lists on the server by adding
SUBJECTHDR\_SEQUENCE to DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS. The format of the new subject tag
is

[listname - number]

```
For example:
```
```

```
```
Subject: [TEST - 256] Test of SUBJECTHDR_SEQUENCE
```

where 'number' is a sequence number, starting
from 1 and increasing.

The "Subject-Tag=" list header keyword
is still used to change the text of the subject tag.

## RFC2369 Headers Now Supported for List Postings

Support has been added for [RFC2369](http://nis.nsf.net/internet/documents/rfc/rfc2369.txt), which
calls for the use of message headers such as "List-Help",
"List-Subscribe", and "List-Unsubscribe". A list posting
using these headers will look like this:

```
Date: Fri, 21 Oct 2005 14:21:03 -0500

Reply-To: Test list <TEST@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM>
```
```
Sender: Test list <TEST@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM>
```

From: Some User <someuser@EXAMPLE.COM>

Subject: What's all this RFC2369 stuff?

To: TEST@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM

Precedence: list

List-Help: <http://listserv.example.com/scripts/wa.exe?LIST=TEST>,

<mailto:LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM?body=INFO+TEST>

List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:TEST-unsubscribe-request@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM>

List-Subscribe: <mailto:TEST-subscribe-request@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM>

List-Owner: <mailto:TEST-request@LISTSERV.EXAMPLE.COM>

List-Archive:
<http://listserv.example.com/scripts/wa.exe?LIST=TEST>

I was curious about these new headers, can someone enlighten me?

RFC2369 support is activated by default and
supplies all of the headers specified in the standard except
"List-Post:", which L-Soft considers to be redundant.

In compliance with RFC2369, LISTSERV discards
any pre-existing List-xxx tags.

RFC2369 compliance can be disabled using:

\*
Misc-Options= NO\_RFC2369

and this can also be specified in the site-wide
DEFAULT\_MISC\_OPTIONS variable. When RFC2369 support is disabled, you get the
old behavior; that is, the tags are neither added nor removed.

## unixODBC Support for MySQL

LISTSERV 14.5 for unix now supports MySQL
databases accessed via unixODBC as datastores. The prerequisite for this
support is that unixODBC *must* be installed on the unix machine that is
running LISTSERV.

The LISTSERV implementation is similar to that
for CLI, except that the prefixes are UODBC instead of CLI. You define UODBC\_DSN
and so on in your configuration, and you use "DBMS= UODBC" or just
"DBMS= Yes" in your lists and DISTRIBUTE jobs. For instance, the site
configuration for a unixODBC datasource called GREEN would look like this:

UODBC\_DSN="GREEN"

UODBC\_UID="..."

UODBC\_AUTH="..."

export
UODBC\_DSN UODBC\_UID UODBC\_AUTH

(Replace the ellipses with appropriate
DBMS-specific authentication information.)

It is possible to connect to all kinds of
databases (as opposed to MySQL only) using unixODBC, but at this time L-Soft does
not formally support the use of databases other than MySQL with unixODBC. We
would be interested in hearing the results of tests conducted in the field with
other DBMS products and would be willing to consider adding support based on
those results.

For more information on setting up unixODBC to
work with LISTSERV, please see the [Developer's
Guide to LISTSERV](http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/developer/developer.html).

## New Loopcheck= Default

In LISTSERV 14.5, the new loopcheck heuristic
defaults to "Loopcheck= Normal" (which is itself a new option to that
keyword setting) if there is no explicit "Loopcheck=" setting in the
list header. This is a backward-compatible change that eliminates from the
default test suite the test that results in the error *"Sender:",
"From:" or "Reply-To:" field pointing to the list*.

L-Soft has decided to change the default in 14.5
to eliminate this test because the kinds of loops it was designed to prevent no
longer occur on a typical discussion list; most MTAs that were responsible for
them have long since been fixed. On the other hand, there are still exceptions,
and this test remains the only reliable way to catch these kinds of loops. To
put things in perspective, whenever you post something to a discussion list and
you, the poster, receive a notice that the mailbox does not exist, it is a
signal that the list may be at risk for this type of loop. Nowadays, this
almost never happens, but there are still lists where it does. In addition, the
larger the list, the higher the risk.

If you don't want to lose this test when 14.5 is
installed on your server, you should add "Loopcheck= Full" to your
list header(s) prior to the upgrade. You may also set this value at the site
level with the new DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK site configuration variable; for example,

| VM | DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK = 'FULL' |
| --- | --- |
| VMS: | DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK "FULL" |
| unix: | DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK="FULL"  export DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK |
| Win: | DEFAULT\_LOOPCHECK=FULL |

This setting may then be overridden at the list
level if desired. The default value is NORMAL.

In the future, it is anticipated that other
tests found to be obsolete will be moved from the "Normal" suite to
the "Full" suite, for the same backward compatibility.

## New Embedded Mail-Merge (EMM) Default

In LISTSERV 14.5, the Embedded Mail-Merge (EMM)
feature introduced in LISTSERV 14.4 is now the default.  This is necessary in order to enable all
LISTSERV sites to create [DomainKeys signatures](#dkim).

Given the high performance of EMM, this change
is unlikely to have any noticeable impact for the average site.  Very high-volume LSMTP sites or sites
running older hardware may notice performance degradation, and if so, will need
either to re-tune their servers or to revert to the old default.

To switch back to the pre-14.5 default (or to
set it explicitly before upgrading to LISTSERV 14.5), set

| VM: | EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE = 0 |
| --- | --- |
| VMS: | EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE "0" |
| unix: | EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE=0  export EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE |
| Win: | EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE=0 |

in LISTSERV's site configuration file and
restart the server.  Please remember
that disabling Embedded Mail-Merge will also disable your server's ability to
generate DomainKeys signatures.

# WEB INTERFACE - WA

## Current Version

LISTSERV 14.5 requires that the Web
interface (commonly known as "wa") is version 2.3.42 R1559 or later.
To determine what version of "wa" you currently have running, browse
to http://yourserver/path-to-wa/wa?DEBUG-SHOW-VERSION for unix, or
http://yourserver/path-to-wa/wa.exe?DEBUG-SHOW-VERSION for Windows and
OpenVMS).

## Other WA Improvements

* The privacy token <[login to
  unmask]> that hides email addresses in displayed postings for
  publicly-viewable lists is now a link to the login page.

* Most
  if not all national language encoding problems for subject lines in WA
  have been fixed.

·
A problem that caused duplicate listings to be
displayed in the list-level table of contents has been fixed.

* A
  problem that would cause WA to display a "Log In" link when the
  user was already logged in on pages that did not require authentication
  has been fixed.

* The
  web posting interface has been rewritten to a considerable extent and
  should be more user-friendly.

# OTHER

## Miscellaneous Changes and Fixes

The following
miscellaneous fixes and changes are included in LISTSERV 14.5.

* The site-level variable
  USE\_LSMTP\_MAIL\_MERGE is obsolete and deprecated as of this version. Sites
  that use it should use EMBEDDED\_MAIL\_MERGE instead.

* The original release of LISTSERV 14.4
  (and possibly earlier) used an incorrect MIME boundary in generated
  bounces. This has been fixed.

·
The LANGUAGE
template in a list's WWWTPL file did not always reset when the Language=
keyword setting was changed. This has been fixed.

·
LMail-formatted
"soft" bounces did not result in a SOFTBOUNCE record being written when
using NOLIST changelogs. This has been fixed.

* Maintenance
  expiration messages have been made more consistent.

* The
  new list deletion feature added in the original release of LISTSERV 14.4
  did not always delete the list's archive directory. This has been fixed.

* Nested
  HTML mail templates caused occasional problems. This has been fixed.

* It
  was possible for users to be spam-quarantined regardless of their
  whitelist status because LISTSERV's older anti-spam measures were being
  taken without reference to the whitelist. This has been changed in 14.5,
  and the old spam filter now goes through the whitelist before registering
  an event, which in turn is based on the combined score of both whitelist
  and blacklist in the same manner as with the new spam filter. However, as
  the old spam filter lacks a TO context or a bounce flag, only the FROM
  lists are checked.

# Important OS support information

L-Soft formally
supports FreeBSD (Intel) and Linux (S/390) since LISTSERV 14.0 (1.8e). A
comprehensive list of operating systems (and versions) under which LISTSERV is
supported can be found at:

<http://www.lsoft.com/products/listserv_os.asp>

**The following operating systems are no longer
supported**:

·
Windows NT 4.0

·
Windows 95/98/Me

·
BSDi (Intel)

·
IRIX (MIPS)

·
Solaris-x86
(Intel)

Sites running these
operating systems should migrate to a different operating system. Please
contact your sales representative for further information.

Sites running the
Windows 95 shareware should note that their licenses will not activate the
product under Windows XP. Please contact your sales representative for
alternatives if you are planning to upgrade to Windows XP (optionally you may
migrate to the LISTSERV Lite Free Edition). Sites running the Windows 95 Lite
Free Edition can simply upgrade to the Windows NT/2000/XP LISTSERV Lite Free
Edition. You may also elect to continue running LISTSERV under Windows
95/98/Me, but there will be no further new versions or fixes for that platform.

# ApplyingLISTSERV 14.5

**IMPORTANT: Install your LISTSERV 14.5 product LAK before upgrading!** A valid product LAK (License Activation Key)
with "REL=14.5" must be installed before upgrading or LISTSERV will
not start after the upgrade.

If you have not received a LISTSERV 14.5 product LAK, please contact
your sales representative or SALES@LSOFT.COM before upgrading!

To find out if you can upgrade to LISTSERV 14.5 with your current
license key, please issue a SHOW LICENSE command to LISTSERV and examine the response.
It will be similar to this:

License type:       Permanent

Expiration date:    None
- perpetual license

Maintenance until:  **1 March 2006**, serial number MNT-XYZ-1

Capacity:
Unlimited

Version:            **14.5**

Serial number:      XYZ-1

Build date:         15
Feb 2006

Your license key will be valid for the 14.5 upgrade if your current LAK
is for version **14.5 or higher.**

Sites running
LISTSERV 14.4 may use the LAK input tool in the Web Administration interface to
apply and check their new LAK before upgrading.

The installation
kits found on L-Soft's web site can be used either to install a new copy of
LISTSERV or to upgrade an existing installation. To download LISTSERV 14.5,
simply go to L-Soft's Web site and download an evaluation copy of LISTSERV or
LISTSERV Lite, then follow the installation instructions for your operating
system. The kits can be found at:

<http://www.lsoft.com/download/listserv.asp>

<http://www.lsoft.com/download/listservlite.asp>

###

### SPECIAL NOTES

1. This document
does not include upgrade instructions. Please see the installation guide
specific to your OS platform for upgrade instructions.

VMS:                <http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/vmsinst.html>

unix:                 <http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/unixinst.html>

Windows:          <http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/ntinst.html>

VM sites currently
at the 1.8e or 14.x level should download
ftp://ftp.lsoft.com/listserv/vm/upd145.hex and install it per the "Fixes
and Upgrades" section of ftp://ftp.lsoft.com/listserv/vm/00-read.me . VM
sites currently at the 1.8d or earlier level must first upgrade to 1.8e
(LISTSERV 14) before applying this level set fix.

2. The unix kit now
only requires a single download. You do not need to download a common.tar.Z file
as in previous versions, as those files are now included in the single
OS-specific installation file.

3. LISTSERV version
14.5 is available only for operating systems currently supported by L-Soft.
When browsing FTP.LSOFT.COM, you may find installation kits for other operating
systems, such as Ultrix or SunOS 4.x, but these kits will be based on older
versions and/or code bases. L-Soft no longer has development systems for
unsupported operating systems and is not in a position to compile LISTSERV 14.5
for these systems.

## LISTSERV contains multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the WA CGI script

#### Vulnerability Note VU#841132

Original Release Date: 2006-03-09 | Last Revised: 2006-03-09

---

### Overview

Several buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in LISTSERV. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| [L-Soft's LISTSERV](http://www.lsoft.com/products/listserv.asp) is an email list management software package. It includes a Web Archive and Administration (WA) interface that allows users to browse and search list archives, and list owners and site maintainers to perform a number of management tasks. Several buffer overflow errors were discovered in the WA CGI component. These vulnerabilities are reported to affect LISTSERV versions 14.3 and 14.4, including LISTSERV Lite and HPO on all supported platforms. The specific nature of the underlying vulnerabilities is unknown at this time, however the reporter has stated that additional technical details will be publicly released on 2006-06-03. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute code of their choosing with the permissions of the WA CGI program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  L-Soft has released version 14.5 of LISTSERV and LISTSERV Lite that contains a fix for these vulnerabilities. For more information please see the "[WA Security Alert](http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/1.8e/relnotes/LISTSERV14.5-Release-Notes.html#wasecurityalert)" featured in the software release notes. Users of these products are strongly urged to upgrade to this fixed version of the software. |
