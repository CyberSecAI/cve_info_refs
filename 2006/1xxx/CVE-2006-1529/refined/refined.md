  "CVE-2006-1529": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability potentially allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "A crash occurs in `js_FreeStack` related to the 'unknown protocol error' dialog.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash). Potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted page causing the 'unknown protocol error' dialog to appear.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to get a user to open the crafted page. Potentially an attacker-controlled server to load the page, or a MITM attack could redirect to the malicious content.",
      "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was identified through testing with IExploder. It is related to the handling of modal dialogs and networking errors. The test case shows a crash that occurs when the dialog is dismissed by the user after loading a document with an unsupported protocol. A separate testcase shows a similar crash relating to password-in-URL warnings. Valgrind logs indicate an invalid memory read after clicking OK on the dialog, pointing to memory corruption issues."

  "CVE-2006-1530": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability potentially allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.",
     "Root cause": "The `compareDocumentPosition` method, when used with E4X (ECMAScript for XML) objects, can cause a crash due to improper result handling and GC protection in `XPCWrappedJSClass::CallMethod`, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Lack of GC protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash). Potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Calling `compareDocumentPosition` with E4X object via crafted HTML. The issue stems from how XPConnect interacts with E4X and how the JS GC handles the resulting objects.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to get a user to open the crafted page containing E4X objects. No specific user interaction is needed other than loading the page.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability involves improper handling of JS values, GC hazards, and issues arising from wrapping E4X objects within XPConnect.  The empty XMLList returned by E4X for certain property gets was a major contributing factor. The fix included a rooting fix for the JS value and preventing XPConnect from wrapping E4X objects, as well as a fix for a related issue: Bug 327697."

  "CVE-2006-1531": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability potentially allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how the layout engine handles listbox/listitem elements when `display: table-cell` is applied, specifically in `nsListBoxBodyFrame` when removing child frames.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (crash). Potential arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted XUL code with listbox/listitem and display: table-cell. Visiting a page with this particular combination causes a crash.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to get a user to open the specially crafted XUL page.",
      "Additional Information": "The root cause is that the listbox's OnContentRemoved notification logic was called for a child frame which wasn't an actual child of the listboxbody but a child of an anonymous table. This led to calling destroy() on a frame which wasn't part of the listboxbody.  The fix was to check that child is actually a direct child before calling RemoveChildFrame in OnContentRemoved."
