How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

    The function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0296

    XULDocument.persist() did not validate the attribute name,
    allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML and JavaScript code
    into localstore.rdf that would be read and acted upon during
    startup.  [MFSA-2006-05]

CVE-2006-0748

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative reported that an invalid and nonsensical ordering of
    table-related tags can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    [MFSA-2006-27]

CVE-2006-0749

    A particular sequence of HTML tags can cause memory corruption
    that can be exploited to exectute arbitary code.  [MFSA-2006-18]

CVE-2006-1727

    Georgi Guninski reported two variants of using scripts in an XBL

    could be used to steal confidential information.  [MFSA-2006-09]

CVE-2006-1742

    Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not
    properly handle temporary variables, which might allow remote
    attackers to trigger operations on freed memory and cause memory
    corruption, causing memory corruption.  [MFSA-2006-10]

CVE-2006-1790

    A regression fix that could lead to memory corruption allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-12**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow attacks ranging from
execution of script code with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Firefox. Versions
1.0.8 and 1.5.0.2 were released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages that would
leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with
elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other information
from web pages, and spoof content. Some of these vulnerabilities might
even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
browser user.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.8"
```

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200605-09**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Thunderbird allow attacks ranging from
script execution with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is the next-generation mail client from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Thunderbird.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious emails that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with elevated
privileges, steal local files or other information from emails, and
spoof content. Some of these vulnerabilities might even be exploited to
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Thunderbird.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.0.8"
```

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the ALPHA
architecture yet. Users of Mozilla Thunderbird on ALPHA should consider
unmerging it until such a version is available.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-17

## cross-site scripting through window.controllers

Announced
April 13, 2006
Reporter
shutdown
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.8
* Firefox 1.5
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.13
* SeaMonkey 1
* Thunderbird 1.0.8
* Thunderbird 1.5

### Description

shutdown demonstrated how to use the window.controllers array
to bypass same-origin protections, allowing a malicious site to
inject script into content from another site. This could allow
the malicious page to steal information such as cookies or
passwords from the other site, or perform transactions on the user's
behalf if the user were already logged in.

Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a version containing the fix.

### References

Exploit code and details embargoed during the active update period.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-18**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Suite allow attacks ranging from script
execution with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Suite. Version
1.7.13 was released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages or emails that
would leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code
with elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other
information from web pages or emails, and spoof content. Some of these
vulnerabilities might even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the user running the client.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.13"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.13"
```

Confirming, throwing Johnny's way. Can't "get" a controller ("Permission denied to create wrapper for object of class UnnamedClass") but this testcase shows you can easily substitute your own.
What are the legitimate uses of this object from untrusted web content? I can't find more than stub documentation on the web, is anyone actually using this? If not maybe we could hide the whole object.Assignee: general → jstStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueFlags: blocking1.8rc1+Flags: blocking1.7.13+Flags: blocking-aviary1.0.8+Whiteboard: [sg:high] XSS, worse?

To elaborate on what's going on here a bit... This isn't window.controller's fault, that's only used to get a double-wrapped JS object. The testcase relies on the fact that xpconnect doesn't do the "right" security check when calling a method on a double-wrapped JS object. The check that XPConnect does is to check if the caller can call method (or get/set) on the double-wrapped JS object, but in this case the double-wrapped JS object is from a different origin than the actual callee (which XPConnect finds on the proto chain), which is the prototype that has been set to a window object from a different origin. The patch in this bug blocks the hole by preventing setting an object's prototype to an object from a different origin. That check was already done, but it was broken and checked the wrong thing...Status: NEW → ASSIGNEDOS: Windows 98 → AllHardware: PC → AllTarget Milestone: --- → mozilla1.8rc1

Current testcase no longer works on firefox pacifica-trunk/2005102417.
But, the problem is not fixed yet.
Steps:
1. load "about:blank" into the frame.
2. link \_\_proto\_\_ chain of the object to be double-wrapped.
3. load the target (victim) site into the frame.
This way, you can bypass the security check.

Attached patch

[XPConnect fix.](attachment.cgi?id=200806&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=200806&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=313373&attachment=200806)

This patch makes xpconnect do the right thing in cases like this. Right now, in this case (calling a method on a doubly wrapped object that's implemented by a wrapped native on the doubly wrapped object's prototype) we'll end up bypassing the code that forwards the call to the original JS object and instead calling directly on the wrapped native, which bypasses security checks etc. With this change, a method call (or property get/set) on a doubly wrapped JS object always ends up going through XPConnect's forwarding mechansim (calling through to the nsXPCWrappedJS for the original object). That stops this exploit, early on even since the xpconnect method calling code (which calls the method on the original object) gets interrupted by a failing resolve call when looking up the method. The reason for the failing resolve is that the security manager stops the resolve (through security checks in DOM classinfo).

Is this a needed change for this bug? (Do we have test coverage for

I would really really like a test case for this that we can automate well. r=shaver, because I think it'll fix it, but it's a \_huge\_ change to take on the branch right now. (It may still be the minimal change that will fix it, but it makes my tummy feel funny, and I don't think it's because I'm in love with jst.)

XPConnect fix.
sr=me, and unlike shaver I am more relaxed about a little harmless else-after return elimination -- but it could wait for the trunk, for sure.
BTW, there is at least one guy (Garrett?) testing ActiveX controls, which use IDispatch. dbradley patched a regression found by this guy recently.
Good fix, there is usally a single "funnel" in XPConnect in which to make a fix -- the trick is finding the right funnel in the forest! ;-)

Attached patch

[Updated XPConnect fix.](attachment.cgi?id=200824&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=200824&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=313373&attachment=200824)

Same thing with the comments cleaned up. I'm more than happy to leave the else-after-return out of this change for the branch.

The demo demonstrates XSS, which is enough to steal cookies, steal passwords, steal information from intranet servers, and defeat CSRF protection on most sites.
Like most XSS holes, this hole can be combined with any hole that lets a site load chrome in a frame to create an arbitrary code execution exploit. (I verified that this XSS hole can be used this way by commenting out two lines in the testcase that load pages in the iframe, changing "document.cookie" to "Components.classes", and using DOM Inspector to load about:config in the frame before clicking the link.)
I don't understand the bug or exploit well enough to say whether this bug can be used to do more than XSS without combining it with another hole.

moving out to the 1.8 rc2 ride-along candidate list. We'll consider taking this if we do an RC2. Brendan and Shaver, can you guys help us understand what's risky (or not so risky) about this patch and what kind of testing we'd want to feel good about shipping this on the branch so soon before the release.Flags: blocking1.8rc1? → blocking1.8rc2?
