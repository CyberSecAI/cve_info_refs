How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

|  | |

Clicking <html:a> link in XUL document makes a browser window invisible.
XUL-DOC:
<window xmlns="<http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul>">
<p xmlns="<http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>">
<a href="about:blank">a</a>
</p>
</window>
1. w = open("XUL-DOC");
2. Click the link on XUL-DOC. Then about:blank is loaded.
3. Move mouse. Then XUL-DOC's browser window becomes invisible.
4. w.history.back();
Then the browser UI is still invisible, but XUL-DOC's content elements are
displayed onto the browser UI.
Note:
1.5.0.1 and trunk are affected. 1.0.x is not affected.
When bfcache is disabled, this bug is not reproducible.
On Linux, this bug is not reproducible. (I've tested on Windows XP and Linux.)
This bug could be used to exploit. For example, if an attacker created a
JavaScript game page and could convince a user to drag and drop two links
(about:config and javascript:...) onto the invisible Bookmarks Toolbar, and
click those bookmarks in sequence, then an attacker could run arbitrary code.

I don't see the problem with "simple testcase", but "This is used to open main xul" is definitely showing the problem on Linux. I'm guessing that we're messing with the wrong widgets, but not sure. Bryner, can you reproduce this? Do you have time to look into it?

I see the problem on Linux with the testcase in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=327014#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Clicking <html:a> link in XUL document makes a browser window invisible"), fwiw. I don't see the Windows thing, but I get a transparent window for a bit, then lots of asserts and chrome painting is busted....

Attached patch

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=327014&attachment=214273)

Here's what causes the bug to happen:
- we cache the xul document into bfcache
- when you move the mouse, we get a reflow on the old document (this is suspicious and it seems like we shouldn't)
- during reflow, the ContainerFrame code sees a XUL document with no parent (because it's been unhooked) and no background specified, and thinks we must be a toplevel chrome window that wants to be translucent.
- the translucency bit is set on the native window and it goes poof
It looks like things don't work quite the same way on gtk which is why this bug doesn't appear on Linux. Many thanks to roc for helpling me debug.

Oops, I hit submit before I meant to.
This patch fixes the immediate problem by ensuring that the document has a container (that is, a docshell) before allowing it to be set as translucent. We should also investigate why a reflow is happening on the cached document. I'll file a separate bug on that .

I filed [bug 329580](/show_bug.cgi?id=329580 "NEW - reflows on bfcached documents") on the reflow problem. I referenced the testcase from this bug, and therefore also marked that one security-sensitive. If anyone feels strongly that the reflow bug should \_not\_ be security-sensitive (and I can certainly see why we'd want it not to be), we should come up with a testcase for it that's not so obviously exploitable.

The problem is that SetWindowTranslucency needs to search up the window hierarchy internally to find the "right" window. I'll probably fix this during view removal/widget wrangling.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-29

## Spoofing with translucent windows

Announced
April 13, 2006
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.5.0.2
* SeaMonkey 1.0.1

### Description

An interaction between XUL content windows and the new faster history
mechanism in Firefox 1.5 caused those windows to become translucent.
This could be used to construct spoofs that could trick users into
interacting with browser UI they can't see. It's possible a
clever game-type presentation could persuade an unsuspicious
user into some combination of actions that would result in
running the attacker's code.

Firefox 1.0 and the Mozilla Suite 1.7 are not vulnerable.

### Workaround

Disable the faster back/forward history:

1. Enter "about:config" into the location bar and hit Enter
2. Enter "sessionhistory" into the "Filter" text box
3. Double-click on `browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers`
4. Change the default "-1" to "0" and hit the OK button
