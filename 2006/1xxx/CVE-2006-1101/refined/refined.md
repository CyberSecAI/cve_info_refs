{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "The sgetstr(), getint() functions, and instructions that call them do not check the length of the input data, potentially leading to memory access beyond allocated regions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Improper memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) on both server and client due to invalid memory access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted data to the server or client.",
      "Exploiting the SV_EXT tag in the server where a 32-bit number is read from input data without checking the length, leading to a read loop that can access unallocated memory."

  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
        "root_cause": "The game does not sanitize the map name, allowing directory traversal and forcing the client to load any file, which can crash the client.",

          "Directory Traversal",
          "Improper Input Sanitization"
