Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2006-1306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Microsoft Excel processes malformed OBJECT records within an Excel file. Specifically, when Excel attempts to process a malformed OBJECT record, it can lead to memory corruption, which can then be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation of the structure or length of the OBJECT record data within the Excel file, leading to a buffer overflow/memory corruption when parsing a malformed one.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting a specific, malicious OBJECT record, an attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who opens the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Reduced Impact for Limited User Rights:** Users with fewer user rights on the system will be less impacted, but still vulnerable to an attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker could send a malicious Excel file as an email attachment, tricking the user into opening it.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted Excel file which exploits the vulnerability if the user opens it. Compromised websites or sites accepting user-generated content are also potential attack vectors.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by simply opening a malformed excel file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafting Malicious Excel File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Excel file containing a malformed OBJECT record.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the victim to open the malicious file, either by sending it directly or by leading them to a website hosting the file.
- No special network access or credentials are required other than access to the target user via email or web.
