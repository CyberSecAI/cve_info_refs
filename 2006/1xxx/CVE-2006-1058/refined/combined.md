## Synopsis

Low: busybox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0244)

## Topic

Updated busybox packages that fix a security issue are now available.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

Busybox is a single binary which includes versions of a large number of
system commands, including a shell. This package can be useful for
recovering from certain types of system failures.

BusyBox did not use a salt when generating passwords. This made it
easier for local users to guess passwords from a stolen password file.
(CVE-2006-1058)

All users of busybox are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain a patch to resolve this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied. Use Red Hat
Network to download and update your packages. To launch the Red Hat
Update Agent, use the following command:

up2date

For information on how to install packages manually, refer to the
following Web page for the System Administration or Customization
guide specific to your system:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/>

busybox security update (RHSA-2007-0244)

Original Release Date: June 27, 2007

Last Revised: February 17, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-250

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Busybox is a utility that implements versions of common core UNIX
system
commands.

Busybox's password generation methods were found to not use a salt
when a
password was created. This could potentially allow for user passwords
to be
more easily discovered from a password file. The Common Vulnerabilities
and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1058](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1058) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0244.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with busybox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.01, 4.1 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of busybox, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network
access to the server. This restriction should be enforced through the
use of
physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was
installed and
then follow that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:
