{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "phpBB HTML template files are parsed and executed as PHP code without proper filtering.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure parsing of template files, allowing arbitrary PHP code execution.",
    "Insufficient filtering of template file content.",
     "Vulnerability in includes/template.php using `(.*)` pattern instead of `([0-9a-z_.-]+)` to match BEGIN and END statements."
      "Vulnerability in includes/bbcode.php evaling the template."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Modifying or injecting malicious PHP code into phpBB template files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have access to modify template files within the phpBB installation (e.g. by having access to the template administration or uploading files).",
    "More details": "The vulnerability is present in how phpBB parses HTML template files. Template files are parsed and executed as PHP code, and inadequate filtering allows an attacker to insert malicious PHP code. In `overall_header.tpl`, any code after the first `;` is parsed as PHP. In `bbcode.tpl`, any code outside `<!-- -->` is parsed as PHP.  The vulnerability can be resolved by using the correct regex for parsing the template files and by not using eval on the bbcode.tpl template."
