Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-1756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `admin.php` script is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** The "Administration Area" script lacks any authentication mechanism, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Failure to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Missing authentication controls on the administrative interface, making it accessible to anyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to data leakage, modification, or deletion. It could also be used to escalate privileges within the application or compromise the underlying database server.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain full administrative control over the application, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the `admin.php` script with crafted SQL queries.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** By directly accessing the `admin.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable MD News application. The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL injection query.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker only needs to know the name/path of the admin script to access the administrative interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is MD News version 1.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered on 2006-04-05.
*   The vendor has not responded to the vulnerability report and no patch was released.
*   Proof-of-concept exploit code is available
* The provided content includes a sample SQL injection payload: `http://[host]/admin.php?action=full&id=-1 union select 1,2,3,4,5`
