Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-1134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw.
*   The `$parent` variable in the `post.php` script is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. This is possible because the `$parent` variable is directly used in the SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   This can lead to data breaches (confidentiality impact) by accessing sensitive information.
*   Data modification (integrity impact), could add, modify or delete data.
*   Service disruption (availability impact).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the HTTP request to `post.php` script.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack is carried out by manipulating the `$parent` variable, likely passed through the `reply` parameter in the URL. The provided exploit example demonstrates a manipulated `reply` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is required to craft the injection payload.
*  **`magic_quotes_gpc` Off:**  The server's `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be off for the exploit to work.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** CyBoards PHP Lite version 1.25
*   **Status:** The vulnerability was unpatched at the time of reporting.
*   **PoC/Exploit:** A proof-of-concept exploit is available.
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.1/10, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
*   **CWE:** CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'))
*   **Exploit Example:** `http://[host]/post.php?board=1&reply=999'%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19/*`
