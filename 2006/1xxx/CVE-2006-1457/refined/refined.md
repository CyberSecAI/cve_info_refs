{
  "CVE-2006-1457": {
    "Description": "Apple Safari fails to properly handle archive files that contain symbolic links, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Safari automatically opens 'safe' file types, including archive files, and extracts them. When an archive contains a symbolic link, Safari will automatically execute the link's target.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of symbolic links within archive files.",
      "Automatic execution of extracted 'safe' files."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious archive file containing symbolic links is downloaded and automatically opened by Safari.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious archive file on a server and induce a user to download it using Safari."
