Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Lurker's mechanism for specifying configuration files. This mechanism is susceptible to being overridden by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Configuration File Override:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can manipulate Lurker to override the intended configuration file with a file of their choosing.
- **Information Disclosure:** Lurker includes sections of unparsed configuration files in its output, which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information within those files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Reading:** By overriding the configuration file, an attacker can force Lurker to read any file on the system that the www-data user has permission to access. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, such as configuration settings, system files, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger this vulnerability over a network.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate Lurker to specify an alternate configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Lurker application via the network.
- **Lurker Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how Lurker's configuration file mechanism works in order to manipulate it.

**Summary:**
CVE-2006-1062 is a vulnerability in Lurker where the configuration file loading mechanism can be overridden. This allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files accessible to the web server user due to Lurker outputting unparsed content of specified configuration files.
