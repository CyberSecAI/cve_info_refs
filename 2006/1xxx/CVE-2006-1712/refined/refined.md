    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input used in generating the 'action' parameter within the 'private.py' script. Specifically, the 'action' variable, which is derived from the URL, was not properly escaped before being included in the HTML output.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper Output Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'action' parameter. This code would be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they access the private archive page. The attacker could potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the 'action' parameter, which is then reflected in the generated HTML content.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that will be accessed by users of the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any prior authentication."
