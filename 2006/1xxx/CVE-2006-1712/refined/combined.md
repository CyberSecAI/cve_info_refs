Hi all,

Mailman 2.1.8rc1 was released for the final test of 2.1.8.

Important: This is not only a release candidate but also include a fix
for a cross-site scripting bug found in 2.1.7.  All sites running
previous versions are adviced to upgrade to 2.1.8(rc1).  I am going to
release the final by the next weekend if nothing serious happens.

Please download it from Sourceforge file area:
   <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103>

Cheers,

Tokio
---------------------------------------------------
Here is a history of user visible changes to Mailman.

2.1.8rc1 (07-Apr-2006)

   Security

     - A cross-site scripting hole in the private archive script of 2.1.7
       has been closed.  Thanks to Moritz Naumann for its discovery.

   Bug fixes and other patches

     - Bouncers support added: 'unknown user', Microsoft SMTPSVC,
Prodigy.net
       and several others.

     - Updated email library to 2.5.7 which will encode payload into
qp/base64
       upon setting.  This enabled backing out the scrubber related patches
       including 'X-Mailman-Scrubbed' header in 2.1.7.

     - Fix SpamDetect.py potential hold/reject loop problem.

     - A warning message from email package to the stderr can cause error
       in Logging because stderr may be detached from the process during
       the qrunner run.  We chose not to output errors to stderr but to
       the logs/error if the process is running under mailmanctl subprocess.

     - DKIM header cleansing was separated from Cleanse.py and added to
       -owner messages too.

     - Fixes: Lose Topics when go directly to topics URL (1194419).
       UnicodeError running bin/arch (1395683).  edithtml.py missing import
       (1400128).  Bad escape in cleanarch.  Wrong timezone in list archive
       index pages (1433673).  bin/arch fails with TypeError (1430236).
       Subscription fails with some Language combinations (1435722).
       Postfix delayed notification not recognized (863989).  2.1.7 (VERP)
       mistakes delay notice for bounce (1421285).  show_qfiles: 'str'
       object has no attribute 'as_string' (1444447).  Utils.get_domain()
       wrong if VIRTUAL_HOST_OVERVIEW off (1275856).

   Miscellaneous

     - Brad Knowles' mailman daily status report script updated to 0.0.16.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
