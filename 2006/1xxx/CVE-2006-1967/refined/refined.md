{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CGI Calendar application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'year' parameter when constructing web pages, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious URL with a script in the 'year' parameter of the 'index.cgi' or 'viewday.cgi' script."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely. The attack complexity is considered high because the attacker needs to specifically target the vulnerable parameter and inject malicious code within it."
