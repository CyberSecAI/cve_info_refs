  "CVE-2006-1308": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Excel that results from the processing of a malformed FNGROUPCOUNT value file. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Excel file that could allow remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered when Excel processes a specially crafted Excel file with a malformed FNGROUPCOUNT value. This leads to memory corruption, allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Malformed FNGROUPCOUNT value"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. With administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer privileges would be less impacted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: Attacker hosts a webpage with malicious Excel file which is opened by victim.",
      "Email-based attack: Attacker sends a malicious Excel file to the victim and persuades them to open it."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file and either host it on a webpage or send it to the victim via email or other means. They also need to convince the victim to open the file."
