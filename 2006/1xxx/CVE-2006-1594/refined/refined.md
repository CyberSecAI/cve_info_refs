    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_39ec6be3_20250124_215420.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `scormExport.inc.php` file of Claroline, where the `includePath` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for arbitrary remote file inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized input",
        "Remote file inclusion vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET request to a vulnerable `scormExport.inc.php` file.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the target system. The `register_globals` and `allow_url_fopen` PHP settings must be enabled on the target server for successful exploitation through a remote URL. Alternatively, if `magic_quotes_gpc` is off, the attacker can inject code into server logs and include them using a null byte injection."
