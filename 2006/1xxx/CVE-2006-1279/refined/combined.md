# CVE-2006-1280

Subject: writes session files insecurely to /tmp; symlink attacks and data exposure
Date: Sun, 12 Mar 2006 13:07:11 -0500
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=356555;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: libcgi-session-perl
Version: 4.03-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hole 1:

CGI::Session with its default Driver::File contains this insecure code:

$self->{Directory} ||= File::Spec->tmpdir();

my $directory   = $self->{Directory};
my $path        = File::Spec->catfile($directory, $file);

unless ( sysopen(FH, $path, O_RDONLY) ) {

File::Spec->tmpdir default to /tmp, and this is where CGI::Session
defaults to storing its temporary files. Therefore, it writes files to
/tmp without the O_EXCL flag set when opening them.

This makes it vulnerable to symlink attacks when used with these default
settings, provided that you can guess what session id will be generated
before time. Of course session ids are supposed to be hard to guess,
that's the point of them, but a failure mode that includes overwriting
arbitrary files is a bit worse than would be expected. I suggest adding
| O_EXCL to close this hole.

Hole 2:

Notice that the sysopen above does not include permissions. So with a
standard umask, the session file defaults to world readable, and anyone
on the machine can get access to all the session keys and whatever is
secured via them, and whatever else is stored in the session files. I
can see no reason not to pass a mode of 0400 to the sysopen above.

Setting umask(077) before creating the session object will work around
this problem. I know that perl's philisophy is to respect the umask by
default, but I think that in this case a secure default is more
important.

Hole 3:

Driver::db_file has documentation that falsely claims to write to
/tmp/cgisessions.db by default, when in fact it seems to default to
writing to ./cgisess.db. If your cgi script is ~/public_html/my.cgi,
then it will unexpectedly write to ~/public_html/cgisess.db, which will
be publically accessible, since it writes the file mode 644. Remote
users can then download the file and take over other's sessions.

Hole 4:

If you write the file somewhere else, then it's still mode
644, so local users can read all the session data from it.

Setting umask(077) before creating the session object is a way to
work around the permissions issue.

Hole 5:

If you use Driver::db_file and specify a FileName for the file (like the
example does in the man page), you can get it to write to /tmp, which is
again subject to symlink attacks.

There's an attack possible the first time the file is created, but a
better attack is against the .lck file used for locking, which is
written to the same directory, and which is opened without O_EXCL.

Just start creating a symlink /tmp/cgisessions.db.lck -> /some/file in a
loop, hit the CGI script that uses CGI::Sessions a few times until you win
the race, and voila, /some/file has been zeroed.
/var/log/apache2/access.log might be a good candidate for /some/file..

Hole 6:

Driver::sqlite writes to /tmp/sessions.sqlt by default. I have not
checked to see if DBI->connect opens the file with O_EXCL, but I doubt
it, so again we have symlink attacks.

Hole 7:

Also we again have the situation where an attacker can create the file
in /tmp full of malicious data that exploits any holes in squlite,
and wait for someone to use Driver::db_file for the first time. I have
not checked to see if it creates world readable files too, but I'm
guessing it does.

Should be fixed.

I agree. Should be fixed.

I changed the default behaviour to respect the documentation, and fixed
the umask.

Don't know how to handle this right now, and not sure this is
CGI::Session bug, maybe a DBI one.

Maybe this could be fixed by having CGI::Session create/open the file
with O_EXCL before using DBI. Assuming an empty file would not confuse
DBI, this would prevent attacks. Alternatively, it could safely create a
temporary directory and tell DBI to write to a file in there.

I think this bug should probably be reopened to make sure these last
security holes don't get forgotten.

... and [CVE-2006-1280](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1280) as well. -1279 for the symlink attack, and -1280
for the improper permissions (information disclosure).

Thanks,
