{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CGI::Session module creates temporary files in insecure ways, making them vulnerable to symlink attacks and information disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file creation using `File::Spec->tmpdir()` which defaults to `/tmp` without using the `O_EXCL` flag. This allows symlink attacks where an attacker can create a symlink with the same name as a temporary file before the script creates it, leading to arbitrary file overwrites.",
      "The session files created are world-readable by default because file permissions are not explicitly set when the file is opened with `sysopen`, and umask is respected by default.",
      "The `Driver::db_file` module has documentation that falsely claims it writes to `/tmp/cgisessions.db` by default, while it actually defaults to writing to `./cgisess.db`, potentially within the web-accessible directory, and is created world-readable.",
      "The `.lck` lock file created by `Driver::db_file` is also vulnerable to symlink attacks as it is created without `O_EXCL`.",
      "The `Driver::sqlite` module defaults to writing to `/tmp/sessions.sqlt`, possibly vulnerable to symlink attacks if `DBI->connect` does not use `O_EXCL`.",
      "An attacker can create malicious data in a file at /tmp that will be used when `Driver::db_file` is used for the first time, potentially exploiting any holes within sqlite itself.",
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can overwrite arbitrary files, gain access to session keys, and potentially compromise other users' sessions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local symlink attacks on temporary files.",
      "Information disclosure through world-readable session files.",
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Local user access is required to exploit symlink attacks and read world-readable files. Ability to guess session IDs might be needed for symlink race condition attacks."
