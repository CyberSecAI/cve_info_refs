How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You can use onerror event handler to circumvent eval()'s principal checks
and can execute arbitary code with elevated privilege. See the testcase.

Attached patch

[maybe wrong patch](attachment.cgi?id=198747&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=198747&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=311403&attachment=198747)

So the basic issue here is that when we compile the outer eval, we don't have a
scripted caller, so we compile it with NULL principals. From then on, the
scripted caller of the second eval also has no principals, so any security
checks that we would do succeed trivially. This patch gives the outer eval the
principals of the |this| object, which in the case of onerror is the content
window.

I checked that into the trunk yesterday. Just want to emphasize that we should

setTimeout can be used to force the same issue on 1.0.x.
setTimeout(eval, 0, code, obj);
When eval is called from timeout, scripted caller is null.

Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla
Firefox.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2005-4134

    Web pages with extremely long titles cause subsequent launches of
    the browser to appear to "hang" for up to a few minutes, or even
    crash if the computer has insufficient memory.  [MFSA-2006-03]

CVE-2006-0292

    The Javascript interpreter does not properly dereference objects,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
    execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0293

    The function allocation code allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-01]

CVE-2006-0296

    XULDocument.persist() did not validate the attribute name,
    allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary XML and JavaScript code
    into localstore.rdf that would be read and acted upon during
    startup.  [MFSA-2006-05]

CVE-2006-0748

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative reported that an invalid and nonsensical ordering of
    table-related tags can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    [MFSA-2006-27]

CVE-2006-0749

    A particular sequence of HTML tags can cause memory corruption
    that can be exploited to exectute arbitary code.  [MFSA-2006-18]

CVE-2006-1727

    Georgi Guninski reported two variants of using scripts in an XBL
    control to gain chrome privileges when the page is viewed under
    "Print Preview".under "Print Preview".  [MFSA-2006-25]

CVE-2006-1728

    "shutdown" discovered that the crypto.generateCRMFRequest method
    can be used to run arbitrary code with the privilege of the user
    running the browser, which could enable an attacker to install
    malware.  [MFSA-2006-24]

CVE-2006-1729

    Claus Jørgensen reported that a text input box can be pre-filled
    with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control,
    allowing a malicious website to steal any local file whose name
    they can guess.  [MFSA-2006-23]

CVE-2006-1730

    An anonymous researcher for TippingPoint and the Zero Day
    Initiative discovered an integer overflow triggered by the CSS
    letter-spacing property, which could be exploited to execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-22]

CVE-2006-1731

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that some internal functions return
    prototypes instead of objects, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  [MFSA-2006-19]

CVE-2006-1732

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to bypass same-origin
    protections, allowing a malicious site to inject script into
    content from another site, which could allow the malicious page to
    steal information such as cookies or passwords from the other
    site, or perform transactions on the user's behalf if the user
    were already logged in.  [MFSA-2006-17]

CVE-2006-1733

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that the compilation scope of privileged
    built-in XBL bindings is not fully protected from web content and
    can still be executed which could be used to execute arbitrary
    JavaScript, which could allow an attacker to install malware such
    as viruses and password sniffers.  [MFSA-2006-16]

CVE-2006-1734

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to access an internal
    function object which could then be used to run arbitrary
    JavaScriptcode with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.
    [MFSA-2006-15]

CVE-2006-1735

    It is possible to create JavaScript functions that would get
    compiled with the wrong privileges, allowing an attacker to run
    code of their choice with full permissions of the user running the
    browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses.

CVE-2006-1736

    It is possible to trick users into downloading and saving an
    executable file via an image that is overlaid by a transparent
    image link that points to the executable.  [MFSA-2006-13]

CVE-2006-1737

    An integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary bytecode via JavaScript
    with a large regular expression.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1738

    An unspecified vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1739

    Certain Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can cause an out-of-bounds
    array write and buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of
    service and the possible execution of arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

CVE-2006-1740

    It is possible for remote attackers to spoof secure site
    indicators such as the locked icon by opening the trusted site in
    a popup window, then changing the location to a malicious site.
    [MFSA-2006-12]

CVE-2006-1741

    "shutdown" discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary
    JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to
    suspend an event handler while a new page is being loaded.  This
    could be used to steal confidential information.  [MFSA-2006-09]

CVE-2006-1742

    Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not
    properly handle temporary variables, which might allow remote
    attackers to trigger operations on freed memory and cause memory
    corruption, causing memory corruption.  [MFSA-2006-10]

CVE-2006-1790

    A regression fix that could lead to memory corruption allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200605-09**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Thunderbird allow attacks ranging from
script execution with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is the next-generation mail client from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla
Thunderbird.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious emails that would leverage
these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with elevated
privileges, steal local files or other information from emails, and
spoof content. Some of these vulnerabilities might even be exploited to
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running Thunderbird.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.0.8"
```

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the ALPHA
architecture yet. Users of Mozilla Thunderbird on ALPHA should consider
unmerging it until such a version is available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You can use setTimeout() to circumvent eval()'s principal checks
and can execute arbitary code with elevated privilege.
This one can exploit 1.0.x versions too.
Probably be fixed by [bug 311403](/show_bug.cgi?id=311403 "VERIFIED FIXED - chrome XBL method.eval + onerror handler allows arbitary code execution").

This should be fixed on trunk unless there's a similar exploit involving |new
Script|. Leaving open for that possibility.Depends on: [311403](/show_bug.cgi?id=311403 "VERIFIED FIXED - chrome XBL method.eval + onerror handler allows arbitary code execution")

Blake, are we done with this on the 1.8 branch then? If so, can you please add
the fixed1.8 keyword. If not, can you help us make sure that it does get fixed
on the branch (with the fix for the other bug?) Thanks.

Asa, the plan right now is to land all of the security fixing that's been going
on in one fell swoop, so this is not yet fixed on the 1.8 branch.

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-12**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow attacks ranging from
execution of script code with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.8** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the
Mozilla project.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Firefox. Versions
1.0.8 and 1.5.0.2 were released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages that would
leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code with
elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other information
from web pages, and spoof content. Some of these vulnerabilities might
even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the
browser user.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.0.8"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.0.8"
```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-14

## Privilege escalation via XBL.method.eval

Announced
April 13, 2006
Reporter
shutdown
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Mozilla Suite, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 1.0.8
* Firefox 1.5
* Mozilla Suite 1.7.13
* SeaMonkey 1
* Thunderbird 1.0.8
* Thunderbird 1.5

### Description

Using the eval associated with methods of an XBL binding it was possible
to create JavaScript functions that would get compiled with the wrong
privileges, allowing the attacker to run code of their choice with the
full permission of the user running the browser. This
could be used to install spyware or viruses.

Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox
and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not
the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until you can upgrade to a fixed version.

### References

Exploit code and details embargoed during the active update period.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Mozilla products vulnerable to privilege escalation via XBL.method.eval

#### Vulnerability Note VU#813230

Original Release Date: 2006-04-17 | Last Revised: 2006-04-17

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the way Mozilla products and derivative programs handle certain XBL methods could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Mozilla browser and derived products include support for the Extensible Bindings Language (XBL), a markup language that defines special new elements, or "bindings" for Mozilla's XML-based User interface Language (XUL) widgets and HTML elements. A vulnerability has been discovered in the way that Mozilla and derived products handle some methods of XBL bindings. [Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-14](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-14.html) states the following:  Using the eval associated with methods of an XBL binding it was possible to create JavaScript functions that would get compiled with the wrong privileges, allowing the attacker to run code of their choice with the full permission of the user running the browser. This could be used to install spyware or viruses.  *Note:* Thunderbird shares the JavaScript engine with Firefox and could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in mail. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to run code of their choosing on an affected system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the permissions of the user running the vulnerable program. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**  The Mozilla Foundation has published [Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2006-14](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-14.html) in response to this issue. Users are encouraged to review this advisory and upgrade to the fixed versions of the products it describes. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**  Users, particularly those who are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of the software, are encouraged to disable JavaScript in the affected program. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Suite: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200604-18**

Several vulnerabilities in Mozilla Suite allow attacks ranging from script
execution with elevated privileges to information leaks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/mozilla** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

| Package | **www-client/mozilla-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.13** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.13** |

### Background

The Mozilla Suite is a popular all-in-one web browser that
includes a mail and news reader.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in Mozilla Suite. Version
1.7.13 was released to fix them.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft malicious web pages or emails that
would leverage these issues to inject and execute arbitrary script code
with elevated privileges, steal local files, cookies or other
information from web pages or emails, and spoof content. Some of these
vulnerabilities might even be exploited to execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the user running the client.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Suite users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-1.7.13"
```

All Mozilla Suite binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-bin-1.7.13"
```

You can retrieve the Function constructor from XBL compilation scope by:
boundElement.xblMethod.eval.call(null, "Function")
Retrieved constructor can be used to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges if xblMethod is defined in the chrome XBL file.

The indirectCall case requires another subsumes test, to check whether the
scriped caller of indirect-eval should have access to the scope object
parameter, which in this bug's testcase comes from call or apply walking up
eval's scope chain to the chrome compilation global object for the XBL.

(In reply to [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=311025#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - chrome XBL method.eval.call exposes privileged Function constructor"))
I've applied the proposed patch and tested.
That prevents this:
var fctor = bound.stop.eval.call(null, "Function");
But, that does not prevent this:
var fctor = bound.stop.eval.call(1, "Function", bound.stop.eval);

- }
+ ok = CheckEvalAccess(cx, obj, principals);
+ if (!ok)
+ goto out;
}
Shouldn't this code be the following?
ok = CheckEvalAccess(cx, scopeobj, principals);

Yes it should, duh. I thought I'd checked that when I reviewed, but apparently I
missed it :-(.
When I make that change locally, your second testcase is also (correctly) blocked.

obj is wrong here, don't you mean scopeobj? If you do mean scopeobj, then
there's no point testing whether caller->script->principals subsumes
caller->scopeChain's object principals, since that must be the case (we could
assert it, but not here -- probably where we set up a frame -- and it would
slow down DEBUG builds mightily, so do it only if DEBUG\_iamslow).

Not sure we need this patch either -- figure out whether you meant obj above,
or scopeobj.
The consolidation via js\_CheckEvalAccess would be cool, I think.

Actually, I don't think that Script needs this patch (shutdown and moz\_bug\_r\_a4
should speak up now if I'm wrong!). Marking this bug as fixed on the trunk. I'm

This patch is the best-of all of the security fixes that have gone in lately.
It should make eval and script unassailable (until proven differently, of
course).

Which bugs does the "rolled-up patch" fix apart from this one?
I assume nobody is porting this to 1.7 (gives more failures than applied hunks)?
