---------------------------------------------------
o Description:
=============
The current releases, Amaya 9.5, is available for Linux, Windows and
now MacOS X (see screenshot). It supports HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, XHTML
Basic, XHTML 1.1, HTTP 1.1, MathML 2.0, many CSS 2 features, and
includes SVG support (transformation, transparency, and SMIL animation).
See the "Amaya Overview" page [1] for more details.
o Stack overflow:
================
Both of the two below posted code snippets (in fact there are dozens
of possible snippets but all of them trigger the same bug) force
Amaya 9.4 to crash:
>
> [...]
>
After the first glance at the generated error report and respectively
the ASM code during the access violation I thought I came across a
heap based buffer overflow.
eax=000000f9 ebx=02ae8420 ecx=77bcec76 edx=41414141 esi=007b9420

004eddc3 5f pop edi
004eddc4 5e pop esi
004eddc5 5d pop ebp
After a second, more precise look, the evitable heap overflow turned
out to be a stack based overflow..
We are able to control the EIP:
>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

> 4242424c ?? ???
Online-demo:
http://morph3us.org/security/pen-testing/amaya/amaya-94-textarea-rows.html
In fact, sucessful exploitation of this vulnerability is not that easy
because non-text characters were modfified during parsing therefore you
have to find a place where to place the shellcode. Naturally you have
to avoid null bytes too because Amaya would stop parsing the attribute
value and the overflow would not get triggered.
o Disclosure Timeline:
=====================
21 Dec 05 - Vulnerability discovered.
21 Feb 06 - Vendor contacted.
23 Feb 06 - Vendor confirmed vulnerability.
08 Mar 06 - Vendor fixed vulnerability.
12 Apr 06 - Public release.
o Solution:
==========

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
