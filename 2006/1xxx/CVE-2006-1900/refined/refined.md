        "The application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. Input provided to the application is not validated leading to the overflow when processing the `textarea rows` attribute"

      "impact": "Remote code execution. The attacker can control the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer), which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
      "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious HTML page that contains an overly long `textarea rows` attribute. When this HTML page is opened in the vulnerable Amaya browser, it causes a stack buffer overflow.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to get the user to open the malicious HTML page in the vulnerable Amaya browser, which can be achieved by hosting it on a website or by sending it as an email attachment.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by an overly long 'rows' attribute in a textarea tag. Non-text characters were modified during parsing, requiring the attacker to carefully place shellcode in a way that avoids modification by the parser. The attacker must avoid null bytes in their shellcode because the parser will stop processing the attribute value upon encountering them, thus preventing the overflow."
