  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1593",
      "vuln_type": "Buffer Overflow",
      "root_cause": "The server copies the client-provided wad file name into a 256-byte buffer using strcpy() without proper length validation. The my_strupr function is intended to uppercase the filename, but it does not prevent the overflow if the original filename is longer than 256 bytes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when copying the client-provided wad filename.",
        "Use of strcpy() function without length limits."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the server by overwriting a return address, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote, via sending a specially crafted long wad file name during client connection.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the server password if the server is password-protected. Banning the attacker IP will not help in blocking the exploit."
    },
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1593",
      "vuln_type": "Invalid Memory Access",
        "root_cause": "The server uses an 8-bit number from the client to index into player slots or item arrays without proper bounds checking. If the client sends an invalid index, the server tries to access an invalid memory location.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of bounds checking when using client-provided 8-bit number to index into arrays.",
           "Direct memory access without validation."
      ],
      "impact": "Server crash due to invalid memory access.",
        "attack_vector": "Remote, in-game by sending crafted commands with invalid player slot or item indices.",
        "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs to successfully join the game which includes providing correct MD5 hashes of the wads, server password and not being banned to exploit this vulnerability"
