### Bug Description

The root password from the first user registred by Breezy can be found by any user by reading the file /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat

a quick

grep -r rootpassword /var

shows that the rootpassword is forgotten in cleartext by the installer on several occations

/var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat:Value: mypasswd

/var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat:Value: mypasswd

/var/log/debian-installer/cdebconf/questions.dat:Value: mypasswd

/var/log/debian-installer/cdebconf/questions.dat:Value: mypasswd

I can confirm this on Kubuntu Breezy.

What I will say is that this isn't the 'root' password that is in cleartext, but the user name/password that you created at install. After all, the root account is locked by default even though the user password will still let you get root privs with sudo.

Name: passwd/title

Template: passwd/title

Name: passwd/user-fullname

Template: passwd/user-fullname

Value: mfogtman

Name: passwd/user-password

Template: passwd/user-password

Value: <mypasswashere>

Name: passwd/user-password-again

Template: passwd/user-password-again

Value: <mypasswashere>

Name: passwd/username

Template: passwd/username

Value: mfogtman

this is quite serious since the default user is granted sudo rights, all i need to do is tu use this password to do a "sudo su-", then change the rootpassword to whatever i want and own the computer

even worse, this file might be left over in the the filesystem on people that upgrades from breezy 5.10, so saying its fixed in dapper is not a solution

people must be warned and adviced to delete these files asap

We need a security update that removes/patches this file.

This brings on a huge security problem that even a moderately knowledgeable admin can run into if the admin installs a ssh-server.

I failed to do this above, but here is a "formal" confirmation from me.

I can confirm this issue on my install, a new breezy install on ppc

all the directories in the path /var/log/installer/cdebconf are all chmod 755 owned root:root

The file questions.dat is chmod 644 owned root:root

I don't see how this is happening, because we deliberately db\_set those questions to empty after retrieving the password to avoid this problem. Nevertheless, I'll investigate at the earliest opportunity, and probably release a base-config update that gets rid of those fields.

This might be a help to those on a bug hunt:

I checked a computer running Breezy that was installed from a Beta release and it didn't seem to have the password. Possibly a regression between the betas and release?

I confirm this also, but if the user changes password through KDE change password GUI, it will not appear in this file again. So solution is change password or modify this file, asap. I agree with above poster, this is a critical bug and needs a fix straight away.

We don't need multiple Ubuntu tasks for this bug; the shadow one will do, since that's where the bulk of the bug fix resides, and where at least part of the bug was caused in the first place.

And yes, more confirmation of this bug isn't needed now that I (installer maintainer) have confirmed it myself and uploaded security patches, but thanks all the same. :-)

I had formated my PC and had installed a daily version of Dapper from the begining of March (can't remember the exact date, though). I'd like to say that the information concerning the user created during the installation is still there in the files! So it is not solved in Dapper, unlike Dennis said. Or maybe I'm just weird or anything...

Intresting. My server was dist-upgraded from Hoary (IIRC) and it lacks this entries. Or maybe I've installed it with Expert mode? I'll check other machine. My Breezy-now-update-to-Dapper machine's clean, too.

I have uploaded the source packages, but they are still in the process

of being built. I expect updated binary packages to be available within

the next couple of hours.

To update you on that, amd64, i386, and sparc binaries for dapper will

be available in about fifteen minutes; ia64 in about an hour and fifteen

minutes; and the powerpc build is stuck behind a gcj-4.0 upload, but it

shouldn't take too much longer.

I didn't notice the password being revealed on my own laptop, but all my lab machines were exposed. Confirmed on 22+ machines. Hopefully the patch will fix this. Nice work guys ;-)

I didn't notice the password being revealed on my own laptop, but all my lab machines were exposed. Confirmed on 22+ machines. Hopefully the patch will fix this. Nice work guys ;-)

Just a note that /var/log/debian-installer/ is a symlink to /var/log/installer/ so it there is only the one file to remove (or chmod).

I just upgraded a 5.10 installation for this. I did remove the file once I read about the problem usinf "shred -u", so I can't confirm that it works. However, I saw that the fix was added to /usr/sbin/base-config itself and not to the postinst of base-config. Is base-config really run during an upgrade? Or will this fix only take effect after the next reboot?

Also, the priority in the changelog is "low". Should that not be "critical" (or at least "high")?

Finally: is there any downside if I just remove (or better shred) that file?

No, the base-config fix was only to deal with new installations from

customised CD images built from breezy + breezy-security. The fix for

upgraders is in the passwd package.

Yeah, but I forgot in among everything else I was trying to do. It

doesn't actually make much difference in practice.

(There's no huge virtue in shredding the file, since it only makes a

difference to somebody with physical disk access anyway.)

The only downside is that the log will no longer be available to help

triage installer bugs. If you didn't encounter any other installer bugs,

removing it is safe enough.

How about a new iso with this fix and other updates ? Imo, this fix is serious enough to issue a r1. Ofcourse not through shipit, but atleast for new users who install breezy ?

I've already put that on the agenda for discussion at the next technical board meeting. It'll take until then to come up with a really correct fix that would be suitable for fresh Breezy installer images (as opposed to the security patches which merely undo the damage after it's been caused) anyway.

Hi Guys,

I just need to say that I only do "expert" installs and \*both\* the root password and the user password created at install time \*are\* in the log file.

So all those feeling relieved that they did a "expert" install, shouldn't be :-)

Cheers & well spotted Karl.

So, here's the set of stuff that I've released so far for this bug.

Breezy security updates:

shadow (1:4.0.3-37ubuntu8) breezy-security; urgency=low

\* Tidy up after Malone [bug #34606](/bugs/34606), which left passwords exposed in

    /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat, by removing those passwords;

    for good measure, make /var/log/installer/cdebconf/\* world-unreadable if

    this bug is detected.

-- Colin Watson <email address hidden> Sun, 12 Mar 2006 21:43:40 +0000

base-config (2.67ubuntu20) breezy-security; urgency=low

\* Tidy up after Malone [bug #34606](/bugs/34606), which left passwords exposed in

    /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat, by removing those passwords

    when base-config runs; for good measure, make

    /var/log/installer/cdebconf/\* world-unreadable if this bug is detected.

-- Colin Watson <email address hidden> Sun, 12 Mar 2006 22:28:05 +0000

shadow deals with upgraders, and base-config deals with people doing fresh installs from CD images they've built themselves from breezy + breezy-security (which is more of a corner case, but it won't be obvious to most people why the shadow fix can't cover fresh installs).

Dapper:

shadow (1:4.0.13-7ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

\* Tidy up after Malone [bug #34606](/bugs/34606), which left passwords exposed in

    /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat, by removing those passwords;

    for good measure, make /var/log/installer/cdebconf/\* world-unreadable if

    this bug is detected.

-- Colin Watson <email address hidden> Sun, 12 Mar 2006 22:45:32 +0000

This mirrors the breezy-security change. There's no base-config change because base-config is no longer used in Dapper, and since this bug only manifests in some very strange circumstances in Dapper it's not necessary to do that kind of post-install cleanup there.

cdebconf (0.97ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

\* Backport from trunk:

    - Honour accept\_types/reject\_types for questions registered against

      templates that were received in DATA commands over passthrough. This

      was one of the root causes of Ubuntu's recent installer password

      disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2006-1183).

-- Colin Watson <email address hidden> Mon, 13 Mar 2006 02:08:16 +0000

This fixes one of the two fundamental issues that caused this bug. (The other was in initial-passwd-udeb, which Dapper no longer uses, which is part of the reason it largely doesn't suffer from this.)

cdebconf (0.97ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

\* Backport from trunk:

    - Reset question template pointers whenever they change, not just when

      the tag changes; do this in X\_LOADTEMPLATEFILE and dpkg-reconfigure as

      well as debconf-loadtemplate.

    - Add a remove method to the question database; use this to migrate

      questions to the correct stacked database in the event that their

      types change (fixes preseeded passwords ending up in questions.dat on

      the installed system in some cases).

  \* Add CVE number to 0.97ubuntu2 changelog entry.

This fixes a more subtle issue, namely that preseeded installs of Dapper where the preseed file had incorrect types for the password questions (that is, any type other than "password") would finish up with the preseeded password in /var/log/installer/cdebconf/questions.dat. We need a debian-installer upload for these cdebconf changes to take effect, which I'm going to do shortly.
Finally, changes from Debian to installation-report and prebaseconfig for Dapper are waiting in the wings to make all the installation logs readable by root only.

I'm new to the linux nomenclature so pardon a dumb question.... but wouldn't just locking the logfile to root only access prevent the security problems?

if the default lockout of root could prevent the installer from accessing it there is it possible to tie it to the first user only(the only PW that gets logged is first user so ok for him to see)

I would think there should be some way to limit access to the logfile since it is only there IF something (else) goes wrong

As to the severity, I am not opposed to a low severity since EVERYONE should immediatly change EVERY first pasword on EVERY app, account and anything else you can think of. and this precaution seems to fix the problem. (my prefered first password list includes "changemenow")

Yes, and we've already done that now; although I prefer to go further

and make sure the password isn't there at all. I'm just leaving this bug

open while we clean up all the pieces.

I don't expect that we'll do a point release for Breezy, given that Dapper is out (and with its own first point release on the way). Any reason to keep this open?
