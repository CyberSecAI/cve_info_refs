Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way WordPress handles the request URI (`$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`) when constructing pagination links. It fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data within the URL, specifically angle brackets (`<` and `>`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Because the request URI is included directly into the HTML without sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code through a specially crafted URL. This code will then be executed within the context of the user's browser when they visit the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser. This could include stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting the user to malicious sites, defacing pages or any other malicious activity. In some cases, it was suggested that the attacker could even elevate privileges to administer the blog.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the query string, e.g., `http://www.example.com/blog/?"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`. The vulnerability was particularly exploitable in Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to get the victim to click on the malicious URL. No specific user privileges or server access are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to how Internet Explorer handles URLs. Other browsers like Mozilla convert `<` to `&lt;` in the URL, thus preventing the XSS.
- The fix for this issue involved using the `wp_specialchars()` function to properly sanitize the request URI. This function encodes special characters, including `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"`, preventing the injection of malicious code. The initially proposed patch in the bug report was not used.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2006-1796.
- The vulnerability was present in WordPress versions prior to 2.0.1.
