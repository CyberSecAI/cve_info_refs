  "CVE-2006-1998": {
    "description": "The OpenTTD server is vulnerable to a remote Denial of Service.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The OpenTTD server is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to a flaw in the manner the game server handles errors in command packets. Specifically, the server and client handle error commands (PACKET_SERVER_ERROR and PACKET_CLIENT_ERROR) for displaying pre-built errors. Sending an invalid, large error number causes the program to terminate via the error() function.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper error handling",
          "Lack of input validation"
        ],
         "impact": "An authenticated attacker can cause a Denial of Service by sending an invalid error number to a vulnerable OpenTTD server.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote network attack"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user, which involves having access to the server, not being banned, knowing the password if it's set, and the server must not be full."
      },
       {
        "root_cause": "The client is vulnerable to an issue when handling UDP packets. The first two bytes of the UDP packet indicate packet size. If an invalid size (e.g., too small) is received, the client immediately returns to the main menu. This can be exploited by a malicious server broadcasting invalid replies, preventing clients from joining online games.",
        "weaknesses": [
           "Improper UDP packet size handling",
           "Lack of input validation"
        ],
         "impact": "Clients attempting to connect to an online game may be forced to return to the main menu, effectively being disconnected by a malicious server. This causes denial of service for joining online games.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote network attack via broadcast"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious server, visible in the master server list, is required to send invalid UDP packets"
