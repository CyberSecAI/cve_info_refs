{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `downloadid` parameter of the `download_click.asp` page and the `content_ID` parameter of the `News_Item.asp` page, allowing for SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access (e.g., user passwords), data modification, or complete database compromise. In this specific case, the attacker aims to retrieve user passwords and decrypt them.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET requests with a crafted SQL payload within the `downloadid` or `content_ID` parameters."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and must have some understanding of SQL to construct a malicious query. No prior authentication is needed for the most dangerous attack vectors."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "more_details": "The provided exploit script demonstrates how to extract usernames and encrypted passwords from the `users` table. The script also includes a function to decrypt passwords using the application's own decryption algorithm. Multiple SQL injection points were identified within different modules, including admin panel pages, requiring admin access to exploit those.",
