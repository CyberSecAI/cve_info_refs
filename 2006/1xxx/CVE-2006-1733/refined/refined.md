Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1733:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `www.kb.cert.org`, `bugzilla.mozilla.org` and `www.mozilla.org` directly mentions CVE-2006-1733 and provides detailed information about the vulnerability.
*   The descriptions of the vulnerability across these sources match the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue lies in the insufficient protection of the compilation scope of privileged built-in XBL (XML Binding Language) bindings within Mozilla products.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the `valueOf.call()` and `valueOf.apply()` methods can be used to access this compilation scope.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privileged XBL Binding Exposure:** The vulnerability allows user-controlled content to access privileged XBL bindings.
*   **Code Execution:**  The exposed compilation scope can be exploited to compile and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the XBL binding,
*   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Security checks within the JavaScript engine are not sufficient to prevent access to the XBL compilation scope.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the attacked XBL binding
*   **Malware Installation:** This can lead to the installation of malware, such as viruses and password sniffers.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Web Content Manipulation:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through malicious web content

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious web content to a user of a vulnerable Mozilla product. No special user privileges or positions are required.

**7. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by using a crafted webpage that uses the `valueOf.call()` or `valueOf.apply()` methods on a method of a privileged XBL binding.
*   The vulnerability exists in the way the JavaScript engine handles method calls and property access in conjunction with XBL bindings.
*   The JavaScript function `js_ComputeThis` does not perform access checks, which allows for access to privileged objects.
*   The JavaScript engine does not correctly use the `parent` chain vs. the `prototype` chain when doing access checks.
*   A DOM object wrapper can be used to circumvent security checks for the constructor property.
*   The use of the Function constructor within the XBL scope can be abused to create privileged functions.

**Additional Notes:**

* The bugzilla entry ([Bug 312871](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312871)) provides a detailed discussion about the vulnerability, its root cause, and the fixes implemented
* The provided content includes patches that fix the issue by enforcing correct security checks and preventing access to the compilation scope from untrusted contexts.
* Red Hat mentions that the issue affects Firefox and Thunderbird as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and provides a link to an advisory.
*   The CERT vulnerability note ([VU#488774](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/488774)) also describes the vulnerability and references Mozilla Security Advisory 2006-16, where this CVE is officially addressed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2006-1733 is a critical vulnerability in Mozilla products that stems from insufficient protection of the XBL compilation scope, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and potentially install malware. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, and various fixes were implemented, including adding access checks and addressing the issues with the `valueOf.call()`, `valueOf.apply()`, and `__proto__` chains within the JavaScript engine.
