# ClamAV: Buffer overflow in Freshclam — GLSA **200605-03**

Freshclam is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.88.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.88.2** |

### Background

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner. Freshclam is a utility to download
virus signature updates.

### Description

Ulf Harnhammar and an anonymous German researcher discovered that
Freshclam fails to check the size of the header data returned by a
webserver.

### Impact

By enticing a user to connect to a malicious webserver an attacker
could cause the execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.88.2"
```

## ClamAV vulnerable to buffer overflow via malicious database mirror

#### Vulnerability Note VU#599220

Original Release Date: 2006-06-28 | Last Revised: 2006-06-29

---

### Overview

The Open Source anti-virus program [ClamAV's](http://www.clamav.net/) update engine, freshclam, contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. If exploited, an attacker could create a denial-of-service condition, or possibly run arbitrary code with the privileges of the freshclam process.

### Description

| Freshclam is a command line utility that installs and updates virus signatures that are used by the ClamAV anti-virus software. It uses the HTTP protocol to perform file downloads from various web servers that host virus signature updates.  By directly changing one of the HTTP mirrors, or by using another means of redirecting the freshclam process to an attacker-controlled HTTP server, the attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition by sending an oversized HTTP header to the freshclam process.Note that ClamAV and freshclam server and client programs are available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple OS X, and BSD operating systems. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may create a denial-of-service condition. The vendor reports that remote execution of arbitrary code would not be easy due to diversity of client platforms and architectures. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**See the systems affected section of this document for information about specific vendors. Users who compile ClamAV from source are encouraged to upgrade to [ClamAV version 0.88.2](http://www.clamav.net/stable.php#pagestart). |

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1050-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Martin Schulze
May 2nd, 2006                           <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : clamav
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-1989
BugTraq ID     : 17754

Ulf Härnhammar and an anonymous researcher from Germany discovered a
vulnerability in the protocol code of freshclam, a command line
utility responsible for downloading and installing virus signature
updates for ClamAV, the antivirus scanner for Unix.  This could lead
to a denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.9.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.88.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
