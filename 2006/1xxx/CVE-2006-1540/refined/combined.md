How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Some Excel Information
======================
- Microsoft Excel uses the BIFF (Binary Interchange File Format)
- in Excel 8.0 (Excel 97), BIFF8 was introduced
- in Excel 10.0 (Excel XP), BIFF8X was introduced
- Excel 97 and Excel 2000 can read BIFF8X, except new features added with Excel XP.

Since BIFF5, all data is saved in OLE2 Storage Format/Structured Storage, which
can contain streams and storages.

A BIFF record is builded as follows:

        0          2    Identifier                              }
        2          2    Size of the following data (sz)         } Record header
        4 	  sz 	Data

The XLS File Format
===================
If we open an Excel .xls workbook document with a hexeditor, we can see the
below block of records, which exists multiple times within an Excel document.

(Offsets are hexadecimal)

We found this block of records two times in an empty Excel document. I haven't
found an exact explanation about these records. It could be, that the record
FFFE defines the sheet range. More in the OpenOffice reference link on site 100.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### General Information

## Executive Summary

This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own "Vulnerability Details" section.

When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**I am updating the administrative installation points and I noticed that there are two .mspâs. Why?**

Limitations in our security update detection logic necessitate us having two separate updates. This is because the file being updated, mso.dll, ships in so many products that if we used a single .MSP to target them all, the detection logic in the MSP would be too large for our detection tools to consume. We are actively working on resolving this limitation.

**The administrative installation points lists mso.msp and pvmso.msp. Do I need to install both packages?**

Yes, the mso.msp targets most of the Office products, such as Word and Excel. The pvmso.msp targets additional Office products, such as Visio, Project and OneNote. In order to be secure you will need to install both packages.

**What updates does this release replace?**

This security update replaces a prior security update. The security bulletin IDs and affected software are listed in the following table.

| Bulletin ID | Microsoft Office 2003 | Microsoft Office XP, Project 2002 Service Pack 1, and Visio 2002 Service Pack 2 | Microsoft Office 2000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [MS05-005](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms05-005) | Not Applicable | Replaced | Not Applicable |

**Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA 1.2.1 | MBSA 2.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | No |
| Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac | No | No |
| Microsoft Office v. X for Mac | No | No |

**Note** MBSA 1.2.1 uses an integrated version of the Office Detection Tool (ODT) which does not support remote scans of this security update. For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).

For more information about MBSA, visit the [MBSA Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134). For more information about the programs that Microsoft Update and MBSA 2.0 currently do not detect, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 895660](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/895660).

**Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine whether this update is required?**

The following table provides the SMS summary for this security update.

| Software | SMS 2.0 | SMS 2003 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office 2003 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office XP | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2000 | Yes | Yes |
| Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac | No | No |
| Microsoft Office v. X for Mac | No | No |

SMS uses MBSA for detection. Therefore, SMS has the same limitation that is listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect.

For SMS 2.0, the SMS SUS Feature Pack, which includes the Security Update Inventory Tool, can be used by SMS to detect security updates. SMS SUIT uses the MBSA 1.2.1 engine for detection. For more information about the Security Update Inventory Tool, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/2003/featurepacks/suspack). For more information about the limitations of the Security Update Inventory Tool, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306460](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306460). The SMS SUS Feature Pack also includes the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates, visit the following [Microsoft Web site](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/downloads/tools/msupdates.mspx). SMS 2003 can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect required updates for Microsoft Office applications.

For more information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

## Vulnerability Details

#### Microsoft Office Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office, and could be exploited when a malformed string included in an Office file was parsed by any of the affected Office applications.  Such a string might be included in an email attachment processed by one of the affected applications or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed email message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Office file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* On Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must accept a prompt confirming that they **Open**, **Save** or **Cancel** the attachment that is sent in an e-mail message before the exploit could occur.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**Note** Office 2000 does not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

**Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from un-trusted sources or that you received unexpectedly from trusted sources.**

This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a file.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Office Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1316:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office, and could be exploited when a malformed string included in an Office file was parsed by any of the affected Office applications. Such a string might be included in an email attachment processed by one of the affected applications or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed email message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Office file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Office opens a specially crafted Office file and parses a malformed string, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opened the file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Office parses the length of a record before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Microsoft Office Control Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1318

#### Microsoft Office Malformed String Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1540

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Office, and could be exploited when a malformed string included in an Office file was parsed by any of the affected Office applications.  Such a string might be included in an email attachment processed by one of the affected applications or hosted on a malicious web site.  Viewing or previewing a malformed email message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Office file that could allow remote code execution.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Office Malformed String Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1540

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* On Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must accept a prompt confirming that they **Open**, **Save** or **Cancel** the attachment that is sent in an e-mail message before the exploit could occur.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**Note** Office 2000 does not prompt the user to **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft Office Malformed String Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1540:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.
