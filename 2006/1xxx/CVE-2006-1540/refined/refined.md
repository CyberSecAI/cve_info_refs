  "CVE-2006-1540": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office due to improper parsing of malformed strings in Office files. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "details": [
      {
        "source": "www.exploit-db.com_6d68adc1_20250125_143451.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office parses BIFF (Binary Interchange File Format) records. Specifically, manipulating the size of data in a record can lead to an access violation, allowing for denial of service or potentially code execution.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Array index bounds error",
           "Improper input validation"
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Maliciously crafted .xls, .xlw, .doc, or .ppt file.",
          "Opening the file with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office."
        ],
         "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed Office document, no specific position is required, other than the ability to deliver a document to a user."
      },
      {
        "source": "docs.microsoft.com_889aff96_20250125_143449.html",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when a malformed string within an Office file is parsed by affected Office applications, potentially corrupting system memory.",
         "weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation",
           "Memory corruption"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution, enabling an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Opening a malicious Office file received via email.",
          "Visiting a compromised website hosting a malicious Office file."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file, and then persuade a user to open it. No specific position is required other than the ability to deliver a file to the victim."

        "source": "www.kb.cert.org_ee29626b_20250125_143444.html",
        "root_cause": "Microsoft Office fails to properly parse strings. When an Office document containing a malformed string is opened, system memory can be corrupted in a way that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper string parsing",
