How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Information | |
| Most people know that DOOM was written by [id Software](http://www.idsoftware.com). This project is not supported by them. csDoom (Client/Server Doom) was written by [Sergey A. Makovkin](http://csdoom.sourceforge.net), aka Fly. It was later abandoned, partially due to the immature behaviour of people. There was much potential. The code, however, was buggy. Egos were bloated. Exploits were found and used. IRC channels were taken over. Wish I was there type of stuff.  I discovered csDoom much later than these events happened. Noting the crashy code, immediately I set about patching my own client. Having reported several security problems to NightFang, who was rarely around, I did not get much of a responce or any acknowledgement from him. Reading old logs and post-mortems, I have serious doubts about whether he was one of the good guys, or the bad.  Have never been able to find or contact Fly (update: I have seen and briefly talked to Fly online very recently for a couple of minutes. He is alive and well, and also thinks the bugs should be patched). His site lies deserted, empty. The binaries and sources on that site are old and I have lost count of the problems inherent in his last release. However, the game works. I have now set out to fix and improve the game. However, I do not intend to make any major changes.  csDoom 2005 aims:  1. To patch all critical security flaws 2. To fix lesser cheats and exploits 3. To maintain backward compatibility with 0.7 4. To conserve classic gameplay 5. To improve access to the game 6. To get more people to experience DOOM! 7. To create a node of development communication 8. To gather bug reports 9. To clean-up the game code 10. To provide csDoom continuity 11. To provide csDoom support 12. To add OSX support  Where my loyalties lie:  1. To the game 2. To the code 3. To the authors (id Software, Fly) 4. To all the players 5. To all contributors 6. To the open source community 7. To the public  I am NOT doing this:  1. To compete with [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/) 2. To settle old scores 3. To add new features 4. To damage anything 5. To confuse people 6. To earn street cred 7. To earn money | |

===============
1) Introduction
===============
client/server Doom (csDoom) is an open source Doom engine developed by
Sergey Makovkin and based on the ZDoom 1.22 code.
The game is focused on online multiplayer and the latest version has
been released in the far year 2000.
In the 2004/2005 Denis Lukianov decided to continue the development of
this engine focusing moreover on the removing of all the bugs which
caused the death of this software.
Although enough old, this game is still included in the Internet Doom
Explorer (IDE, http://nfdfn.jinr.dubna.su/~bond/csdoom/) server browser
used to retrieve the online servers list of some multiplayer Doom
engine.

=======
2) Bugs
=======
----------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in SV\_BroadcastPrintf
----------------------------------------
The function SV\_BroadcastPrintf is used by the server for sending a
message to all the connected clients.
For example it's used when a client joins the match or when he sends a
chat message.
The buffer used for containing the generated string is composed by
1024 bytes while the input text sent from the attacker can be max 2048
bytes long (MSG\_ReadString) allowing possible malicious code execution.
From doomsv/src/sv\_main.cpp:
void STACK\_ARGS SV\_BroadcastPrintf (int level, const char \*fmt, ...)
{
va\_list argptr;
char string[1024];
client\_t \*cl;
va\_start (argptr,fmt);
vsprintf (string, fmt,argptr);
va\_end (argptr);
...
--------------------------------------
B] buffer-overflow in SV\_SetupUserInfo
--------------------------------------
When a player joins the server he sends two text strings which identify
his nickname and teamname.
Both these strings (max 2048 bytes, MSG\_ReadString) are copied through
strcpy() in two buffers of 16 bytes.
Anyway these buffers are global, not local, so should be not possible
to use this bug for executing malicious code but only for crashing the
server.
From doomsv/src/sv\_main.cpp:
void SV\_SetupUserInfo(void)
{
player\_t \*p;
p = &players[parse\_cl];
strcpy(p->userinfo.netname, MSG\_ReadString() );
strcpy(p->userinfo.team, MSG\_ReadString() );
...
--------------------------
C] format string in Printf
--------------------------
Both client and server have the same format string vulnerability in the
PrintString function (in the instruction "printf (outline);") located
in doom\*/src/c\_console.cpp.
This function is used for visualizing all the text strings in the
console and in the game screen through the Printf function, widely used
in the engine.
The following code flow should be enough clear:
int STACK\_ARGS Printf (int printlevel, const char \*format, ...)
{
va\_list argptr;
int count;
va\_start (argptr, format);
count = VPrintf (printlevel, format, argptr);
va\_end (argptr);
return count;
}
int VPrintf (int printlevel, const char \*format, va\_list parms)
{
char outline[8192];
if (gameisdead)
return 0;
vsprintf (outline, format, parms);
return PrintString (printlevel, outline);
}
int PrintString (int printlevel, const char \*outline)
{
printf (outline);
return strlen (outline);
}
Note: this bug has been already patched by Denis in the csDoom client.
