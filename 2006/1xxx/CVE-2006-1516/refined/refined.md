  "CVE-2006-1516": {
    "description": "The MySQL database server is vulnerable to an information leakage issue during the authentication handshake process for anonymous users. By sending a malformed login packet without a null byte terminator, an attacker can cause the server to read beyond the packet boundary and return potentially sensitive memory contents in an error message. This vulnerability is present in versions <= 4.0.26, 4.1.18, and 5.0.20.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when parsing login packets for anonymous users. Specifically, the server does not correctly check if a null byte terminator exists at the end of the username field, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the MySQL server's memory, including parts of queries and responses from other users. In some cases, this leaked information could include passwords or other credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network Socket (port 3306)",
      "Unix Socket"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have direct access to the MySQL server's communication layer either via the network port or the Unix socket, and be able to send a crafted login packet. While network access is usually protected, this attack can be coupled with other vulnerabilities like PHP code injection which can allow an attacker to gain access to the communication layer via socket programming."
