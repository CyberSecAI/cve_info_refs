Debian Security Advisory DSA 1034-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
April 14th, 2006                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : horde2
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2006-1260 CVE-2006-1491

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Horde web
application framework, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
web script code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2006-1260

    Null characters in the URL parameter bypass a sanity check, which
    allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files, which allowed
    information disclosure.

CVE-2006-1491

    User input in the help viewer was passed unsanitised to the eval()
    function, which allowed injection of arbitrary web code.

The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain horde2 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.8-1sarge2.

The unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain horde2 packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your horde2 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias sarge

  Architecture independent components:

    <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/h/horde2/horde2_2.2.8-1sarge2_all.deb>
      Size/MD5 checksum:   721398 35fa1bf8bf8b4f2be1076501b984367a

  These files will probably be moved into the stable distribution on
  its next update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

        changes.
      - Improved mysql session handler.
      - Improved support for Internet Explorer 7 and Opera Mini browsers.
      - Fixed quota support for some VFS drivers.
      - Fixed menu wrapping with Kolab and Purple theme.

# Horde Application Framework: Remote code execution â€” GLSA **200604-02**

The help viewer of the Horde Framework allows attackers to execute
arbitrary remote code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/horde** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.1** |

### Background

The Horde Application Framework is a general-purpose web
application framework written in PHP, providing classes for handling
preferences, compression, browser detection, connection tracking, MIME
and more.

### Description

Jan Schneider of the Horde team discovered a vulnerability in the
help viewer of the Horde Application Framework that could allow remote
code execution (CVE-2006-1491). Paul Craig reported that
"services/go.php" fails to validate the passed URL parameter correctly
(CVE-2006-1260).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability in the help viewer to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user. By
embedding a NULL character in the URL parameter, an attacker could
exploit the input validation issue in go.php to read arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All Horde Application Framework users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/horde-3.1.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : horde3
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2005-4190 CVE-2006-1260 CVE-2006-1491
Debian Bug     : 361967

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Horde web
application framework, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
web script code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-4190

    Several Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
    the "share edit window".

CVE-2006-1260

    Null characters in the URL parameter bypass a sanity check, which
    allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files, which allowed
    information disclosure.

CVE-2006-1491

    User input in the help viewer was passed unsanitised to the eval()
    function, which allowed injection of arbitrary web code.

The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain horde3 packages.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.4-4sarge3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
