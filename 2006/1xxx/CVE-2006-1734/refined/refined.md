      "description": "\"shutdown\" discovered that it is possible to access an internal function object which could then be used to run arbitrary JavaScriptcode with full permissions of the user running the browser, which could be used to install spyware or viruses. [MFSA-2006-15]",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the ability to use the Object.watch() method to access an internal function object (the \"clone parent\") of a JavaScript function.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper access control to internal function object.",
         "Ability to run arbitrary JavaScript with full user permissions."

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable browser. This could be achieved by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or opening a crafted email if Javascript is enabled in email."
