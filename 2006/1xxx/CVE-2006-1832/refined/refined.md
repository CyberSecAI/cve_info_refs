{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1832",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sysinfo.cgi` script allows remote command execution through the `name` parameter in the `systemdoc` action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized input to the `name` parameter allows for command injection."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to `sysinfo.cgi` with a crafted `action` and `name` parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `sysinfo.cgi` script."
  },
  "exploit": {
    "description": "The provided exploit code first retrieves the document root path by accessing the `debugger` action. Then, it creates a PHP shell in the document root using the command injection vulnerability in the `systemdoc` action. Finally, it executes arbitrary commands by accessing the created PHP shell.",
    "steps": [
      "Retrieve document root using `action=debugger`.",
      "Inject a PHP shell using `action=systemdoc` and a command to create a PHP file.",
       "Execute arbitrary commands through the created PHP shell using `?cmd=<command>`."
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": "The exploit utilizes a PHP script to send HTTP requests, retrieve the document root, inject a PHP shell, and execute commands. The exploit also provides proxy and port options. The vulnerability is located in the `sysinfo.cgi` script."
