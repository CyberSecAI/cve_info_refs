Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-1613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `visview.php` script. Specifically, the parameters `yname`, `emailadd`, `subject`, and `comment` are vulnerable.
*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries. Vulnerable scripts include `login.php`, `fpass.php`, and `visview.php`. The vulnerable variables are `$user123` in `login.php`, `$user123` in `fpass.php`, and `$_GET['cid']` in `visview.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Multiple XSS:** The `visview.php` script allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML or web script code through several parameters.
*   **Multiple SQL Injections:** The scripts `login.php`, `fpass.php`, and `visview.php` are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-controlled inputs before they're used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
*  **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive database information, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Sending a crafted GET request to `visview.php` with malicious code injected into the vulnerable parameters.
*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted GET request to vulnerable scripts with malicious SQL code injected into the vulnerable parameters and using the union select method to obtain the needed information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application
* The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered in 2006.
* The vendor was notified but the software remains unpatched
* The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off for SQL injection attacks to work
* The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of aWebNews.
