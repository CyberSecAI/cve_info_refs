How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: runit: setting of multiple groups using -u is broken
Date: Thu, 09 Mar 2006 10:00:27 +0100
```
Package: runit
Version: 1.3.3-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

Hi Gerrit,

As I told you during lunch a few weeks ago, the chpst binary in the
Sid package of runit behaves buggy regarding multiple groups in the
-u parameter:

$ strace -s 4096 -f /usr/bin/chpst -u nobody:ipod:nogroup:camera:mythtv/bin/sleep 1 2>&1 | grep setgroups

setgroups(4, [1006, 0, 65534, 0])       = 0

The 0 groups are wrong here, so the process gets permissions for the
root group where is shouldn't!

The correct group IDs look like this:

$ grep -E "ipod|nogroup|camera|mythtv" /etc/group
nogroup:x:65534:
mythtv:x:110:scorpion
ipod:x:1006:scorpion
camera:x:1009:scorpion

A chpst binary built using just "make" on my unstable system (which will be
linked against glibc) behaves correctly:

$ strace -s 4096 -f src/runit-1.3.3/admin/runit-1.3.3/src/chpst -u nobody:ipod:nogroup:camera:mythtv /bin/sleep 1 2>&1 | grep setgroups

setgroups32(4, [1006, 65534, 1009, 110]) = 0

I think the reason is that dietlibc handles the gid_t type as 16 bit on
i386. In /usr/include/diet/sys/types.h, I found this:

#elif defined(__arm__) || defined(__i386__) || defined(__sparc__) || defined(__s390__) /* make sure __s390x__ hits before __s390__ */
    typedef uint16_t dev_t;
    typedef uint16_t gid_t;

Whereas glibc uses 32 bit for gid_t on i386.

In chpst, a struct uidgid will be used to build the list for setgroups,
and it uses int for the groups:

struct uidgid {
  int uid;
  int gid[61];
  int gids;
};

Therefore, on the little endian i386 architecture with dietlibc, the
list of 32 bit values supplied by chpst will be threated as a list of
16 bit values in setgroups(), resulting in a 0 on each second list entry.

I suggest to use gid_t in the struct uidgid to fix this.

Regards,
Tino
