Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the WeOnlyDo! SFTP ActiveX control (wodSFTP) being incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting." This designation, made via the IObjectSafety interface, implies that the control won't perform any actions that could harm a user's system or compromise their security, regardless of how its methods and properties are manipulated through scripting. However, the wodSFTP control's methods for file upload and download do not adhere to this assertion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure ActiveX Control:** The wodSFTP ActiveX control is marked as "safe for scripting" despite having methods that can download arbitrary files to the local system and upload arbitrary files from the local system. These methods can be executed without user interaction.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The ActiveX control doesn't properly restrict access to its methods, allowing arbitrary file transfers.
- **Incorrect Safety Declaration:** The control's IObjectSafety interface incorrectly declares the control as safe for scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can force the download of arbitrary files onto a vulnerable system, potentially including malicious executables. The downloaded files reside within the security context of the user running Internet Explorer.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files from the victim's machine to a remote SFTP server.
- **Code Execution:** By downloading malicious files to sensitive locations (e.g., Windows Startup folder), an attacker can achieve code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from a victim's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:** A malicious web page can use scripting to manipulate the wodSFTP control and initiate unauthorized file transfers.
- **HTML Emails/Attachments:** The same method can be used through specially crafted HTML emails or attachments that are viewed in Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not require any authentication or access to the vulnerable system, only the ability to convince a victim to view malicious HTML content.
- **Scripting Knowledge:** The attacker needs scripting knowledge to manipulate the ActiveX control's methods.

**Additional details:**
- The vendor, WeOnlyDo! Software, was notified of the issue on May 25, 2006 and updated May 31, 2006 but has no plans to fix the vulnerability.
- The vendor also stated that removing the 'safe for scripting' flag will render the ActiveX control unusable.
- The vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of CERT/CC.
- The CLSID for the vulnerable control is {6795FA0F-35C3-4BEB-B3AA-F19DB0B228EA}.
- The recommended workarounds are either to disable the control via a kill bit, or disable Active scripting and ActiveX in the Internet Zone.
