Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-1132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the vbzoom v1.11 software, specifically in handling user-supplied parameters within the `show.php`, `comment.php`, `profile.php`, and `contact.php` scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `show.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `UserID`, `MainID`, and `SubjectID` parameters.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `comment.php`, `profile.php`, and `contact.php` scripts are vulnerable to XSS via the `UserID` and `UserName` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries to:
    - Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain administrative control of the application.
- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface websites.
    - Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `UserID`, `MainID`, and `SubjectID` parameters in the `show.php` script within the URL.
- **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `UserID` parameter in `comment.php`, the `UserName` parameter in `profile.php`, and the `UserID` parameter in `contact.php` scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and craft malicious URLs with specific parameters, no special access or authorization within the application is mentioned as a requirement.

**Summary of vulnerabilities described in the provided document:**

- SQL injection in `show.php` via `UserID`, `MainID` and `SubjectID` parameters
- XSS in `comment.php`, `profile.php` and `contact.php` via `UserID` and `UserName` parameters.
