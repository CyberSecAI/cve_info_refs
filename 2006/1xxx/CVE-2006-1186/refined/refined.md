## CVE-2006-1186

The content relates to CVE-2006-1186.

**Vulnerability Description:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the malicious Web site.

**Root Cause:** Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX Controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the website.
*   The malicious content can also be displayed using banner advertisements or other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
*   E-mail messages could be used if a user clicks on a link that would take them to a malicious Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Customers who have installed the security update included with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-052 or a later security bulletin for Internet Explorer are not at risk from attacks originating from the Internet zone.
*   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
*   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
*   The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX Controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
*   By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability.

**Affected Software:**

*   Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
*   Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2
*   Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition
*   Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1
*   Microsoft Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems and Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 for Itanium-based Systems
*   Microsoft Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition family
*   Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (ME)

**Vulnerable Component:** COM object instantiation in Internet Explorer.

**Weakness:** Improper instantiation of COM objects.

**Remediation:** Apply the update detailed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-013 to prevent these CLSIDs from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. This update sets the kill bit for a list of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) for COM objects that have been found to exhibit similar behavior to the COM object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability.
