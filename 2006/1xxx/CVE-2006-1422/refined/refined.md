```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `event_id` parameter of the `details_view.php` script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the `booking_user` table.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a SQL injection payload in the `event_id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
