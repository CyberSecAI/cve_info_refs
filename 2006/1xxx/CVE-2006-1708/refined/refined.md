  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data (including user passwords), or modify database content.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability exists in the `member.php` file at line 180.",
        "Specifically, the `$showid` variable, which is used in the SQL query `SELECT * FROM member WHERE id=$showid`, is not sanitized.",
        "The attacker can manipulate the GET parameter `showid` to inject malicious SQL code via a URL."

      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with the vulnerable parameter.",
		"No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."

	  "additional_info": "The exploit provided includes a specific SQL injection payload: `-666 union select 0,nick,realname,nick,pass,pass,pass,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 from TABLE_PREFIXmember where id = USER_ID limit 1 /*`. The passwords in the database are base64 encoded, which can easily be decoded to get plain text passwords."
