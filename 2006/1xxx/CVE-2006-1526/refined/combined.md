Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A buffer overflow has been found in the Perl interpreter with the sprintf function which
  may be exploitable under certain conditions.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/001_perl.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: January 5, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Do not allow users to trick suid programs into re-opening files via /dev/fd.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/002_fd.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
        *i386 architecture*

      Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
      Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
      lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
      [mprotect(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2)
      and
      [mmap(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2)
      requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
      instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/003_i386pmap.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006**
          *i386 architecture*

        Constrain
        [i386\_set\_ioperm(2)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/i386/i386_set_ioperm.2)
        so even root is blocked from accessing the ioports
        unless the machine is running at lower securelevels or with an open X11 aperture.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/i386/004_i386machdep.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
          [system(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3)
          function in
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1)
          when performing copy operations using filenames that are supplied by the user from the command line.
          This can be exploited to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running
          [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/005_ssh.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
            asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
            privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/006_sendmail.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
              [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
              Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
              malicious code within the X server.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/007_xorg.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
                message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
                This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
                delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
                delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
                malformed MIME message exists.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/008_sendmail2.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8)'s
                  mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
                  The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
                  with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
                  could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
                  buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/009_httpd.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
                    with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
                    sendmail to crash.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/010_sendmail3.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to an off-by-one error in
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8),
                      it is possible to cause
                      [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8)
                      to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
                      [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/011_dhcpd.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
                        semaphores have been allocated.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/012_sem.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          A problem in
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                          [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8)
                          was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                          An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                          replay counter.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.8/common/013_isakmpd.patch)

                          * **014: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                              *All architectures*

                            Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                            it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                            [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/sppp.4)
                            connection causing the kernel to panic.
                            [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                            * **015: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                                *All architectures*

                              Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                              An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                              to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                              get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                              the functionality of the DNS service.
                              An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                              DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.

                                Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                                an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                                valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

                                    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                                    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                                    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                                    public keys being used.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 09:19:22 UTC  ``` Bart Massey, a X.Org user reported that "When running rendertest from XCB xcb/xcb-demo, the Xorg X server crashes partway through.  100% reproducible on a wide variety of graphics architectures".  Analyzing the bug Eric Anholt found out that a typo in render/mitri.c causes the X render extension to mis-calculate the size of a buffer, leading to an overflow, which can problably be exploited by  clients of the X server on most systems.  This is Freedesktop.org bugzilla #6642. It has been marked confidential,    after the security implications of the problem were identified.  X.Org releases 6.8.0 and later are affected by this bug. Previous  versions (and XFree86 versions) are not affected. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 09:23:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 85279](attachment.cgi?id=85279 "xrender-mitri.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=85279&action=edit "xrender-mitri.diff"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=85279&action=diff "xrender-mitri.diff")] xrender-mitri.diff  Upstream patch. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 09:26:07 UTC  ``` Donnie please advise on severity and attach an updated ebuild to this bug. We will call Arch Security Liaisons to test. Do NOT commit anything yet. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 12:47:11 UTC  ``` For severity, you can just read the description. Buffer overflow, probably exploitable by X clients (any X-using program).  I'll be pushing out a new 6.8.2-r7, 6.9-r1 and xorg-server 1.0.2 and 1.0.99.901-r2. Ah, the joys of so many parallel ebuilds.  Testers will probably want to test either 6.8.2 or 1.0.2, current stable and ~arch. Ebuilds coming today or tomorrow. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 13:07:35 UTC  ``` Thx Donnie, just remember don't commit the updates to Portage just yet:-) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 13:37:28 UTC  ``` You didn't need to tell me the first time, let alone a second. I don't really appreciate being treated like I'm clueless. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-04-23 21:52:32 UTC  ``` To be on the safe side I'd rather say it too often. This was obviously too often. I was just not sure after reading your [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=130979#c3), OTOH you've handled stuff like this before and I should have remembered.

### Overview

A vulnerability in the X.Org X server could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server.

### Description

| The X Window System provides a number of components to support graphical user interfaces, primarily on Unix-like operating systems. It features a client-server design whereby client applications specify instructions to a server (the X server) which then interacts with the display hardware to render graphics on the display. The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as the foundation of a rendering model within the X Window System. The X.Org Foundation provides a free and open source implementation of the X Window System, including the X render extension.  A flaw in the render extension, reportedly introduced through a typographical error, causes an incorrect computation for memory allocation size in XRenderCompositeTriStrip() and XRenderCompositeTriFan() requests. As a result, a buffer may be allocated that is too small to store the parameters of the request. For platforms where the ALLOCATE\_LOCAL() macro is using alloca(), this situation can cause a stack overflow; on other platforms, it can cause a heap overflow. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A client of the X server using the X render extension is able to send requests that will cause a buffer overflow in the server side of the extension. This overflow can be exploited by an authorized client to execute malicious code inside the X server, which is generally running with root privileges. |

X.Org security advisory, May 2nd 2006
Buffer overflow in the Xrender extension of the X.Org server
CVE-ID: CVE-2006-1526

Overview:

A client of the X server using the X render extension is able to
send requests that will cause a buffer overflow in the server side of
the extension.
This overflow can be exploited by an authorized client to execute
malicious code inside the X server, which is generally running with
root privileges.

Vulnerability details:

An unfortunate typo ('&' instead of '\*' in an expression) causes the
code to mis-compute the size of memory allocations in the
XRenderCompositeTriStrip and XRenderCompositeTriFan requests.  Thus a
buffer that may be too small is used to store the parameters of the
request. On platforms where the ALLOCATE\_LOCAL() macro is using
alloca(), this is a stack overflow, on other platforms this is a heap
overflow.

Affected versions:

X.Org 6.8.0 and later versions are vulnerable, as well as all individual
releases of the modular xorg-xserver package.

To check which version you have, run Xorg -version:
% Xorg -version
X Window System Version 7.0.0
Release Date: 21 December 2005
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 7.0

Fix:

Apply the patch below to the source tree for the modular xorg-server
source package:

9a9356f86fe2c10985f1008d459fb272           xorg-server-1.0.x-mitri.diff
d6eba2bddac69f12f21785ea94397b206727ba93   xorg-server-1.0.x-mitri.diff
<http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/X11R7.0/patches/>

For X.Org 6.8.x or 6.9.0, apply one of the patches below:

d666925bfe3d76156c399091578579ae           x11r6.9.0-mitri.diff

This would require anyone who would like to pick the latest
version of a package to look both in the latest release dir
and in individual/ and compate the dates.
I would argue that packages that individually released packages
should ge guaranteed build on a distributed base line - as an
update to a released package.
This may not always be true if combined with a random older release.

I would argue that releases should be stable. Thus making the dirs
read only seems to be appropriate. Some consumers are very allergic
to changes in the checksum of a released version as this may be a
sign of a security compromise.

The other question is what we do about security fixes?
The user who picks the latest release (or any earlier one)
whould have to check for the availability of security fixes
and apply them before building.
Uneducated users may not do this and pick stuff that's insecure
(and has a published vulnerability). With the modular tree it
shouldn't be necessary to create a security release when something
surfaces.
Would it be reasonable to create a separate directory with symlinks
to the version of a package included in a release or a security fixed
version based on the respective release - as a convenience service
for users?

Cheers,
	Egbert.

# X.Org: Buffer overflow in XRender extension — GLSA **200605-02**

A buffer overflow in the XRender extension potentially allows any X.Org
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-base/xorg-x11** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.8.2-r7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.8.2-r7** |

### Background

X.Org is X.Org Foundation's public implementation of the X Window
System.

### Description

X.Org miscalculates the size of a buffer in the XRender extension.

### Impact

An X.Org user could exploit this issue to make the X server
execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X.Org users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.2-r7"
```
