    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-1296",
      "source": "bugs.debian.org_c0c7d01a_20250125_014811.html",
      "root_cause": "The `beagle-status` shell script in Beagle versions 0.2.2.1-1 and earlier insecurely checks for the existence of `./beagle-info` before executing it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The script checks for an executable named `beagle-info` in the current directory (`./beagle-info`).",
        "If found, the script will execute it, leading to a potential arbitrary code execution if a malicious user places a file named `beagle-info` in the directory where `beagle-status` is run from."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. A malicious user could create a malicious `beagle-info` executable in a directory, and when a legitimate user executes `beagle-status` from that directory, the malicious code will be executed with the user's privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local execution of the vulnerable `beagle-status` script.",
        "Placing a malicious executable named `beagle-info` in a directory where `beagle-status` is executed."
      ],
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to write files into a directory where a user will later execute `beagle-status`. This is often a user's home directory or some shared directory."
