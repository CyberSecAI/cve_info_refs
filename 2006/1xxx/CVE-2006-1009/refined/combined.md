## M4 Project Blog:

### December 28th 2008

Slawomir Rzeznicki has written a BOINC wrapper for the project, which has been running
successfully for quite some time now. This means that you can also participate by using
an existing BOINC client or by installing one.

<http://www.enigmaathome.net/>

The standard clients are going to be supported as usual, so nothing changes for
current installs.

### May 28th 2008

I am pleased to announce that the **Scharnhorst
message was broken in less that 24 hours**.
You can read the
[raw server logs](third-break-logs.txt)
as well as an
[interpretation and translation](m4-project-scharnhorst-break.html).

We are now dealing with first message again. This time we try
our luck with the middle part.

### May 27th 2008

We are taking a short break from the last unbroken M4 message in order
to focus on another unbroken message that has been released recently:

<http://cryptocellar.org/bgac/Scharnhorst.html>

This message was probably enciphered with the M3 model.

### August 20th 2007

As you may recall, we have been attacking the first and second parts of the
unbroken message separately. The main server dealt with the second part, the old
server with the first part. Since the old server had just been left in place to
accommodate machines running the old software, the first part has gotten considerably
less attention than the second part. The approximate numbers are 10 passes for
each work unit vs. 60 passes for each work unit.

In order to fix this imbalance, the roles are now reversed. The work unit
overview on the [M4 Project](m4_project.html) page shows the statistics
for the main server dealing with the *first part of the message*.

#### Amount of work done on the second part:

| | Date | Daily | Completed | Remaining | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 2007-08-20 | 1698 | 670730 | 5023270 |   This run was started on March 28th 2006. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Terminology:

The terminology has been an ongoing source of confusion. I hope that this analogy
helps to clarify things:

Suppose that you have lost a gold coin in an area of one square kilometer. Fortunately,
you have a metal detector. Unfortunately, the detector is such that you only have a 50%
chance of getting an alert even if you hold it right above the coin.

You come up with a plan. Since you are a methodical person, you divide
the square kilometer into 1000000 work units of one square meter each. Subsequently,
you go over the whole area, processing each unit once. In 50% of the cases,
you'll have found the coin. If you haven't, you'll go over the area a second time, unit
by unit. Now your odds of having found the coin are 75%. And so on.

It should be clear by now that the *square kilometer* stands for the whole *search
space*, which is divided up into *11388 work units*. In the above statistic, we have
searched each work unit about 60 times.

It should also be clear that the large number of *remaining work units* results
from the fact that a *maximum of 500 passes* has been planned per work unit and the
server reports the total number of units as *11388 \* 500 = 5694000*.

### November 15th 2006

#### Enigma Monitor GUI

Willem Alexander Hajenius has written a graphical statistics tool which
shows lots of information about the current work unit. Source code (GPL) as
well as a Windows executable is available here:

<http://hajenius.ifastnet.com/software/EnigmaMonitor/EnigmaMonitor.htm>

If you want to compile yourself, you need a working
[wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org/) installation.

### October 16th 2006

On the unbroken message, all C-Thin/Gamma combinations have been tested at
least once. Since it is unlikely that UKW C-Thin and Greek wheel Gamma were
present on the submarines in November 1942, a single test of those combinations
will have to suffice.

Today we resume the run on the second half of the split message that
had started on March 28th and was interrupted by the C-Thin/Gamma run
on June 22nd.

### July 14th 2006

New versions of the client with the capability to connect to port 443 have been
released. This should make it easier to run the client if you are behind a firewall
and you cannot connect to port 65521. The new versions also introduce an installer.

For users who are already using **version 0.75**
there is **no need to use the new versions**.

### June 22nd 2006

#### Check UKW C-Thin/Gamma combinations

Historians agree that UKW C-Thin and Greek wheel Gamma came into service
in July 1943. However, there is a *slight* possibility that the wheels
were already present on some submarines in November 1942 and had been used by
accident. In order to check whether this is the case, the (new) server now
hands out work units that include C-Thin/Gamma combinations.

The run is done on the full ciphertext. This means that it will take
more time to process a work unit.

#### Status update

Since March 28th the project has been running two servers, each of
them working on one half of the unbroken message. For the first half,
each work unit has been revisited at least 7 times, for the second half
the number is 16. As you may recall, applying the hill climbing algorithm
several times with different random settings increases the chance of
breaking a message.

### May 4th 2006

#### Windows 2000: enigma-client's password expires

It has been reported that the password expiry problem also exists in
Windows 2000. Here's how to fix it:

[Win 2000: change password expiry](howto/m4-project/change-passwd-expiry-2000.html)

### April 21st 2006

#### Windows XP Pro: enigma-client's password expires

In Windows XP Pro, passwords expire by default in 42 days. This means
that the task scheduler will fail to start the client once the password has
expired. You can disable this behaviour:

[Win XP Pro: change password expiry](howto/m4-project/change-passwd-expiry.html)

If the password does not expire, it is all the more important to choose
a strong random password. If you haven't done so already, visit:

[change password and background task](howto/m4-project/changepasswd-bgtask.html)

### April 18th 2006

Some words about the state of affairs: A large number of people haven't upgraded
the software yet. As a consequence we'll have two servers running for the foreseeable
future. As everyone is probably aware, each server hands out one half of the unbroken
message. On average, messages of this length need more restarts (equivalent to "walks
through the search space") than long messages.

The old server splits the complete M4 search space into 75426 work units,
the new server into 11388. Right now we have gone through the search space
for 4.0 times on the old server and 4.7 times on the new server.

Since an element of chance is involved in the random restart hill climbing
algorithm, it is impossible to say exactly how many restarts are needed until
a break is achieved. However, statistical tests on the messages that have already
been broken may be an indication on what to expect. More details are here:

[Hill climbing performance](hillclimbing-performance.html)

### March 28th 2006

#### New versions of the software available. Please upgrade.

New versions of the client software have been released. Please upgrade
as soon as possible. The new versions have the ability to download new
dictionaries automatically and have better logging enabled by default.
The new versions connect to a second server using
**port 65521**. The old server will still accommodate
the clients that haven't upgraded. As a consequence there will be separate
results/stats for the new server:

[New Server Results](new-server-results.txt)

[New Server Stats](new-server-stats.txt)

Here's how to switch versions:

[Unix Client Upgrade](howto/m4-project/unix-client-upgrade.html)

[Windows Client Upgrade](howto/m4-project/windows-client-upgrade.html)

A note about work unit sizes: Due to changes in the software and the way
the new work unit list is generated, the new work units
**come in several different sizes**. Don't
be alarmed if one work unit takes longer to process than another one.

### March 28th 2006

There is a very real possibility that the first message did not break
because there are missing letters somewhere in the signal. To deal with
that, the signal will be split in two parts that are attacked separately.

The new server is now handing out the second half of the message.
The old server will be handing out the first part of the message, so
that the old clients' resources are not wasted. Still I would like
everyone to upgrade, as the new versions are more efficient.

### March 7th 2006

Today **the second break has occurred**.
The signal in question is the *third* of the intercepts in Erskine's
letter. You can read the
[raw server logs](second-break-logs.txt)
as well as an
[interpretation and translation](m4-project-second-break.html).

We are now dealing with first message again.

### March 3rd 2006

We are now going for the third message. The first message has not yielded.

Amount of work spent on the first message:

1. Army model: all rings, 5 walks through the search space.
2. M3: all rings, 5 walks through the search space.
3. M4: middle ring at A, 10 walks through the search space.

This does not mean that this particular message can't be broken with
this method. Some messages require many more walks through the search
space before a break occurs. Also, we did not try all ring settings for
M4 yet.

### March 1st 2006

Kirk Pearson has created the
[M4 Project Wiki, FAQ](http://www.distributedcomputing.info/wiki/index.php/M4).
You can use it for reference or add experiences that might interest others.

For support questions that are not in the FAQ, please consider using the
[M4 Project Mailing List](mailinglists.html).

### February 28th 2006

After the Slashdot article participation levels have risen dramatically.
In the last 12h about 2500 unique IPs have connected to the server. In the
last two hours 2310 work units have been submitted.

There are now two external stats pages, both of which use the primary stats source
[M4 Project Statistics](m4-project-stats.txt):

* Stuart Whelan has set up
  <http://www.somepointinthefuture.com/m4_stats.html>.
* Alexander Haneng came up with
  <http://www.hanengcharts.com/enigma/>.

We have walked through the M4 search space 5.5 times now, no break yet.

I'll soon switch to check if the message was encrypted with M3/Army model
compatible settings after all. For more information on how the server subdivides
the complete M4 search space have a look at the entry on January 9th.

### February 28th 2006

#### Security update: Windows default client install

The Windows XP\* default install instructions create user "enigma-client"
with password "nominal", unless you've changed the script.

Obviously this is not good practice. The latest install instructions
tell the user to replace "nominal" with a strong random password.

If you are already running the client, you do not have to reinstall.
Just follow the
[change password and background task](howto/m4-project/changepasswd-bgtask.html)
instructions.

Reported by Jamyn.

### February 26th 2006

The work unit rate is now around 2650 per day! We are now through about
75% of the M4 search space (single walk).

### February 23rd 2006

The work unit rate is at a new record of 530 per day! The statistics
will take some time to reflect that (see comments on February 19th).
We are now through 15% of the M4 search space (single walk).

### February 21th 2006

I've tried to break the other two messages under the assumption that
they were enciphered with the same day key, so far without success. It
looks like a full run on the other messages is required, so we are now
attacking the first of the three messages. To avoid ambiguity, the message
broken is the *second* of the three.

### February 20th 2006

The first message **has been broken**. You can
see the raw server logs [here](m4-project-first-break.html).

Thanks a lot for participating! I'd say we continue with one of the other messages
in case they weren't enciphered with the same day key. More to follow later.

### February 19th 2006

It appears that over the weekend the work unit rate increased
to about 200 per day. This will take some time to be reflected
in the stats, since the daily rate is calculated over the whole
running time. If we keep this rate, a *single* walk through the
search space could be completed in 30 days.

Note that the test messages referred to on the main page needed
*between one and six walks* through the search space to be
broken. There is always a little luck involved with hill climbing
algorithms.

### February 19th 2006

I released a new Windows version. It fixes a priority issue (reported
by Jeff Gilchrist) and a return value bug in enigma-client.py.

Both fixes are not critical for the correct functioning of
the software, so if you are happy the way it runs you don't
have to reinstall.

However, the new versions now run at *real* idle priority,
and the return value bug is plain ugly.

There is a side effect of running at base priority 1:

If you have other demanding programs running and you start
the client manually (see INSTALL.txt), the client is pretty
unresponsive, so you have to be patient when pressing Ctrl-C
and such.

I have now included an enigma.exe in the source version.
This means that people who have Python AND Mark Hammond's
win32all package on their machine can now download the
much smaller source package and follow the INSTALL.txt
without compiling enigma.exe.

I don't know if the web pages make it clear, but the large sizes
of the binary versions result from the fact that a lot of python
libraries have to be distributed with enigma-client.exe, which is
created by py2exe.

### February 19th 2006

There was a network outage (over half an hour) at my provider.
The server was running, but could not be reached.

### February 3rd 2006

We've walked through the second search space (M3 without Service, see below)
for 3 times. As of today, keys from the third search space are tested. These
keys can only be used with the M4 model.

### February 1st 2006

Just a short status update: Results are now submitted from 10 IPs. In case you
are wondering if things work as they should, from this end all looks fine. Clients
are submitting in plausible intervals and the results are processed as expected.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to write to my address at the bottom
of the page.

### January 29th 2006

After mentioning the project on the
[lfs-chat mailing list](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mail.html),
results are submitted regularly from 4 new IPs (thanks, guys!). Now it kind
of becomes a real distributed project.

### January 25th 2006

Detailed install instructions are available online.

### January 20th 2006

New Unix and Windows versions contain several bugfixes. Most of them
deal with saving the results in a robust way.

### January 9th 2006

**The project has started!** The server now
hands out the *second* of the three messages. Since the Enigma M4 model
is backward compatible with the M3 and the Service models, the server divides up the
M4 search space into three parts:

1. Service Model search space
2. M3 (minus Service) search space
3. M4 (minus M3, minus Service) search space

First we walk through the second search space.

### January 7th 2006

The software package now includes 00trigr.naval and 00bigr.naval.
To create the statistics, I used 15K of original U-Boat signals.
Unfortunately the signals had been cleaned up, so I attempted to recreate
the raw form by applying the rules described in
[The Bletchley Park translated Enigma Instruction Manual](http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/egenproc.pdf).
I can assure you that this is boring work! Here comes an example:

```

Cleaned up version:

Mittags Qu. 85862 durch Feuerüberfall Nachschubkutter
etwa 50 t schwer beschädigt. Leichte Wabos.

```

```

My attempt at a raw version:

mittags qu x act funf act secs zwo durc feueruberfall nacscubkutter
etwa funf nul tonnen scwer bescadigt x leicte wabos

```

Especially the use of *C* instead of *CH*
makes the text look slightly ridiculous. I wonder if that rule was always
observed.

### December 20th 2005

Some words about the the break of challenge message 5:

At the time the server only printed new high scores to the logs. This had
worked well for the other challenge messages. Break 5 though would have been
lost due to the higher score that had been submitted on Dec 5th.

Luckily I restarted the server on Dec. 15th, which wiped out the
reference high score that the server keeps in memory.

After this experience I decided to print every score that is at least
80% of the current high score. This makes the logs less pleasant to read,
but future partial breaks should be safe.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
