**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-1335

**Vulnerability Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the gnome-screensaver application. When the X server is configured with `AllowDeactivateGrabs` and `AllowClosedownGrabs` options, the lock screen can be bypassed.

*   **Root Cause:** The gnome-screensaver application doesn't properly handle the `AllowDeactivateGrabs` and `AllowClosedownGrabs` X server options.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Bypass of Lock Screen:** Using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus`, the lock dialog can lose focus permanently, preventing the user from entering the password and unlocking the screen.
    *   **Killing the Screensaver:** Using `Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply`, the screensaver process is killed, revealing the desktop without requiring a password.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can bypass the screen lock and gain access to an unattended, locked system.
    *   An attacker can kill the screensaver process to access the desktop.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the machine.
    *   **Keyboard Input:** The attack is triggered using specific keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus` or `Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be physically present at the computer with a keyboard.
    *   The X server must be running with `AllowDeactivateGrabs` and/or `AllowClosedownGrabs` option set.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that xscreensaver is not affected by these key combinations, suggesting a different implementation or handling of these events.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in CVS, indicating a fix was implemented.
