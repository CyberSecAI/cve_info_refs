      "cve": "CVE-2006-1596",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `scormExport.inc.php` file where the `includePath` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for remote file inclusion.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
           "Improper Input Validation"
        ],
         "impact": "Remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable Claroline application.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `scormExport.inc.php` script, supplying the malicious code via a `includePath` parameter pointing to a remote server hosting the attacker's PHP code. The `cmd` parameter allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a remote server hosting a PHP file containing the code to be executed on the target server. Also, the target server needs to have `register_globals = On` and `allow_url_fopen = On` or  `register_globals = On` & `magic_quotes_gpc = Off` for a null byte injection attack."
