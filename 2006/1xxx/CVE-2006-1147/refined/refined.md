      "details": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Alien Arena 2006 Gold Edition versions <= 5.00:\n\n**A] safe_cprintf server format string:**\n*   **Root cause:** The `safe_cprintf` function used by the server to send messages to clients uses a format string vulnerability.\n*   **Vulnerability:** The function passes the output string as a format argument to `gi.cprintf()`, similar to a double sprintf, allowing for format string exploits.\n*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.\n*   **Attack vector:** Exploitable in-game by sending crafted messages to the server.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** Attacker must be an in-game client and know the server password if required.\n\n**B] Cmd_Say_f server buffer-overflow:**\n*   **Root cause:** The `Cmd_Say_f` function handles text messages from clients using a fixed-size buffer and `strcat()` without proper bounds checking.\n*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in the text buffer when appending the received message via `strcat()` after the nickname has been added by `Com_sprintf()`\n*    **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.\n*   **Attack vector:** Exploitable in-game by sending a long text message to the server.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** Attacker must be an in-game client and know the server password if required.\n\n**C] Com_sprintf crash:**\n*   **Root cause:** The `Com_sprintf()` function lacks null termination after `strncpy()`, leading to potential crashes.\n*  **Vulnerability:**  `strncpy` is used to copy the formatted string to the destination buffer, however, it does not guarantee null termination, which leads to a crash, particularly when the buffer is filled up.\n*   **Impact:** Crash of clients and server.\n*   **Attack vector:** Exploitable in-game by using a player with long skin, weapon, or model names, affecting other clients joining the server.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:**  An in-game client, and any client joining or playing on the server with the attacker can be crashed."
