### CVE-2006-1730
Here's the relevant information about CVE-2006-1730 based on the provided text:

*   **Vulnerability:** Integer overflow in Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, Mozilla Suite, and SeaMonkey caused by a large number in the CSS letter-spacing property.
*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of the CSS "letter-spacing" element. Specifying a large number can overflow an integer used during memory allocation.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by persuading a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious email.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. Attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations.
*   **Affected Products/Versions:**
    *   Mozilla Firefox 1.x before 1.5.0.2 and 1.0.x before 1.0.8
    *   Mozilla Suite before 1.7.13
    *   SeaMonkey before 1.0.1
    *   Thunderbird 1.x before 1.5.0.2 and 1.0.x before 1.0.8
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page with a large CSS letter-spacing value.
*   **Exploit Details:**
    *   The vulnerability lies within the `ComputeTotalWordDimensions()` function, specifically in `nsTextFrame.cpp`.
    *   The `ComputeWordFragmentDimensions()` function calculates dimensions based on the `letter-spacing` attribute.
    *   A large `letter-spacing` value can cause `newWordBufSize` to overflow, leading to an under-allocated buffer.
    *   A subsequent `memcpy` operation then causes a heap overflow.
    *   Successful exploitation requires user interaction (visiting a malicious page or opening a specially crafted email).
