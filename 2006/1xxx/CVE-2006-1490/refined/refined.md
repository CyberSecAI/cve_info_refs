CVE-2006-1490: The html_entity_decode function in PHP 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 and earlier does not properly handle a crafted string containing a NULL byte, which allows remote attackers to read portions of server memory.
```

**Summary of relevant information from the provided documents:**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `html_entity_decode()` function in PHP was found to not be binary safe. Specifically, it did not handle NULL bytes correctly when processing a malformed HTML string, causing a memory disclosure vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of NULL bytes in the `html_entity_decode()` function.
- The function was not binary-safe, leading to unexpected behavior when processing non-textual input.
- Memory disclosure vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read parts of the server's memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of potentially sensitive data from the server memory. The disclosed memory could include PHP code, PHP INI data, or other user data.
- Potential for information leakage.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a URL with a query string containing a NULL byte and other characters that is passed to the vulnerable `html_entity_decode()` function.
- The vulnerability requires a PHP script that calls `html_entity_decode()` with user-controlled input and displays the result to be present on a web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL with a malicious payload to a vulnerable PHP script.
- The target site needs to have a publicly accessible PHP script that uses the `html_entity_decode()` function with user-supplied input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in PHP versions 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is also described as a memory leak issue.
- The specific vulnerability occurs when the `html_entity_decode` function is used with untrusted user input, allowing the attacker to specify a long string that leaks memory.
- The fix was applied in PHP's CVS repository and included in later releases such as 4.4.2-r6 and 5.1.4-r4 and later.

The html\_entity\_decode() PHP function was found to not be binary safe. An
attacker could use this flaw to disclose a certain part of the memory. In
order for this issue to be exploitable the target site would need to have a
PHP script which called the "html\_entity\_decode()" function with untrusted
input from the user and displayed the result. (CVE-2006-1490)

An information disclosure has been reported in the
html\_entity\_decode() function. A script which uses this function to
process arbitrary user-supplied input could be exploited to expose a
random part of memory, which could potentially reveal sensitive data.

```
=== Content from support.avaya.com_8cc809a0_20250125_062510.html ===
PHP's html\_entity\_decode() function was discovered not to properly handle
binary content. This could possibly allow a malicious user to disclose the
contents of a certain part of memory. To take advantage of this, an
attacker would have to find a site using the html\_entity\_decode() function
accepting untrusted input from users and showing the results. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-1490](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1490) to this issue.
