| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=191524#c0)  Jason Baron    2006-05-12 18:39:51 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Some time ago, a bug was fixed upstream [1] where a rewrite of the readv/writev code did not include adding appropriate LSM hooks, and these syscalls are unmediated in RHEL4.  Additionally, Al Viro just discovered that the upstream fix neglected the compat code.  This patch fixes both cases.  I've verified the problem and the fix.  Please apply.   Signed-off-by: James Morris <jmorris>   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=191524#c1)  Jason Baron    2006-05-12 18:39:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128948](attachment.cgi?id=128948&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128948&action=edit "patch") patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=191524#c5)  Daniel Riek    2006-05-17 21:08:30 UTC  ``` PM ACK and approving exception request.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=191524#c6)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-05-18 09:50:08 UTC  ``` The reference is the older Fedora [bug 169433](show_bug.cgi?id=169433).    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=191524#c10)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-05-24 09:33:23 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hello,

it seems that readv(2)/writev(2) syscalls do not call
file_permission callback. Looks like this is overlook.

I have filled the issue into redhat bugzilla as
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=169433>
and got the recommendation to post this on lsm mailing list.

The following trivial patch solves the problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-302-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

15 June 2006

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the do\_replace() function. A

local user process with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit

this to execute arbitrary commands with full root privileges.

However, none of Ubuntu's supported packages use this capability with

any non-root user, so this only affects you if you use some third

party software like the OpenVZ virtualization system. ([CVE-2006-0038](/security/CVE-2006-0038))

On EMT64 CPUs, the kernel did not properly handle uncanonical return

addresses. A local user could exploit this to trigger a kernel crash.

([CVE-2006-0744](/security/CVE-2006-0744))

Al Viro discovered a local Denial of Service in the sysfs write buffer

handling. By writing a block with a length exactly equal to the

processor's page size to any writable file in /sys, a local attacker

could cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1055](/security/CVE-2006-1055))

Jan Beulich discovered an information leak in the handling of

registers for the numeric coprocessor when running on AMD processors.

This allowed processes to see the coprocessor execution state of

other processes, which could reveal sensitive data in the case of

cryptographic computations. ([CVE-2006-1056](/security/CVE-2006-1056))

Marcel Holtmann discovered that the sys\_add\_key() did not check that

a new user key is added to a proper keyring. By attempting to add a

key to a normal user key (which is not a keyring), a local attacker

could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1522](/security/CVE-2006-1522))

Ingo Molnar discovered that the SCTP protocol connection tracking

module in netfilter got stuck in an infinite loop on certain empty

packet chunks. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the

computer to hang. ([CVE-2006-1527](/security/CVE-2006-1527))

The SCSI I/O driver did not correctly handle the VM\_IO flag for memory

mapped pages used for data transfer. A local user could exploit this

to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1528](/security/CVE-2006-1528))

The choose\_new\_parent() contained obsolete debugging code. A local

user could exploit this to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1855](/security/CVE-2006-1855))

Kostik Belousov discovered that the readv() and writev() functions did

not query LSM modules for access permission. This could be exploited

to circumvent access restrictions defined by LSM modules such as

SELinux or AppArmor. ([CVE-2006-1856](/security/CVE-2006-1856))

The SCTP driver did not properly verify certain parameters when

receiving a HB-ACK chunk. By sending a specially crafted packet to an

SCTP socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to trigger a buffer

overflow, which could lead to a crash or possibly even arbitrary code

execution. ([CVE-2006-1857](/security/CVE-2006-1857))

The sctp\_walk\_params() function in the SCTP driver incorrectly used

rounded values for bounds checking instead of the precise values. By

sending a specially crafted packet to an SCTP socket, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1858](/security/CVE-2006-1858))

Bjoern Steinbrink reported a memory leak in the \_\_setlease() function.

A local attacker could exploit this to exhaust kernel memory and

render the computer unusable (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1859](/security/CVE-2006-1859))

Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that the lease\_init() did not

properly handle locking. A local attacker could exploit this to cause

a kernel deadlock (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1860](/security/CVE-2006-1860))

Mark Moseley discovered that the CIFS file system driver did not

filter out "..\" path components. A local attacker could exploit this

to break out of a chroot environment on a mounted SMB share.

([CVE-2006-1863](/security/CVE-2006-1863)) The same vulnerability applies to the older smb file

system. ([CVE-2006-1864](/security/CVE-2006-1864))

Hugh Dickins discovered that the mprotect() function allowed an user

to change a read-only shared memory attachment to become writable,

which bypasses IPC (inter-process communication) permissions.

([CVE-2006-2071](/security/CVE-2006-2071))

The SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) driver triggered a

kernel panic on unexpected packets while the session was in the CLOSED

state, instead of silently ignoring the packets. A remote attacker

could exploit this to crash the computer. ([CVE-2006-2271](/security/CVE-2006-2271))

The SCTP driver did not handle control chunks if they arrived in

fragmented packets. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2272](/security/CVE-2006-2272))

The SCTP driver did not correctly handle packets containing more than

one DATA fragment. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2274](/security/CVE-2006-2274))

The SCTP driver did not correcly buffer incoming packets. By sending a

large number of small messages to a receiver application that cannot

process the messages quickly enough, a remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a deadlock in the target machine (Denial of Service).

([CVE-2006-2275](/security/CVE-2006-2275))

Patrick McHardy discovered that the snmp\_trap\_decode() function did

not correctly handle memory allocation in some error conditions. By

sending specially crafted packets to a machine which uses the SNMP

network address translation (NAT), a remote attacker could exploit

this to crash that machine. ([CVE-2006-2444](/security/CVE-2006-2444))

In addition, the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS update fixes a range of bugs.

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 kernel

update has been given a new version number, which requires you to

recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have

installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update

that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel

metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a

standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Last Revised: September 18, 2008

Number: ASA-2006-161

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the issues fixed in the update as reported by Red
Hat:

* a flaw in the IPv6 implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial of service (infinite loop and crash)* a flaw in the bridge implementation that allowed a remote user to cause
    forwarding of spoofed packets via poisoning of the forwarding* a flaw in the atm module that allowed a local user to cause a denial of
      service (panic) via certain socket calls* a flaw in the NFS client implementation that allowed a local user to cause
        a denial of service (panic) via O\_DIRECT writes* a difference in "sysretq" operation of EM64T (as opposed to Opteron)
          processors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) upon
          return from certain system calls* a flaw in the keyring implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
            denial of service (OOPS)* a flaw in IP routing implementation that allowed a local user to cause a
              denial of service (panic) via a request for a route for a multicast IP* a flaw in the SCTP-netfilter implementation that allowed a remote user to
                cause a denial of service (infinite loop)* a flaw in the sg driver that allowed a local user to cause a denial of
                  service (crash) via a dio transfer to memory mapped (mmap) IO space* a flaw in the threading implementation that allowed a local user to cause
                    a denial of service (panic)* two missing LSM hooks that allowed a local user to bypass the LSM by using
                      readv() or writev()* a flaw in the virtual memory implementation that allowed local user to
                        cause a denial of service (panic) by using the lsof command* a directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs that allowed a local user to
                          escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\\" sequences* a flaw in the ECNE chunk handling of SCTP that allowed a remote user to
                            cause a denial of service (panic)* a flaw in the handling of COOKIE\_ECHO and HEARTBEAT control chunks of SCTP
                              that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service (panic)* a flaw in the handling of DATA fragments of SCTP that allowed a remote
                                user to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion and crash)

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers
should determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow that vendors guidance:
