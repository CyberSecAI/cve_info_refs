{
  "CVE-2006-1856": {
    "Description": "The readv() and writev() functions did not query LSM modules for access permission. This could be exploited to circumvent access restrictions defined by LSM modules such as SELinux or AppArmor.",
    "Root cause": "The `readv()` and `writev()` system calls were missing hooks to the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing security checks",
       "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Circumvention of access restrictions imposed by LSM modules (SELinux, AppArmor).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access via `readv()` and `writev()` system calls.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access."
  }
