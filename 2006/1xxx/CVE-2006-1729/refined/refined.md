{
  "CVE-2006-1729": {
    "Description": "A text input box can be pre-filled with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control with the contents intact, allowing a malicious website the ability to steal any local file whose name they can guess.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to change an input field's type from text to file after it has been populated with a file path. This bypasses intended security checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of input type changes.",
      "Lack of validation of the input type before processing the value."
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact is unauthorized file access on the user's system. A malicious website can potentially read and upload any file on the user's filesystem if the path and name are known.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious website loads a page containing a text input field.",
      "The website's script dynamically changes the input field type from 'text' to 'file' after populating the field with a path.",
      "Upon form submission the browser uploads the file specified in the manipulated input."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page that a victim visits."
  }
