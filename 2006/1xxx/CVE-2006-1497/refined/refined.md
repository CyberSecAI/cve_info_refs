    "CVE-2006-1497": {
      "details": "The VihorDesing Script is vulnerable to remote command execution and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to the index.php script using the value of the 'page' parameter in a fopen() call without proper sanitization. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files and the injection of malicious script code.",
