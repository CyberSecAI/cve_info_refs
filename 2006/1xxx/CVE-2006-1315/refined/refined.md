      "Title": "Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-035 - Critical"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "An uninitialized buffer in the Server protocol driver.",
      "Weaknesses": "Information Disclosure vulnerability due to an uninitialized buffer.",
      "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely view contents of the SMB buffers. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly. It could be used to produce useful information to try to further compromise the affected system.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Any user who can deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system can attempt to exploit this vulnerability. On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, an attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not exploited by anonymous users. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have standard user accounts."
    },
        "Mitigating factors": [
            "Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.",
            "For customers who require the affected component, firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.",
              "On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, an attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not exploited by anonymous users. However, the affected component is available remotely to users who have standard user accounts. In certain configurations, anonymous users could authenticate as the Guest account."

        "Workarounds": [
          "Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall: These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected protocol. Blocking them at the firewall, both inbound and outbound, will help prevent systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.",
          "Use a personal firewall, such as the Internet Connection Firewall, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.",
          "Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature to block all unsolicited inbound traffic.",
          "Block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems."
