Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2006-1110, as found in the Exploit-DB entry:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Aztek Forum 4.0 application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when posting messages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly handle specific characters in the URL, leading to a MySQL error which may expose sensitive information such as login credentials. Additionally, during user registration, the application fails to validate long input strings, also triggering a MySQL error that exposes database structure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, retrieve sensitive information like user credentials, or even modify data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** Injecting malicious script within a forum post. The attack is triggered when another user views the post or utilizes the 'cite' functionality. Also, this is possible via the edit functionality after logging in.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Crafting a specific URL request containing the characters "*/*" to trigger the vulnerability. The registration form also provides a vulnerable input for long strings that triggers the error.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to post messages on the forum.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to the forum. For the registration attack, the attacker must be able to register an account on the forum.

**Additional Notes:**
The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) for each vulnerability, demonstrating how to exploit them. The identified vulnerabilities include XSS, and two different SQL injection vulnerabilities.
