Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-1107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `news.php` script of NMDeluxe version 1.0.0 STABLE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `$post['nick']` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
2.  **SQL Injection:** The `$id` variable is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the injected code, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, extract sensitive information, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By submitting a crafted comment containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code via the `news.php` script.
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of the `news.php` script. The vulnerability is triggered when magic_quotes_gpc is turned off.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to submit data to the `news.php` script, typically through the comment functionality.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified parameters to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   For the SQL injection, the server needs to have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to off.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aliaksandr Hartsuyeu from eVuln.com.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit is available.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 1.0.1 of NMDeluxe.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium risk.
