		AMD Background/Response
		Rich Brunner, AMD Fellow

AMD appreciates  the security community  contacting us about
this issue and giving us a chance to respond. Many thanks to
Jan Beulich and Andi Kleen for first  alerting us to the
concern around this issue and trying out several solutions.

Introduction
============
To summarize the issue from AMD's perspective, AMD documents
the  operation of  the  FXSAVE and  FXRSTOR instructions  as
follows  in  the  "AMD64  Architecture  Programmer's  Manual
Volume 5:  64-Bit Media and  x87 Floating-Point Instructions
Rev 3.06":

(<http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/26569.pdf>)

  + FXRSTOR (pg 350):

    "FXRSTOR does  not restore the x87  error pointers (last
     instruction  pointer,  last   data  pointer,  and  last
     opcode), except  in the relatively rare  cases in which
     the exception  summary (ES) bit in the  x87 status word
     is set to 1,  indicating that an unmasked x87 exception
     has occurred."

  + FXSAVE (pg 352):

    "FXSAVE does  not save  the x87 pointer  registers (last
     instruction  pointer,  last   data  pointer,  and  last
     opcode), except  in the relatively rare  cases in which
     the exception  summary (ES) bit in the  x87 status word
     is set to 1,  indicating that an unmasked x87 exception
     has occurred."

AMD purposely designed the  implementation of the FXSAVE and
FXRSTOR  instructions in the  above manner  to significantly
improve the  performance of context-switching.   AMD did not
want to  penalize the performance of  these instructions for
all operating systems for  the relatively rare case when the
exception summary  bit was set  or the unlikely case  of the
x87  exceptions pointers being  successfully exploited  in a
real  customer  environment.    Instead,  AMD  designed  the
instructions to optimize performance for the common case.

As a  result of the operation  of FXSAVE and  FXRSTOR, it is
theoretically possible  for one process  (reader) to observe
the  x87  exception  pointers  of another  process  (writer)
provided that:

  + no  other x87 instructions are executed  that affect the
    x87 exception  pointers between  the time the  writer is
    swapped out and the reader is swapped in; and

  + the  reader does not  have a pending x87  exception when
    swapped back in; and

  + the   reader  does    not  issue  any   non-control  x87
    instructions when  swapped back in  before examining x87
    exception pointers.

Operating  systems can employ one of several simple software
methods to remove the possibility of exploitation as
described  below. In some cases, these methods may actually
*improve* the performance of an operating-system's
context-switching code.

Software Methods
================
There  are  a number  of  methods,  "Clear Sequences",  that
software can  use to ensure that the  x87 exception pointers
(ip, dp,  opcode) are initialized to benign  values on every
context  switch.  Below  are just  a few  examples  of those
methods.

Critical to  the first two methods is  an OS-dependent "safe
address":  this  is  some  location which  can  be  accessed
without  faulting   and  whose   value  is  likely   in  the
processor's L1 data cache. This location will be loaded into
the x87 stack to ensure  that the x87 exception pointers are
set to a benign value.

[Note  that the  Data  Segment Descriptor  (DS)  that is  in
effect  when  the  kernel  executes the  clear  sequence  is
recorded in the x87  exception pointers. Depending on the OS
kernel  and its  mode,  this  DS may  be  from the  previous
process.  To prevent this,  the kernel should ensure that DS
is loaded with a  benign value before executing FXSAVE.  For
example, recent  32-bit Linux  kernels already reload  DS on
kernel entry.]

  + "FXRSTOR-centric" method

    This method sets the  x87 exception pointers to a benign
    state  just before  executing an  FXRSTOR.  It  makes no
    assumption about the state  of the current x87 exception
    pointers before executing  the restore sequence.  In the
    normal case, where ES is not set before the FXRSTOR, the
    "Clear  Sequence"  takes  approximately  14  cycles  (as
    measured on  an AMD Opteron).

  ## Restore Code ...

  ## Begin_Clear_Sequence
	fnstsw	%ax		# Grab x87 ES bit
	ffree	st(7)		# Clear tag bit to remove
				#  -possible stack overflow
	bt	$7,%ax		# Test ES bit
	jnc	1f		# Jump if ES=0
	fnclex			# ES=1, so clear it so fild
				#  -can't trap
1:	fildl	safe_address	# Dummy Load from OS-dependent
				#  -"safe address" changes all
				#  -x87 exception pointers.
  ## End_Clear_Sequence
	fxrstor ...		# Now swap in process state

  + "FXSAVE-centric" method

    This  method  may not  apply  to  all operating  systems
    because  it requires  certain guarantees  between FXSAVE
    and a  subsequent FXRSTOR;  however, this is  the method
    that Linux  will likely choose.  This  approach sets the
    x87  exception pointers  to  a benign  state just  after
    executing an FXSAVE.  Between  that point and entry into
    another x87-using  process, the requirement  is that the
    x87 state  remains benign.  If anything  changes the x87
    exception  pointers in the  interim, then  software must
    clear  out or  save/restore the  state  explicitly again
    before executing an FXRSTOR.

    In  the normal  case,  where  ES is  not  set after  the
    FXSAVE,  the  "Clear  Sequence"  takes  approximately  7
    cycles (as  measured on  an AMD Opteron).   However, the
    added cycles  to the  FXSAVE code may  be much  less for
    operating systems, like  Linux, which currently place an
    unconditional  FNCLEX  after  the  FXSAVE.   The  "Clear
    Sequence"  replaces  the  unconditional  FNCLEX  with  a
    conditional one and may  actually *reduce* the number of
    cycles used for the FXSAVE code.

  ## FXSAVE Code
	fxsave save_image		# save old process state.

  ## Begin_Clear_Sequence
	bt	$7,save_image.fsw	# Test saved ES bit
	jnc	1f			# Jump if ES=0
	fnclex				# ES=1, so clear it so fild
					#  -can't trap
1:	ffree	st(7)			# Clear tag bit to remove
					#  -possible stack overflow
	fildl	safe_address		# Dummy Load from OS-dependent
					#  -"safe address" changes all
					#  -x87 exception pointers.
  ## End_Clear_Sequence
	...
  ## Restore Code
	fxrstor ...			# Now swap in process state

  + FNSAVE and FRSTOR

    32-bit Operating  Systems can  use FNSAVE and  FRSTOR to
    always  save  and  restore  the complete  x87  execution
    state.   However,  because  these  instructions  do  not
    save/restore XMM registers or associated state, software
    must  explicitly perform  this operation.   In addition,
    because FSAVE/FNSAVE  do not  save the full  64-bit data
    and   instruction  pointers   for   x87  state,   64-bit
    applications  should  use  FXSAVE/FXRSTOR,  rather  than
    FSAVE/FRSTOR.

Processors Affected
===================
It  is  AMD's  intent  that all  future  "AuthenticAMD"  AMD
processors  (those  that  return  "AuthenticAMD"  for  CPUID
vendor  string)  will  follow  the behavior  of  FXSAVE  and
FXRSTOR   as   documented   in   the   "AMD64   Architecture
Programmer's   Manual  Volume  5:   64-Bit  Media   and  x87
Floating-Point Instructions  Rev 3.06".  In  addition, these
CPUID Families of  "AuthenticAMD" AMD processors also follow
this behavior:

 + Family=06h:	All 7th generation AMD  processors (such as
		AMD Athlon, AMD Duron, AMD Athlon MP,
		AMD Athlon XP, and AMD Sempron).

 + Family=0Fh:	All 8th generation AMD  processors (such as
		AMD Athlon64, AMD Athlon64 FX, AMD Opteron,
		AMD Turion, and AMD Sempron).

AMD processors which return "Geode by NSCe" for CPUID vendor
string do not follow this behavior.

Debian Bug     :

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2006-0038

    "Solar Designer" discovered that arithmetic computations in netfilter's
    do_replace() function can lead to a buffer overflow and the execution of
    arbitrary code. However, the operation requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges,
    which is only an issue in virtualization systems or fine grained access
    control systems.

CVE-2006-0039

    "Solar Designer" discovered a race condition in netfilter's
    do_add_counters() function, which allows information disclosure of
    kernel memory by exploiting a race condition. Like CVE-2006-0038,
    it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.

CVE-2006-0741

    Intel EM64T systems were discovered to be susceptible to a local
    DoS due to an endless recursive fault related to a bad ELF entry
    address.

CVE-2006-0742

    incorrectly declared die_if_kernel() function as "does never
    return" which could be exploited by a local attacker resulting in
    a kernel crash.

CVE-2006-1056

    AMD64 machines (and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD
    processors) were found to be vulnerable to sensitive information
    leakage, due to how they handle saving and restoring the FOP, FIP,
    and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is
    pending. This allows a process to determine portions of the state
    of floating point instructions of other processes.

CVE-2006-1242

    Marco Ivaldi discovered that there was an unintended information
    disclosure allowing remote attackers to bypass protections against
    Idle Scans (nmap -sI) by abusing the ID field of IP packets and
    bypassing the zero IP ID in DF packet countermeasure. This was a
    result of the ip_push_pending_frames function improperly
    incremented the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving
    unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets.

CVE-2006-1343

    Pavel Kankovsky reported the existance of a potential information leak
    resulting from the failure to initialize sin.sin_zero in the IPv4 socket
    code.

CVE-2006-1368

    Shaun Tancheff discovered a buffer overflow (boundry condition
    error) in the USB Gadget RNDIS implementation allowing remote
    attackers to cause a DoS. While creating a reply message, the
    driver allocated memory for the reply data, but not for the reply
    structure. The kernel fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied
    data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory
    buffer. Attackers could crash the system, or possibly execute
    arbitrary machine code.

CVE-2006-1524

    Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the madvise_remove() function wherein
    file and mmap restrictions are not followed, allowing local users to
    bypass IPC permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with
    zeroes.

CVE-2006-1525

    Alexandra Kossovsky reported a NULL pointer dereference condition in
    ip_route_input() that can be triggered by a local user by requesting
    a route for a multicast IP address, resulting in a denial of service
    (panic).

CVE-2006-1857

    Vlad Yasevich reported a data validation issue in the SCTP subsystem
    that may allow a remote user to overflow a buffer using a badly formatted
    HB-ACK chunk, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2006-1858

    Vlad Yasevich reported a bug in the bounds checking code in the SCTP
    subsystem that may allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service
    attack when rounded parameter lengths are used to calculate parameter
    lengths instead of the actual values.

CVE-2006-1864

    Mark Mosely discovered that chroots residing on an SMB share can be
    escaped with specially crafted "cd" sequences.

CVE-2006-2271

    The "Mu security team" discovered that carefully crafted ECNE chunks can
    cause a kernel crash by accessing incorrect state stable entries in the
    SCTP networking subsystem, which allows denial of service.

CVE-2006-2272

    The "Mu security team" discovered that fragmented SCTP control
    chunks can trigger kernel panics, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.

CVE-2006-2274

    It was discovered that SCTP packets with two initial bundled data
    packets can lead to infinite recursion, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.

The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     Source                      2.4.27-10sarge3

     IBM S/390 architecture      2.4.27-2sarge3
     Sun Sparc architecture      2.4.27-9sarge3

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 3.1 (sarge)
     fai-kernels                 1.9.1sarge2

     systemimager                3.2.3-6sarge2

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Updated kernel packages available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update
4
(RHSA-2006-0575)

Original Release Date: October 12, 2006

Last Revised: October 12, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-200

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 4. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update as
reported
by Red Hat:

* A flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the ACL handling of nfsd that allowed a remote user to
  bypass ACLs
  for readonly mounted NFS file systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter handling that allowed a local user with
  CAP\_NET\_ADMIN rights to cause a buffer overflow.
* A flaw in the IBM S/390 and IBM zSeries strnlen\_user() function that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or to retrieve
  random kernel data.
* A flaw in the keyctl functions that allowed a local user to cause a
  denial of service (crash) or to read sensitive kernel memory
* A flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Itanium processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* A flaw in SELinux ptrace logic that allowed a local user with ptrace
  permissions to change the tracer SID to a SID of another process
* An info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that allowed a
  local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process run by
  a
  different user.
* A flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall.
* A minor info leak in socket option handling in the network code.
* A flaw in the HB-ACK chunk handling of SCTP that allowed a remote
  user to
  cause a denial of service (crash).
* A flaw in the SCTP implementation that allowed a remote user to
  cause a
  denial of service (deadlock).
* A flaw in the socket buffer handling that allowed a remote user to
  cause
  a denial of service (panic).
* A flaw in the signal handling access checking on PowerPC that
  allowed a
  local user to cause a denial of service (crash) or read arbitrary kernel
  memory on 64-bit systems.
* A flaw in the netfilter SCTP module when receiving a chunkless
  packet
  that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of service (crash).
* There were several bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The
  ongoing
  effort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement
  in the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected Kernels installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | CM 1.x to CM 3.x | Low | See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 3.0 and greater | Low | See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Low | See recommended actions below. This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the Linux Kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems. Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the
underlying operating system or applications that come with the operating
system. These vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only
product directly but may threaten the integrity of the underlying
platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform
may be. Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

Updated kernel packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Update 8
(RHSA-2006-0437)

Original Release Date: September 15, 2006

Last Revised: September 15, 2006

Number: ASA-2006-180

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux
operating
system.

Red Hat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages for
Enterprise
Linux 3. Below is a list of the security issues fixed in the update
as
reported by Red Hat:

* a flaw in the USB devio handling of device removal that allowed
  a local
  user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* a flaw in the exec() handling of multi-threaded tasks using
  ptrace()
  that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (hang of
  a user
  process)
* a difference in "sysretq" operation of EM64T (as opposed to
  Opteron)
  processors that allowed a local user to cause a denial of service
  (crash)
  upon return from certain system calls
* a flaw in unaligned accesses handling on Intel Itanium
  processors that
  allowed a local user to cause a denial of service (crash)
* an info leak on AMD-based x86 and x86\_64 systems that
  allowed a local
  user to retrieve the floating point exception state of a process
  run by a
  different user
* a flaw in IPv4 packet output handling that allowed a remote
  user to
  bypass the zero IP ID countermeasure on systems with a disabled
  firewall
* a minor info leak in socket option handling in the network
  code
* a flaw in IPv4 netfilter handling for the unlikely use of
  SNMP NAT
  processing that allowed a remote user to cause a denial of
  service (crash)
  or potential memory corruption

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2005-3055](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3055),

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected kernel packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300 | all versions of CM | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of the kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict
local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through
the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted networking practices until such time as an
update becomes
available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product
directly but
may threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by
the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the
product was
installed and then follow that vendors guidance:

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Interactive Response(IR) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IR application. The IR application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected packages may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | Low | See recommended actions below. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by the Operating System vendor (e.g.
RedHat
Linux) or remove the affected packages.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya

| [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c7)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-19 12:01:09 UTC  ``` An information leak has been reported that affects the Linux kernel running on certain AMD processors ([CVE-2006-1056](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1056)). This issue is due to the behavior of FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions on AMD processors is different from the behavior on Intel processors. The difference is documented in "AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 5: 64-Bit Media and x87 Floating-Point Instructions Rev 3.06". This difference was not widely known and therefore Linux kernels assumed these instructions would have same behavior as on Intel processors.  Under specific conditions this may allow a local user to observe the x87 exception pointers of another process. Although this is a minor information leak, if the floating point unit is being used for a cryptographic algorithm this could potentially leak some or all of key data.  According to AMD, this will affect processors with "AuthenticAMD" in the CPUID vendor string. This includes the 7th generation (Family=06h) and 8th generation (Family=0Fh) of AMD processors.  This issue has been rated as having important security severity and it affects all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4 versions running on AMD processors of the 7th and 8th generation.    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c9)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-19 23:07:16 UTC  ``` Response from AMD:  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114548768214478&w=2>    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c10)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-29 20:40:44 UTC  ``` The patch introduced a bug in FP exception handling:  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114633448824132&w=2>    ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c12)  Jason Baron    2006-06-23 18:10:54 UTC  ``` committed in stream U4 build 39.2. A test kernel with this patch is available from <http://people.redhat.com/~jbaron/rhel>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c14)  Mike Gahagan    2006-07-14 19:58:39 UTC  ``` Patch is in -42.EL.    ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=187910#c16)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-08-10 23:02:29 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c3)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-19 12:02:46 UTC  ``` An information leak has been reported that affects the Linux kernel running on certain AMD processors ([CVE-2006-1056](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1056)). This issue is due to the behavior of FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions on AMD processors is different from the behavior on Intel processors. The difference is documented in "AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual Volume 5: 64-Bit Media and x87 Floating-Point Instructions Rev 3.06". This difference was not widely known and therefore Linux kernels assumed these instructions would have same behavior as on Intel processors.  Under specific conditions this may allow a local user to observe the x87 exception pointers of another process. Although this is a minor information leak, if the floating point unit is being used for a cryptographic algorithm this could potentially leak some or all of key data.  According to AMD, this will affect processors with "AuthenticAMD" in the CPUID vendor string. This includes the 7th generation (Family=06h) and 8th generation (Family=0Fh) of AMD processors.  This issue has been rated as having important security severity and it affects all Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4 versions running on AMD processors of the 7th and 8th generation.    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c5)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-19 23:10:00 UTC  ``` Response from AMD:  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114548768214478&w=2>    ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c6)  Ernie Petrides    2006-04-22 09:04:09 UTC  ``` A fix for this problem has just been committed to the RHEL3 U8 patch pool this evening (in kernel version 2.4.21-40.9.EL).    ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c7)  Marcel Holtmann    2006-04-29 20:41:40 UTC  ``` The patch introduced a bug in FP exception handling:  <http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=114633448824132&w=2>    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c8)  Ernie Petrides    2006-05-01 18:34:59 UTC  ``` Thanks, Marcel.  As it turns out, the patch committed to RHEL3 uses a "C" statement to perform the test, and the compiler generated the correct code.  Thus, no regression was caused in RHEL3.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=187911#c11)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2006-07-20 14:02:37 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006-0437.html>    ``` |  |

AMD Background/Response
Rich Brunner, AMD Fellow
AMD appreciates the security community contacting us about
this issue and giving us a chance to respond. Many thanks to
Jan Beulich and Andi Kleen for first alerting us to the
concern around this issue and trying out several solutions.
Introduction
============
To summarize the issue from AMD's perspective, AMD documents
the operation of the FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions as
follows in the "AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual
Volume 5: 64-Bit Media and x87 Floating-Point Instructions
Rev 3.06":
(http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content\_type/white\_papers\_and\_tech\_docs/26569.pdf)
+ FXRSTOR (pg 350):
"FXRSTOR does not restore the x87 error pointers (last
instruction pointer, last data pointer, and last
opcode), except in the relatively rare cases in which
the exception summary (ES) bit in the x87 status word
is set to 1, indicating that an unmasked x87 exception
has occurred."
+ FXSAVE (pg 352):
"FXSAVE does not save the x87 pointer registers (last
instruction pointer, last data pointer, and last
opcode), except in the relatively rare cases in which
the exception summary (ES) bit in the x87 status word
is set to 1, indicating that an unmasked x87 exception
has occurred."
AMD purposely designed the implementation of the FXSAVE and
FXRSTOR instructions in the above manner to significantly
improve the performance of context-switching. AMD did not
want to penalize the performance of these instructions for
all operating systems for the relatively rare case when the
exception summary bit was set or the unlikely case of the
x87 exceptions pointers being successfully exploited in a
real customer environment. Instead, AMD designed the
instructions to optimize performance for the common case.
As a result of the operation of FXSAVE and FXRSTOR, it is
theoretically possible for one process (reader) to observe
the x87 exception pointers of another process (writer)
provided that:
+ no other x87 instructions are executed that affect the
x87 exception pointers between the time the writer is
swapped out and the reader is swapped in; and
+ the reader does not have a pending x87 exception when
swapped back in; and
+ the reader does not issue any non-control x87
instructions when swapped back in before examining x87
exception pointers.
Operating systems can employ one of several simple software
methods to remove the possibility of exploitation as
described below. In some cases, these methods may actually
\*improve\* the performance of an operating-system's
context-switching code.
Software Methods
================
There are a number of methods, "Clear Sequences", that
software can use to ensure that the x87 exception pointers
(ip, dp, opcode) are initialized to benign values on every
context switch. Below are just a few examples of those
methods.
Critical to the first two methods is an OS-dependent "safe
address": this is some location which can be accessed
without faulting and whose value is likely in the
processor's L1 data cache. This location will be loaded into
the x87 stack to ensure that the x87 exception pointers are
set to a benign value.
[Note that the Data Segment Descriptor (DS) that is in
effect when the kernel executes the clear sequence is
recorded in the x87 exception pointers. Depending on the OS
kernel and its mode, this DS may be from the previous
process. To prevent this, the kernel should ensure that DS
is loaded with a benign value before executing FXSAVE. For
example, recent 32-bit Linux kernels already reload DS on
kernel entry.]
+ "FXRSTOR-centric" method
This method sets the x87 exception pointers to a benign
state just before executing an FXRSTOR. It makes no
assumption about the state of the current x87 exception
pointers before executing the restore sequence. In the
normal case, where ES is not set before the FXRSTOR, the
"Clear Sequence" takes approximately 14 cycles (as
measured on an AMD Opteron).
## Restore Code ...
## Begin\_Clear\_Sequence
fnstsw %ax # Grab x87 ES bit
ffree st(7) # Clear tag bit to remove
# -possible stack overflow
bt $7,%ax # Test ES bit
jnc 1f # Jump if ES=0
fnclex # ES=1, so clear it so fild
# -can't trap
1: fildl safe\_address # Dummy Load from OS-dependent
# -"safe address" changes all
# -x87 exception pointers.
## End\_Clear\_Sequence
fxrstor ... # Now swap in process state
+ "FXSAVE-centric" method
This method may not apply to all operating systems
because it requires certain guarantees between FXSAVE
and a subsequent FXRSTOR; however, this is the method
that Linux will likely choose. This approach sets the
x87 exception pointers to a benign state just after
executing an FXSAVE. Between that point and entry into
another x87-using process, the requirement is that the
x87 state remains benign. If anything changes the x87
exception pointers in the interim, then software must
clear out or save/restore the state explicitly again
before executing an FXRSTOR.
In the normal case, where ES is not set after the
FXSAVE, the "Clear Sequence" takes approximately 7
cycles (as measured on an AMD Opteron). However, the
added cycles to the FXSAVE code may be much less for
operating systems, like Linux, which currently place an
unconditional FNCLEX after the FXSAVE. The "Clear
Sequence" replaces the unconditional FNCLEX with a
conditional one and may actually \*reduce\* the number of
cycles used for the FXSAVE code.
## FXSAVE Code
fxsave save\_image # save old process state.
## Begin\_Clear\_Sequence
bt $7,save\_image.fsw # Test saved ES bit
jnc 1f # Jump if ES=0
fnclex # ES=1, so clear it so fild
# -can't trap
1: ffree st(7) # Clear tag bit to remove
# -possible stack overflow
fildl safe\_address # Dummy Load from OS-dependent
# -"safe address" changes all
# -x87 exception pointers.
## End\_Clear\_Sequence
...
## Restore Code
fxrstor ... # Now swap in process state
+ FNSAVE and FRSTOR
32-bit Operating Systems can use FNSAVE and FRSTOR to
always save and restore the complete x87 execution
state. However, because these instructions do not
save/restore XMM registers or associated state, software
must explicitly perform this operation. In addition,
because FSAVE/FNSAVE do not save the full 64-bit data
and instruction pointers for x87 state, 64-bit
applications should use FXSAVE/FXRSTOR, rather than
FSAVE/FRSTOR.
Processors Affected
===================
It is AMD's intent that all future "AuthenticAMD" AMD
processors (those that return "AuthenticAMD" for CPUID
vendor string) will follow the behavior of FXSAVE and
FXRSTOR as documented in the "AMD64 Architecture
Programmer's Manual Volume 5: 64-Bit Media and x87
Floating-Point Instructions Rev 3.06". In addition, these
CPUID Families of "AuthenticAMD" AMD processors also follow
this behavior:
+ Family=06h: All 7th generation AMD processors (such as
AMD Athlon, AMD Duron, AMD Athlon MP,
AMD Athlon XP, and AMD Sempron).
+ Family=0Fh: All 8th generation AMD processors (such as
AMD Athlon64, AMD Athlon64 FX, AMD Opteron,
AMD Turion, and AMD Sempron).
AMD processors which return "Geode by NSCe" for CPUID vendor
string do not follow this behavior.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-302-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

15 June 2006

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)
* [Ubuntu 5.10](/security/notices?release=breezy)
* [Ubuntu 5.04](/security/notices?release=hoary)

## Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the do\_replace() function. A

local user process with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability could exploit

this to execute arbitrary commands with full root privileges.

However, none of Ubuntu's supported packages use this capability with

any non-root user, so this only affects you if you use some third

party software like the OpenVZ virtualization system. ([CVE-2006-0038](/security/CVE-2006-0038))

On EMT64 CPUs, the kernel did not properly handle uncanonical return

addresses. A local user could exploit this to trigger a kernel crash.

([CVE-2006-0744](/security/CVE-2006-0744))

Al Viro discovered a local Denial of Service in the sysfs write buffer

handling. By writing a block with a length exactly equal to the

processor's page size to any writable file in /sys, a local attacker

could cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1055](/security/CVE-2006-1055))

Jan Beulich discovered an information leak in the handling of

registers for the numeric coprocessor when running on AMD processors.

This allowed processes to see the coprocessor execution state of

other processes, which could reveal sensitive data in the case of

cryptographic computations. ([CVE-2006-1056](/security/CVE-2006-1056))

Marcel Holtmann discovered that the sys\_add\_key() did not check that

a new user key is added to a proper keyring. By attempting to add a

key to a normal user key (which is not a keyring), a local attacker

could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1522](/security/CVE-2006-1522))

Ingo Molnar discovered that the SCTP protocol connection tracking

module in netfilter got stuck in an infinite loop on certain empty

packet chunks. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the

computer to hang. ([CVE-2006-1527](/security/CVE-2006-1527))

The SCSI I/O driver did not correctly handle the VM\_IO flag for memory

mapped pages used for data transfer. A local user could exploit this

to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1528](/security/CVE-2006-1528))

The choose\_new\_parent() contained obsolete debugging code. A local

user could exploit this to cause a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-1855](/security/CVE-2006-1855))

Kostik Belousov discovered that the readv() and writev() functions did

not query LSM modules for access permission. This could be exploited

to circumvent access restrictions defined by LSM modules such as

SELinux or AppArmor. ([CVE-2006-1856](/security/CVE-2006-1856))

The SCTP driver did not properly verify certain parameters when

receiving a HB-ACK chunk. By sending a specially crafted packet to an

SCTP socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to trigger a buffer

overflow, which could lead to a crash or possibly even arbitrary code

execution. ([CVE-2006-1857](/security/CVE-2006-1857))

The sctp\_walk\_params() function in the SCTP driver incorrectly used

rounded values for bounds checking instead of the precise values. By

sending a specially crafted packet to an SCTP socket, a remote

attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-1858](/security/CVE-2006-1858))

Bjoern Steinbrink reported a memory leak in the \_\_setlease() function.

A local attacker could exploit this to exhaust kernel memory and

render the computer unusable (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1859](/security/CVE-2006-1859))

Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that the lease\_init() did not

properly handle locking. A local attacker could exploit this to cause

a kernel deadlock (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-1860](/security/CVE-2006-1860))

Mark Moseley discovered that the CIFS file system driver did not

filter out "..\" path components. A local attacker could exploit this

to break out of a chroot environment on a mounted SMB share.

([CVE-2006-1863](/security/CVE-2006-1863)) The same vulnerability applies to the older smb file

system. ([CVE-2006-1864](/security/CVE-2006-1864))

Hugh Dickins discovered that the mprotect() function allowed an user

to change a read-only shared memory attachment to become writable,

which bypasses IPC (inter-process communication) permissions.

([CVE-2006-2071](/security/CVE-2006-2071))

The SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) driver triggered a

kernel panic on unexpected packets while the session was in the CLOSED

state, instead of silently ignoring the packets. A remote attacker

could exploit this to crash the computer. ([CVE-2006-2271](/security/CVE-2006-2271))

The SCTP driver did not handle control chunks if they arrived in

fragmented packets. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2272](/security/CVE-2006-2272))

The SCTP driver did not correctly handle packets containing more than

one DATA fragment. By sending specially crafted packets to an SCTP

socket, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the target

machine. ([CVE-2006-2274](/security/CVE-2006-2274))

The SCTP driver did not correcly buffer incoming packets. By sending a

large number of small messages to a receiver application that cannot

process the messages quickly enough, a remote attacker could exploit

this to cause a deadlock in the target machine (Denial of Service).

([CVE-2006-2275](/security/CVE-2006-2275))

Patrick McHardy discovered that the snmp\_trap\_decode() function did

not correctly handle memory allocation in some error conditions. By

sending specially crafted packets to a machine which uses the SNMP

network address translation (NAT), a remote attacker could exploit

this to crash that machine. ([CVE-2006-2444](/security/CVE-2006-2444))

In addition, the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS update fixes a range of bugs.

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 kernel

update has been given a new version number, which requires you to

recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have

installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update

that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel

metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a

standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

An update that fixes 47 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 1 LTSS Xen
hypervisor and toolset have been updated to fix various
security issues and some bugs.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1894: Xen 3.2 (and presumably
earlier) exhibit both problems with the overflow issue
being present for more than just the suboperations listed
above. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1892 CVE-2014-1893: Xen 3.3 through
4.1, while not affected by the above overflow, have a
different overflow issue on FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL and expose
unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests.
(bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-84: CVE-2014-1891: The FLASK\_{GET,SET}BOOL,
FLASK\_USER and FLASK\_CONTEXT\_TO\_SID suboperations of the
flask hypercall are vulnerable to an integer overflow on
the input size. The hypercalls attempt to allocate a buffer
which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore
vulnerable to integer overflow and an attempt to allocate
then access a zero byte buffer. (bnc#860163)
\*
XSA-82: CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h
through 0Fh processors does not properly handle the
interaction between locked instructions and write-combined
memory types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#853049)
\*
XSA-76: CVE-2013-4554: Xen 3.0.3 through 4.1.x
(possibly 4.1.6.1), 4.2.x (possibly 4.2.3), and 4.3.x
(possibly 4.3.1) does not properly prevent access to
hypercalls, which allows local guest users to gain
privileges via a crafted application running in ring 1 or
2. (bnc#849668)
\*
XSA-74: CVE-2013-4553: The XEN\_DOMCTL\_getmemlist
hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does
not always obtain the page\_alloc\_lock and mm\_rwlock in the
same order, which allows local guest administrators to
cause a denial of service (host deadlock). (bnc#849667)
\*
XSA-73: CVE-2013-4494: Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and
4.3.x does not take the page\_alloc\_lock and
grant\_table.lock in the same order, which allows local
guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause
a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#848657)
\*
XSA-67: CVE-2013-4368: The outs instruction emulation
in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or
GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a
segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain
sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via
unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment
register. (bnc#842511)
\*
XSA-66: CVE-2013-4361: The fbld instruction emulation
in Xen 3.3.x through 4.3.x does not use the correct
variable for the source effective address, which allows
local HVM guests to obtain hypervisor stack information by
reading the values used by the instruction. (bnc#841766)
\*
XSA-63: CVE-2013-4355: Xen 4.3.x and earlier does not
properly handle certain errors, which allows local HVM
guests to obtain hypervisor stack memory via a (1) port or
(2) memory mapped I/O write or (3) other unspecified
operations related to addresses without associated memory.
(bnc#840592)
\*
XSA-62: CVE-2013-1442: Xen 4.0 through 4.3.x, when
using AVX or LWP capable CPUs, does not properly clear
previous data from registers when using an XSAVE or XRSTOR
to extend the state components of a saved or restored vCPU
after touching other restored extended registers, which
allows local guest OSes to obtain sensitive information by
reading the registers. (bnc#839596)
\*
XSA-61: CVE-2013-4329: The xenlight library (libxl)
in Xen 4.0.x through 4.2.x, when IOMMU is disabled,
provides access to a busmastering-capable PCI passthrough
device before the IOMMU setup is complete, which allows
local HVM guest domains to gain privileges or cause a
denial of service via a DMA instruction. (bnc#839618)
\*
XSA-60: CVE-2013-2212: The vmx\_set\_uc\_mode function
in Xen 3.3 through 4.3, when disabling chaches, allows
local HVM guests with access to memory mapped I/O regions
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and possibly
hypervisor or guest kernel panic) via a crafted GFN range.
(bnc#831120)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-58: CVE-2013-1432: Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the
XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain
references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which
allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service
(premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possible gain
privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#826882)
\*
XSA-57: CVE-2013-2211: The libxenlight (libxl)
toolstack library in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x uses weak
permissions for xenstore keys for paravirtualised and
emulated serial console devices, which allows local guest
administrators to modify the xenstore value via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#823608)
\*
XSA-56: CVE-2013-2072: Buffer overflow in the Python
bindings for the xc\_vcpu\_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x,
4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with
permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and
possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap. (bnc#819416)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2196: Multiple unspecified
vulnerabilities in the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and
earlier allow local guest administrators with certain
permissions to have an unspecified impact via a crafted
kernel, related to "other problems" that are not
CVE-2013-2194 or CVE-2013-2195. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2195: The Elf parser (libelf) in Xen
4.2.x and earlier allow local guest administrators with
certain permissions to have an unspecified impact via a
crafted kernel, related to "pointer dereferences" involving
unexpected calculations. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-55: CVE-2013-2194: Multiple integer overflows in
the Elf parser (libelf) in Xen 4.2.x and earlier allow
local guest administrators with certain permissions to have
an unspecified impact via a crafted kernel. (bnc#823011)
\*
XSA-53: CVE-2013-2077: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x
does not properly restrict the contents of a XRSTOR, which
allows local PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(unhandled exception and hypervisor crash) via unspecified
vectors. (bnc#820919)
\*
XSA-52: CVE-2013-2076: Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x,
when running on AMD64 processors, only save/restore the
FOP, FIP, and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an
exception is pending, which allows one domain to determine
portions of the state of floating point instructions of
other domains, which can be leveraged to obtain sensitive
information such as cryptographic keys, a similar
vulnerability to CVE-2006-1056. NOTE: this is the
documented behavior of AMD64 processors, but it is
inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant
fashion that was not addressed by the kernels. (bnc#820917)
\*
XSA-50: CVE-2013-1964: Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x
incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a
non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest
administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash),
obtain sensitive information, or possible have other
impacts via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816156)
\*
XSA-49: CVE-2013-1952: Xen 4.x, when using Intel VT-d
for a bus mastering capable PCI device, does not properly
check the source when accessing a bridge device's interrupt
remapping table entries for MSI interrupts, which allows
local guest domains to cause a denial of service (interrupt
injection) via unspecified vectors. (bnc#816163)
\*
XSA-47: CVE-2013-1920: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier,
when the hypervisor is running "under memory pressure" and
the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong
ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event
channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and
allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and
gain privileges via unspecified vectors. (bnc#813677)
\*
XSA-46: CVE-2013-1919: Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not
properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub
domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of
service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI
devices." (bnc#813675)
\*
XSA-45: CVE-2013-1918: Certain page table
manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier
are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause
a denial of service via vectors related to "deep page table
traversal." (bnc#816159)
\*
XSA-44: CVE-2013-1917: Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when
running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT
flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which
allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service
(hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not
properly handled by another IRET instruction. (bnc#813673)
\*
XSA-41: CVE-2012-6075: Buffer overflow in the
e1000\_receive function in the e1000 device driver
(hw/e1000.c) in QEMU 1.3.0-rc2 and other versions, when the
SBP and LPE flags are disabled, allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary guest code via a large packet.
(bnc#797523)
\*
XSA-37: CVE-2013-0154: The get\_page\_type function in
xen/arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.2, when debugging is enabled,
allows local PV or HVM guest administrators to cause a
denial of service (assertion failure and hypervisor crash)
via unspecified vectors related to a hypercall. (bnc#797031)
\*
XSA-36: CVE-2013-0153: The AMD IOMMU support in Xen
4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi
for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping
table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to
cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into
other guests. (bnc#800275)
\*
XSA-33: CVE-2012-5634: Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and 4.0,
when using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough, does not
properly configure VT-d when supporting a device that is
behind a legacy PCI Bridge, which allows local guests to
cause a denial of service to other guests by injecting an
interrupt. (bnc#794316)
\*
XSA-31: CVE-2012-5515: The (1)
XENMEM\_decrease\_reservation, (2) XENMEM\_populate\_physmap,
and (3) XENMEM\_exchange hypercalls in Xen 4.2 and earlier
allow local guest administrators to cause a denial of
service (long loop and hang) via a crafted extent\_order
value. (bnc#789950)
\*
XSA-30: CVE-2012-5514: The
guest\_physmap\_mark\_populate\_on\_demand function in Xen 4.2
and earlier does not properly unlock the subject GFNs when
checking if they are in use, which allows local guest HVM
administrators to cause a denial of service (hang) via
unspecified vectors. (bnc#789948)
\*
XSA-29: CVE-2012-5513: The XENMEM\_exchange handler in
Xen 4.2 and earlier does not properly check the memory
address, which allows local PV guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified vectors that overwrite memory in
the hypervisor reserved range. (bnc#789951)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-6333: Multiple HVM control
operations in Xen 3.4 through 4.2 allow local HVM guest OS
administrators to cause a denial of service (physical CPU
consumption) via a large input. (bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-27: CVE-2012-5511: Stack-based buffer overflow in
the dirty video RAM tracking functionality in Xen 3.4
through 4.1 allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
cause a denial of service (crash) via a large bitmap image.
(bnc#789944)
\*
XSA-26: CVE-2012-5510: Xen 4.x, when downgrading the
grant table version, does not properly remove the status
page from the tracking list when freeing the page, which
allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#789945)
\*
XSA-25: CVE-2012-4544: The PV domain builder in Xen
4.2 and earlier does not validate the size of the kernel or
ramdisk (1) before or (2) after decompression, which allows
local guest administrators to cause a denial of service
(domain 0 memory consumption) via a crafted (a) kernel or
(b) ramdisk. (bnc#787163)
\*
XSA-24: CVE-2012-4539: Xen 4.0 through 4.2, when
running 32-bit x86 PV guests on 64-bit hypervisors, allows
local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and hang or crash) via invalid arguments to
GNTTABOP\_get\_status\_frames, aka "Grant table hypercall
infinite loop DoS vulnerability." (bnc#786520)
\*
XSA-23: CVE-2012-4538: The HVMOP\_pagetable\_dying
hypercall in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly check
the pagetable state when running on shadow pagetables,
which allows a local HVM guest OS to cause a denial of
service (hypervisor crash) via unspecified vectors.
(bnc#786519)
\*
XSA-22: CVE-2012-4537: Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and
possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize
the p2m and m2p tables when the set\_p2m\_entry function
fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to
