```
{
  "CVE-2006-1056": {
    "Root cause": "The FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions on AMD processors do not save/restore the x87 exception pointers (last instruction pointer, last data pointer, and last opcode) unless the exception summary (ES) bit in the x87 status word is set to 1.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information exposure",
      "Inconsistent behavior between AMD and Intel processors"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user could theoretically observe the x87 exception pointers of another process, potentially leaking sensitive data like cryptographic keys if the FPU is used for cryptographic operations.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access, process to process information leakage via FPU registers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to run code on the same system as the victim. No elevated privileges required."
