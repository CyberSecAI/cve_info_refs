Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2006-1190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Internet Explorer handles the `IOleClientSite` interface when a dynamic embedded object is created. Specifically, IE may return erroneous `IOleClientSite` information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Handling of `IOleClientSite`:** When an embedded object is created dynamically, Internet Explorer incorrectly provides the object with information about its container. This information is retrieved through the `IOleClientSite` interface. The object might use this information to make security decisions. This can lead to the object running in the context of the wrong security zone.
-   **Incorrect Security Context:** Due to the incorrect `IOleClientSite` information, the embedded object may operate within the context of an unintended security zone, bypassing the intended security restrictions. This can lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can lead to complete control over the system.
-   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability might also lead to unauthorized information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage containing a dynamically created embedded object that exploits the vulnerability.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have any existing user credentials.
-   **Web Server and Website:** The attacker needs to control a webserver hosting malicious content.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into accessing the malicious website.

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   The `IOleClientSite` interface is used by embedded objects to obtain information about their container, including location, extent, moniker, UI and other resources.
-   This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious web page containing a dynamically created embedded object which then makes use of the flawed IOleClientSite information.

**Affected Systems:**

-   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions prior to the patch, excluding Internet Explorer 5.01 SP4 on Windows 2000 SP4.
-   The advisory notes that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 mitigates the vulnerability in the e-mail vector due to Enhanced Security Configuration.
-   The vulnerability affects the same systems as listed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-013

**Mitigation:**

- The primary solution is to apply the security update provided by Microsoft.
- Workarounds involve changing security settings for Internet Explorer including: prompting before running ActiveX controls or disabling them, prompting before running active scripting or disabling it, or setting security settings to "High".
