There are a couple of addons for CoreNews available here:

  <http://corenews.icestyle.de/>

The next-page and page-direktlinks hacks seem to add the functionality:

  <http://corenews.icestyle.de/download/nextpage.howto-install.hack>
  <http://corenews.icestyle.de/download/new_next-page>

through changes to shownews.php. Also worth noting is the presence of an
eval() in the original source, although it seems like most of the mods
from these two addons occur *after* the eval. Then again,

At least you have the source - <<http://www.php-spezial.de/>> isn't
working for me.

P.S. I'm new to the list and hope I'm not violating protocol by jumping
in like this.
