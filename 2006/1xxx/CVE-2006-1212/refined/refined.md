Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The CoreNews 2.0.1 application contains an `eval()` function call in its `shownews.php` file.
*   **Weakness:** The use of `eval()` on unsanitized or attacker-controlled input is a classic vulnerability. It allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can manipulate the input passed to `eval()`.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the server hosting CoreNews, including data theft, malware injection, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker could potentially manipulate variables passed to `shownews.php` (most likely through HTTP GET/POST parameters) to inject arbitrary PHP code into the `eval()` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to identify the input variables passed to `eval()` and be able to send malicious input via HTTP requests. Specific exploitation details are not provided, but typically this involves crafting a specific request with malicious PHP code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that some add-ons ("next-page" and "page-direktlinks") for CoreNews modify `shownews.php` which might make the vulnerability context more complex.
*   The provided links to the add-ons, and the original source are unfortunately dead, so the exact code containing the vulnerable `eval()` function cannot be examined.

**Summary:**

The core issue is the presence of an `eval()` statement in `shownews.php`. This vulnerability is present in CoreNews 2.0.1 and can allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This is a clear example of a Remote Command Execution vulnerability.
