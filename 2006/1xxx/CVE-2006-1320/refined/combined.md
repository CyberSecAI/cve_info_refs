How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

![](/cgi-bin/libravatar.cgi?email=rra%40debian.org)
From: Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>
To: Debian Bug Tracking System <submit@bugs.debian.org>
Subject: rssh runs cvs for rdist and rsync, doesn't check cvs -e
Date: Fri, 06 Jan 2006 16:29:45 -0800
```
Package: rssh
Version: 2.3.0-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security patch
Justification: renders package unusable

Due to missing curly braces in util.c, if rssh gets as far as checking
to see if the issued command was CVS, the check will always succeed.
Furthermore, this failure can be exploited to pass -e options to CVS,
since the command invoked will actually be /usr/bin/cvs and the security
check for -e options will be bypassed.

This breaks all use of rsync and rdist since /usr/bin/cvs is actually
invoked instead of those programs.  It also bypasses all security
checking from rssh.conf if the check for what program to run gets that
far.

I've confirmed that the attached trivial patch fixes the problem.

Ack, sorry, here's the patch.

Upstream reports they've released a new version of rssh (2.3.2) which is
now mentioned on the rssh home page.  It looks like this release should
also fix Bug#339531.

The problems in 2.3.0 sound like they were introduced in that version and
wouldn't affect previous versions (although of course previous versions
have the chroot problem fixed in 2.3.0).

Subject: Intention to NMU rssh for security vulnerability
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2006 13:35:28 -0800
```
Hi Jesus,

I haven't heard anything back about this bug (#346322), which is a serious
security vulnerability affecting unstable and testing.

I've checked the latest upstream release (2.3.2) and compared it to 2.3.0
currently in Debian, and the following patch fixes this vulnerability and
another segfault issue.  I intend to upload an NMU for rssh applying this
patch on Monday (March 20th) if I haven't heard back from you saying to
hold off.

Please let me know if you need any help or have any questions or concerns,
or if you have an upload prepared already for this problem.

Changes:
 rssh (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New co-maintainer.
   * New upstream release.
     - Incorporates fixes from NMU.  (Closes: #[346322](bugreport.cgi?bug=346322), #[355935](bugreport.cgi?bug=355935), #[357715](bugreport.cgi?bug=357715))
     - Incorporates missing va_end also fixed in NMU.  (Closes: #[339531](bugreport.cgi?bug=339531))
   * Don't compress example scripts.  (Closes: #[333923](bugreport.cgi?bug=333923))
   * Mention chroot and jail in the rssh description.  (Closes: #[335475](bugreport.cgi?bug=335475))
   * Add libnss_compat* to the chroot script.  (Closes: #[335384](bugreport.cgi?bug=335384))
   * Drop the ssh-krb5 alternative; it doesn't use the right sftp-server
     path.  Add Suggests pointing to the other supported commands.
   * Drop the configuration caution from the package description; it's in
     the man page and the long description isn't supposed to include
     configuration information for the package.
   * Rework README.Debian a little to point to the rssh man page instead of
     SECURITY (upstream moved the security notes there) and emphasize
     reading the documentation before using the package.
   * Update logcheck rules.
   * debian/rules and debian/control cleanup.
     - Switch to quilt for patches.  It works essentially the same as the
       script the package was using but is more standard and is the current
       recommended tool.
     - Run dh_shlibdeps to pick up proper dependency information.
     - Get the debconf dependency from debhelper.
     - Use debian/compat instead of setting DH_COMPAT.
     - Use dh_installman instead of the deprecated dh_installmanpages.
     - Remove duplicate rssh.docs configuration file.
     - Don't install config.{guess,sub}; configure doesn't use them.
     - Rename NEWS.Debian to NEWS so that debhelper installs it.
     - Install logcheck rules with debhelper.
     - Simplify unused rules and remove some boilerplate.
   * Translation updates.
     - Swedish, thanks Daniel Nylander.  (Closes: #[341412](bugreport.cgi?bug=341412))
