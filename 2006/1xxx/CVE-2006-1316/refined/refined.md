  "CVE-2006-1316": {
    "Root cause": "Microsoft Office fails to properly handle specially crafted strings within Office files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of strings leading to memory corruption.",
      "Insufficient input validation when parsing malformed strings in Office files"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted Office file, such as through an email attachment",
      "Visiting a malicious website hosting a malicious Office file or content that exploits the vulnerability."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a malformed Office file. The attacker must convince a user to open the file via email, website or other means.",
   "More detail": "The vulnerability occurs when Office applications parse malformed strings within Office documents, potentially corrupting system memory in such a way that allows for arbitrary code execution."
