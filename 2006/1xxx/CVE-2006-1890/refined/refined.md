Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2006-1890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `myevent_path` variable not being properly sanitized or validated in the `event.php` and `initialize.php` files of the MyEvent script. This allows an attacker to inject an external URL into the `$myevent_path` variable via the query string.
*   The injected URL is then used in an `include` or `include_once` statement, enabling the attacker to include remote files from their controlled server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application includes external content without validating its source or content.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The text also mentions XSS attacks as a related issue, which could be a secondary impact due to the remote code inclusion or a separate vulnerability in the script. This is not explicitly detailed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable MyEvent script.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `initialize.php` code also includes the configuration file (`config.php`). By including an external file, attacker could be able to overwrite and/or include the file, therefore leading to possible credentials disclosure.
*   **XSS:** Though not the main issue, if exploited, it could lead to arbitrary code execution in a user's browser.
*   **Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** According to the provided CVSS score, the impact on these three aspects is partial.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests, where the `myevent_path` parameter is supplied with a malicious URL in the query string.
    *   Specifically, the `event.php` and `initialize.php` files are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   The attacker needs to have a webserver where they can host the malicious files to be included.

**Additional Details:**
*   The MyEvent script version 1.2 is mentioned as the vulnerable software.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" risk with a CVSS Base Score of 7.5/10.

**In summary:** This is a critical Remote File Inclusion vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution, allowing an attacker to completely compromise a vulnerable server.
