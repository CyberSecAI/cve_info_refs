Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-7247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection found in the "Weblinks" component of Joomla! versions up to 1.0.9. Specifically, the `title` parameter of the web link submission form is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `title` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. It's a "blind" injection because the attacker doesn't directly see the results of the query; instead, they must use techniques like timing attacks to infer information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including admin usernames and password hashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining admin credentials, the attacker can gain full control of the vulnerable Joomla! website.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, SQL injection could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution, depending on database and application configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `index.php` page with the `option=com_weblinks` parameter.
*   **Malicious SQL in 'title' Parameter:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `title` parameter of the request. The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement combined with a timing function `benchmark()` to infer information through response times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! website.
*   **Joomla Login Credentials:** The provided exploit requires valid Joomla! user credentials to initially login and obtain a valid cookie to be used for subsequent requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit provided uses a timing-based blind SQL injection technique. By using a `benchmark()` function and observing the response time, the attacker can determine if a condition in the injected SQL query is true or false.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited even if the web link submission fails, as the injection occurs before the submission is processed.
*   The provided exploit code extracts the admin username and password hash character by character using the timing based attack and displays it.
