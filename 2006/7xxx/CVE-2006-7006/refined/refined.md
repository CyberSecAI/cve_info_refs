- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The reported Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in `team.php` of the Somery application, which is claimed to be triggered via the `checkauth` parameter, is disputed. The analysis of the source code reveals that the `$checkauth` variable is only used within conditional statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a *claimed* Remote File Inclusion vulnerability via the `checkauth` parameter, however, the provided source code analysis suggests that this is not a legitimate vulnerability because the parameter is used only within conditional statements and cannot directly influence the `include` statement to load a remote file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The *claimed* impact was the ability to include a remote file by setting the `checkauth` parameter to a URL, which would result in the execution of attacker-controlled code on the server. However, the analysis disputes this impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The *claimed* attack vector was via an HTTP GET request to `team.php` with the `checkauth` parameter set to a malicious URL. The provided information disputes this vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker is claimed to require the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and set the `checkauth` parameter. However, the analysis disputes the exploitability of this vector, as the parameter is only used within conditional statements.
