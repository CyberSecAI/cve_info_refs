      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7069",
      "description": "Socketwiz Bookmarks 2.0 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion via the 'root_dir' parameter in smarty_config.php.",
       "root_cause": "The application improperly handles user-supplied input in the 'root_dir' parameter within the 'smarty_config.php' file. It allows remote file inclusion by using this parameter to include external files.",

        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable system, including potential data theft or denial of service.",
