The provided content relates to two separate CVEs, **CVE-2008-2383** and **CVE-2006-7236**, however, there is no official description for CVE-2006-7236, and the content is referencing Bug ID #384593, which is associated with CVE-2006-7236. Therefore, it's necessary to analyze the content for both CVEs individually:

**CVE-2008-2383**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `DECRQSS` (Device Control Request Status String) sequence in xterm. Specifically, when an invalid command is received within this sequence, xterm echoes the invalid command.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection. The vulnerability allows arbitrary commands to be executed via a specially crafted `DECRQSS` sequence.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system by sending a malicious `DECRQSS` sequence to a user's xterm. This could lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector includes sending the malicious `DECRQSS` sequence through an email message or via a log file viewed by a user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send a specifically crafted sequence to a user's terminal, either directly or indirectly through a medium like email or logs.

**CVE-2006-7236**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to the `allowWindowOps` feature in xterm, specifically the window title reporting (CSI 21t) combined with the ability to set the window title using OSC 0/1/2 escape sequences. This allows an attacker to craft a window title containing malicious commands. When the user's shell requests the window title using CSI 21t it returns the attacker-crafted title which can be then interpreted as a shell command.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection. The vulnerability occurs because `xterm` does not properly sanitize the window title, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the user's system when the window title is retrieved via CSI 21t.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious window title embedded into a text file, email or other text-based communication that is viewed within the terminal.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted text to the user's terminal session.

The provided text also includes details on the fixes for both vulnerabilities. For **CVE-2008-2383**, the fix involved making `xterm` respond to incorrectly formatted `DECRQSS` sequences with a cancel and for **CVE-2006-7236**, the fix involved disabling `allowWindowOps` by default. Both vulnerabilities were also addressed by setting default values for `allowFontOps` and `allowWindowOps` to `false`.
