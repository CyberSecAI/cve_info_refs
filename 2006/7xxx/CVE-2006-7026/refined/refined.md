- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to an insecure handling of the `path` parameter in the `join.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by including a remote file, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request to `/sources/join.php` with a crafted `CONFIG[path]` parameter containing a URL to a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
