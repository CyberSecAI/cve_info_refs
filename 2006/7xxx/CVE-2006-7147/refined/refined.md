- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `phpbb_root_path` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in include statements within the `functions_mod_user.php` file. This allows an attacker to control the path used in the `include_once` calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP request by manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and requires no special privileges. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable script and have access to a file server with malicious code.
