### Bug Description

After upgrading to kernel 2.6.15-27.48, which includes version 1.5 of the skge driver, we experienced network related lockups on some of our machines, beginning with some "badness" warnings, followed by "scheduling while atomic" errors and finally a system crash (no response to pings, local console dead). We finally found that the skge gigabit ethernet driver was the cause. A comparison between the 1.5 version included in 2.6.15-27.48 in dapper/security and the 1.5 version in vanilla 2.6.17 (where it is supposed to be taken from) showed that the dapper version contains additional calls to spin\_unlock for the hw\_lock of the skge device (and \*no\* spin\_lock calls for hw\_lock at all!), whereas the 2.6.17 vanilla version seems to have eliminated hw\_lock completely. I therefore think that something went wrong when "transplanting" version 1.5 to 2.6.15-27.48, and the removal of hw\_lock was not done in all places.

To verify this analysis, we are currently running a skge.ko module compiled from a modified source where we eliminated hw\_lock and all calls to spin\_\* corresponding to this lock (basically the 2.6.17 version of the driver, but with the pci\_device\_id patches from dapper). We have not yet seen lock-ups from this modified driver.

Why does the lockup occur only on a subset of our machines? A quick glance at the 1.5 code in dapper shows another locking-related coding error: The spin\_unlock is only called in the second branch of the interrupt service routine skge\_intr that seems to handle transmission errors, while the main branch, handling data I/O, seems to be correct. Therefore, the error becomes visible only when the bad branch in the ISR is executed, which seems to depend on the cabling to the machine and the network load (and fortunately our server machines have better cabling and were therefore unaffected by this bug!).

So, when verifying this bug report, don't be surprised if you can't reproduce it in many configurations, but just have a look at the source and compare it to the version in 2.6.17. The difference (and the fact that the locking in 2.6.15-27.48 is broken) is obvious. \*So\* obvious in fact that I really wonder how this defective driver made its way into dapper security... (not asking the question whether it is really necessary to deliver not security-related (and obviously not thoroughly tested) driver updates in a security update to a LTS version targeted at server use at all!)

I just verified that this defect in the skge driver is also present in the current git tree (URL given below) for edgy. It would be fine if it could be fixed in time, as releasing edgy with this bug would prevent installation of edgy on affected machines (without special workarounds), as accessing the network would lead to instability of the kernel due to wrong preempt\_count value.

As there seems to be no activity on this bug yet, I did a binary search in the bcollins/ubuntu-edgy git tree to find the problematic commit that introduced the problem. (I use the http interface on git.kernel.org to do this.)

The situation is quite confusing. There are two files named skge.c in the kernel, one belonging to the skge driver, the other to the sk98lin driver, and it seems that these two files were confused when doing feature backports. This occurs in commit df5831f36218ca9276866ad26524492810cf3d53 from 2006-05-09 and is corrected by commit 37419595bb1bc44c489daa1d101a0e633bf3b934 from 2006-05-11. Before these commits, there is no hw\_lock present in the skge driver; the correction commit reintroduces it, but obviously consistently, reverting skge.c from version 1.5 to 1.3 again. The following commit, 2d2a387199bf38c6628adb9c6184d7ab6e306148 from 2006-05-20, eliminates hw\_lock again, and the driver version is now 1.5 (and does not contain the locking error).

Then, on 2006-08-10 in commit c168e0350ac2d286724ea985227360e9605eb9c3, the error seems to be introduced. Here it gets interesting, as the diff for skge.c in this commit does not match the state of the skge.c file. It (the diff) indicates that the line "spin\_unlock(&hw->hw\_lock);" causing the error is present in the file both before and after the patch (black color in the http interface, no + or - prefix in the diff), while this line is clearly \*not\* in the skge.c file before this commit. (However, it was present in the 1.3 branch that we temporarily reverted back to as described above.) Git (or, more precisely, patch) seems to get confused and introduces this line into the file, causing the error we are seeing here.

For me, the problem seems to be caused by a commit based on a previous skge.c version (1.3?) instead of the version that was in the git tree at that time (1.5), causing patch to malfunction and introduce the spin\_unlock line into the code. As my previous reports said, a comparison with skge 1.5 in vanilla 2.6.17 shows no other significant differences, and an application of the patch I submitted above should be sufficient to correct the situation.

I can confirm this bug still exists in Dapper kernel 2.6.15-28.

We have three almost identical computers at the office, each having an Asus P4P800-SE motherboard and running Dapper. All three computers are connected to a gigabit switch. All three have had stability issues with networking especially after the switch was upgraded from 100Mbps to 1000Mbps. The computers tend to crash whenever something network-intensive is being done, such as downloading an .iso image from another computer on the LAN. On at least one computer, running a distcc build causes a crash within ten seconds \_every time\_.

The patch above seems to fix all the stability issues.

I can confirm that this bug exists in Dapper since version 2.6.15-26.47. The changelog states that skge was then updated to version in 2.6.17, to obtain fixes and D-Link DGE-530T support.

I was able to reproduce the bug on two identical computers (ASUS A8V Deluxe Mainboard, with a Marvell 88E8001 Gigabit Ethernet Controller onboard), attached to a Gigabit-Network.

I can also confirm that Alexander's Patch above fixes the issue with no ill effects so far.

Can anyone confirm the fault still happens when using Gutsy (2.6.22) ? I've attached a patch for Gutsy to testing.

Although the drivers/net/skge.c and drivers/net/skge.h source has changed somewhat they still use

drivers/net/skge.h::struct skge\_hw {

 void \_\_iomem \*regs;

 struct pci\_dev \*pdev;

 spinlock\_t hw\_lock;

....

drivers/net/skge.c::static int \_\_devinit skge\_probe(struct pci\_dev \*pdev,

    const struct pci\_device\_id \*ent)

{

 struct net\_device \*dev, \*dev1;

 struct skge\_hw \*hw;

...

spin\_lock\_init(&hw->hw\_lock);

I have been using Gutsy for about two weeks now on one of the machines that were affected by this bug under Dapper (This is a fresh, parallel installation, no dist-upgrade). I haven't experienced any problems so far, so it seems that this bug does not exist in Gutsy. My kernel version is 2.6.22-14-generic.

Hm, I'm not sure how, but the ubuntu-security team wasn't subscribed to this bug (yet it was flagged as security). The fix for this should be available in the next kernel update for Dapper. Thanks for tracking down the cause and building a patch. :)

eh... i'm not sure if this is the same bug or related but i am getting an error with the skge.c file that locks up my computer. the strange thing is that it doesn't always happen, it seems only to lock-up on random.

I've attached the part of the dmesg log that has the problem

It would be best to open a new bug. The issues in this bug have been

addressed, so new problems shouldn't be confused with it. (Especially

since it is considered to be "closed".)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

Alexander Schulze discovered that the skge driver does not properly

use the spin\_lock and spin\_unlock functions. Remote attackers could

exploit this by sending a flood of network traffic and cause a denial

of service (crash). ([CVE-2006-7229](/security/CVE-2006-7229))

Hugh Dickins discovered that hugetlbfs performed certain prio\_tree

calculations using HPAGE\_SIZE instead of PAGE\_SIZE. A local user

could exploit this and cause a denial of service via kernel panic.

([CVE-2007-4133](/security/CVE-2007-4133))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. ([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges

on directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
