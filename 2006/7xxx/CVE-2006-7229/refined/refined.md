{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The skge driver in Linux kernel 2.6.15-27.48 contains additional calls to spin_unlock for the hw_lock of the skge device without corresponding spin_lock calls. This was introduced by a faulty patch application during a backport from a later kernel version which confused the skge driver with the sk98lin driver, resulting in a spin_unlock being added to the code where it should not have been.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of spin_lock and spin_unlock functions in the skge driver.",
      "Inconsistent locking in the interrupt service routine (ISR) of the skge driver, where the spin_unlock was only called in the transmission error branch, not the data I/O branch."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this by sending a flood of network traffic causing a denial of service (system crash). The system would become unresponsive to pings and the local console would become dead.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a flood of network traffic to the affected machine.",
      "Triggering the transmission error branch of the skge driver's interrupt service routine (ISR)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected machine. This can be done remotely if the machine is exposed to the network."
  },
  "additional_notes": [
    "The issue was introduced when backporting the skge driver from 2.6.17 to 2.6.15-27.48.",
    "The problematic commit introduced an incorrect spin_unlock call that didn't match the intended state of the code.",
     "The bug was triggered by a confusion between two files named skge.c, which led to an incorrect patch application.",
     "The issue was present in multiple Ubuntu releases using kernel 2.6.15, including Dapper and Edgy (at some point of its development), but not in Gutsy (2.6.22) or later releases.",
     "The issue was fixed in Ubuntu kernel 2.6.15-51.66 (USN-578-1)."
