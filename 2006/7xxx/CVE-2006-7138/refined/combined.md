Depending of the APEX application it is possible to inject custom SQL statements. The entire SQL statement is accessible from the URL in the parameter P\_LOV. To protect the SELECT statement in the URL Oracle is using a MD5 checksum. By modifying the SQL statement and recalculating the MD5 checksum P\_LOV\_CHECKSUM it is possible to run custom SQL statements from the URL.   Sample URL http://apex:7777/pls/htmldb/wwv\_flow\_utilities.gen\_popup\_list?p\_filterme=p\_t02&p\_element\_index=1&p\_hidden\_elem\_name=p\_t01&p\_form\_index=0&p\_max\_elements=&p\_escape\_html=&p\_ok\_to\_query=YES&p\_flow\_id=100&p\_page\_id=11&p\_session\_id=15108399238201864297&p\_eval\_value=&p\_return\_key=YES&p\_translation=N&p\_lov=select%20cust\_last\_name%20||%20'%2C%20'%20||%20cust\_first\_name%20d%2C%20customer\_id%20r%20from%20demo\_customers%20order%20by%20cust\_last\_name&p\_lov\_checksum=82C7EFB6FA3A2FA2C6E1A70FB63BB064   Affected Products This bug is fixed with 2.2 of APEX which is not part of the Critical Patch Update October 2006. It's necessary to upgrade your APEX/HTMLDB installation to 2.2 or better 2.2.1.. Keep in mind that APEX 2.2 is NOT running on Oracle Application Express. Patches are currently not available for Oracle Application Express.   Patch Information This bug is fixed with Apex 2.2 or higher.

Additional information will be added soon.   With this CPU Oracle has fixed 101 security bugs in various products and components:   The Oracle database patches are fixing 10 Oracle Spatial, 6 Change Data Capture, 3 XMLDB, 2 Database Core and 1 database Scheduler.   Oracle fixed some really old cross site scripting bugs in Oracle Reports. Finally Oracle fixed these reports vulnerbilities after 1056 (!!!) days. It seems that Oracle is now fixing also old bugs.   The analysis of the 35 APEX/HTMLDB security vulnerabilities shows that most of the vulnerabilities were already fixed with earlier versions (e.g. 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2). The Upgrade to 2.2.1 contains only a few security fixes (see section APEX in this analysis).   | Database | 22 | | --- | --- | | OHS | 8 | | APEX | 35 | | OAS | 14 | | OCS | 12 | | APPS | 21 | | OPA |

It seems that most of the 35 security bugs were already fixed with older versions of HTMLDB/APEX. Especially if your are using an older version (< 2.1) of APEX/HTMLDB it is highly recommended to upgrade to 2.2.1.
