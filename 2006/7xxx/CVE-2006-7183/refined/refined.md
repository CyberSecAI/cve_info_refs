- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `styles.php` script in Exhibit Engine version 1.22 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This is due to the `toroot` parameter not being properly sanitized allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server by exploiting the RFI vulnerability. This can lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `styles.php` script, including a malicious URL in the `toroot` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to control a server hosting the malicious payload.
