        "details": "The content describes a bug in PCRE2 related to integer overflows when processing a large number of named subpatterns or long subpattern names. The vulnerability is located in the `pcre_compile` function where the size of the data block is calculated and requested using `pcre_malloc`, which can lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n**Root Cause:** Integer overflow in calculation of memory allocation size during regular expression compilation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**  Integer overflow vulnerability leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by processing an excessive number of subpatterns or very long subpattern names.\n\n**Impact:** Potential arbitrary code execution if crafted regular expressions are processed by vulnerable versions.\n\n**Attack Vectors:** Exploitable via malformed regular expressions containing a large number of named subpatterns or very long subpattern names.\n\n**Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers need to be able to provide the crafted regular expression to a vulnerable application using the PCRE library."

        "details": "The content describes an integer overflow vulnerability in PCRE's `pcre_compile` function, specifically in how it handles named subpatterns. It highlights that a malicious regex with many named subpatterns and long names can cause the size calculation to overflow, leading to a buffer overflow when memory is allocated using `pcre_malloc`.\n\n**Root cause:** Integer overflow during calculation of required buffer size for compiled regular expression.\n\n**Weaknesses:** Integer overflow and buffer overflow when processing named capturing groups.\n\n**Impact:** A crash (Denial of Service) or, potentially, execution of arbitrary code. This could lead to compromise of applications using PCRE.\n\n**Attack Vector:** Malicious regex patterns that contain a large number of named subpatterns or long subpattern names.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be able to control the regex patterns that are processed by an application using the PCRE library."
