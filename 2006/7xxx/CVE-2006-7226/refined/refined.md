It states that there is a miscalculation of memory requirements for repeated subpattern containing a named recursion or subroutine reference. The vulnerability could lead to \"Failed: internal error: code overflow\" or \"glibc detected double free or corruption\" errors. The report includes a patch against pcre 6.4 provided by Ludwig Nussel of SUSE. The vulnerability has a high severity and priority. The affected component is identified as vulnerability under Security Response product."

This vulnerability is related to \"multiple security issues\". The announcement states that on SLES9 the included library was patched. SLES10/10.1 now uses the system pcre library. 10.2 and 10.3 already used the system pcre library before."

This can lead to a crash, arbitrary code execution and potentially privilege escalation. Patches and upgrades are mentioned as the solution." ,
    "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a miscalculation in the PCRE library when dealing with repeated subpatterns containing named recursion or subroutine references. This leads to an incorrect calculation of required memory for the compiled pattern.",

          "Memory miscalculation",
          "Potential buffer overflow",
          "Possible arbitrary code execution",
           "Potential privilege escalation"

        "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (crash), or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user of an application linked against PCRE leading to privilege escalation in some cases.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted regular expression to an application using a vulnerable version of PCRE.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed regular expression to a vulnerable application utilizing PCRE."
