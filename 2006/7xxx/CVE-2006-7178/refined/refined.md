    "summary": "The MadWifi driver does not properly process Channel Switch Announcement Information Elements, allowing for an abnormal channel change. The ieee80211_input() function does not properly handle AUTH frames. A remote attacker could send a Channel Switch Count less than or equal to one to trigger a channel change, resulting in a communication loss and a Denial of Service. A remote attacker could send specially crafted AUTH frames to the vulnerable host, resulting in a Denial of Service by crashing the kernel.",
