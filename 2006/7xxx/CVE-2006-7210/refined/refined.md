    "vulnerability": "Denial of Service",
    "description": "A specially crafted PNG file with a malformed IHDR block can cause a denial of service on Microsoft Windows systems. The vulnerability is triggered when the system attempts to process this malicious image, leading to a 100% CPU usage until the explorer.exe process is terminated.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Windows handles the processing of the IHDR block within a PNG file. A malformed IHDR chunk causes the system to enter an infinite loop or a very long processing operation, leading to high CPU consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed PNG headers"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service on affected Windows systems, making the system unresponsive and requiring termination of the explorer.exe process to recover.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted PNG files"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted PNG file and then induce a user to open or process the file with a vulnerable application (e.g., through web browsing or file system exploration in Windows Explorer)."
