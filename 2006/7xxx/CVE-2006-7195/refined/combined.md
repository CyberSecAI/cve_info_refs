tomcat security update (RHSA-2007-0326)

Original Release Date: May 31, 2007

Last Revised: June 22, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-206

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Apache Tomcat is a servlet container which powers various Java-based web tools.

A number of vulnerabilities have been reported in tomcat.

A vulnerability in the way tomcat accepts content-length headers could
allow an attacker to poison a web-cache, bypass a web firewall, or conduct
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2005-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2090) to this issue.

In some proxy configurations, a crafted HTTP request could be sent to view
non-proxied content. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450) to this issue.

Several JSP examples display unfiltered values, which could allow a remote
hacker to perform XSS attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2006-7195](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7195) and
[CVE-2006-7196](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7196) to these issues.

The default Tomcat configuration permits using insecure SSL cipher suites,
including the anonymous cipher suite.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-1858](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1858) to this issue.

Directory listings are enabled by default in Tomcat. In instances where
the web server administrator has not disabled directory listings, all unprotected
information in the document root is viewable.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2006-3835](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3835) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0326.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with tomcat installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya AES | All | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2.2. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use vulnerable versions of
tomcat, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected package.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Apache Tomcat 5.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 5.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 5.0.x and 5.5.x are no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 5.0.x and 5.5.x branches will not be
fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.
Vulnerabilities fixed in Tomcat 5.5.26 onwards have not been assessed to
determine if they are present in the 5.0.x branch.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 5.5 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-5.5-doc/building.html)
in documentation (`webapps/tomcat-docs` subdirectory of
a binary distributive) and `BUILDING.txt` file in a source
distributive.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### released 10 Oct 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.36

**Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness**
[CVE-2012-3439](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3439)

Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:

1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.

These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1392248](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1392248).

The first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team
on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the
Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues
were made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.35

### released 16 Jan 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.35

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-0022](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022)

Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated
inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of
parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an
attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU
to be used which in turn could create a denial of service. The issue was
addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code to efficiently
process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.

This was fixed in revisions [1221282](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1221282),
[1224640](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1224640) and
[1228191](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1228191).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 21 October 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.34

### released 22 Sep 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.34

**Moderate: Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST authentication**
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184)

Note: Mitre elected to break this issue down into multiple issues and
have allocated the following additional references to parts of this
issue:
[CVE-2011-5062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5062),
[CVE-2011-5063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5063) and
[CVE-2011-5064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5064). The Apache Tomcat security team will
continue to treat this as a single issue using the reference
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184).

The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to have
several weaknesses:

* replay attacks were permitted
* server nonces were not checked
* client nonce counts were not checked
* qop values were not checked
* realm values were not checked
* the server secret was hard-coded to a known string

The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only as
secure as BASIC authentication.

This was fixed in [revision 1159309](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1159309).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 16 March 2011 and
made public on 26 September 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2204)

When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml) and
creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may
trigger an error message in the JMX client that includes the user's
password. This error message is also written to the Tomcat logs. User
passwords are visible to administrators with JMX access and/or
administrators with read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that
do not have these permissions but are able to read log files may be able
to discover a user's password.

This was fixed in [revision 1140072](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1140072).

This was identified by Polina Genova on 14 June 2011 and
made public on 27 June 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2526)

Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP APR
connector. sendfile is used automatically for content served via the
DefaultServlet and deployed web applications may use it directly via
setting request attributes. These request attributes were not validated.
When running under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed a
malicious web application to do one or more of the following that would
normally be prevented by a security manager:

* return files to users that the security manager should make
  inaccessible
* terminate (via a crash) the JVM

Additionally, these vulnerabilities only occur when all of the following

[CVE-2011-2729](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2729)

Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc (the service wrapper for
Linux that is part of the Commons Daemon project) does not drop
capabilities allowing the application to access files and directories
owned by superuser. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* Tomcat is running on a Linux operating system
* jsvc was compiled with libcap
* -user parameter is used

Affected Tomcat versions shipped with source files for jsvc that included
this vulnerability.

This was fixed in [revision 1159346](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1159346).

This was identified by Wilfried Weissmann on 20 July 2011 and made public
on 12 August 2011.

Affects: 5.5.32-5.5.33

**Important: Authentication bypass and information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3190](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3190)

Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse
proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the
reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a
request includes a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to
Tomcat that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the request
body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not process this message as a
request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have
full control over the AJP message permitting authentication bypass and
information disclosure. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* The org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is not used
* POST requests are accepted
* The request body is not processed

This was fixed in [revision 1162960](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162960).

This was reported publicly on 20th August 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

Mitigation options:

* Upgrade to Tomcat 5.5.34.
* Apply the appropriate [patch](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162960).
* Configure both Tomcat and the reverse proxy to use a shared secret.

  (It is "`request.secret`" attribute in AJP <Connector>,
  "`worker.workername.secret`" directive for mod\_jk.
  The mod\_proxy\_ajp module currently does not support shared secrets).
* Use the org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler (BIO) AJP connector
  implementation.

  (It is automatically selected if you do not have Tomcat-Native library
  installed. It can be also selected explicitly:
  `<Connector protocol="org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler">`).

**Low: SecurityManager file permission bypass**
[CVE-2010-3718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3718)

When running under a SecurityManager, access to the file system is
limited but web applications are granted read/write permissions to the
work directory. This directory is used for a variety of temporary files
such as the intermediate files generated when compiling JSPs to Servlets.
The location of the work directory is specified by a ServletContect
attribute that is meant to be read-only to web applications. However,
due to a coding error, the read-only setting was not applied. Therefore,
a malicious web application may modify the attribute before Tomcat
applies the file permissions. This can be used to grant read/write
permissions to any area on the file system which a malicious web
application may then take advantage of. This vulnerability is only
applicable when hosting web applications from untrusted sources such as
shared hosting environments.

This was fixed in [revision 1027610](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1027610).

This was discovered by the Tomcat security team on 12 Oct 2010 and

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
Vulnerability**
[CVE-2010-2227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227)

Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header were
found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote attacker could
trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent requests to fail and/or
information to leak between requests. This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is
behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should
reject the invalid transfer encoding header.

This was fixed in [revision 959428](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=959428).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 14 Jun 2010 and

**Low: Information disclosure in authentication headers**
[CVE-2010-1157](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1157)

The `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST
authentication includes a realm name. If a
`<realm-name>` element is specified for the application
in web.xml it will be used. However, a `<realm-name>`
is not specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code
snippet `request.getServerName() + ":" +
request.getServerPort()`. In some circumstances this can expose
the local host name or IP address of the machine running Tomcat.

This was fixed in [revision 936541](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=936541).

[CVE-2009-2693](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2693)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR files were not checked for directory
traversal attempts. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary content
outside of the web root by including entries such as
`../../bin/catalina.sh` in the WAR.

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

**Low: Insecure partial deploy after failed undeploy**
[CVE-2009-2901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2901)

By default, Tomcat automatically deploys any directories placed in a
host's appBase. This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute
of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy, the remaining
files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process.
Depending on circumstances, files normally protected by one or more
security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints,
making them accessible without authentication. This issue only affects
Windows platforms

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and

**Low: Unexpected file deletion in work directory**
[CVE-2009-2902](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2902)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR file names were not checked for
directory traversal attempts. For example, deploying and undeploying
`...war` allows an attacker to cause the deletion of the
current contents of the host's work directory which may cause problems
for currently running applications.

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in revisions [782757](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=782757) and

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

The fix for this issue was insufficient. A fix was also required in the
JK connector module for httpd. See [CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860) for further
information.

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is used
behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server with
mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP request
containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work around the context
restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both options
default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`: `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`: `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat as
they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no proxy
restricting context access was used.

the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.15

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.13, 5.0.SVN

**Low: Directory listing**
[CVE-2006-3835](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3835)

This is expected behaviour when directory listings are enabled. The
semicolon (;) is the separator for path parameters so inserting one
before a file name changes the request into a request for a directory
with a path parameter. If directory listings are enabled, a directory
listing will be shown. In response to this and other directory listing
issues, directory listings were changed to be disabled by default.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.12

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2005-3510](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3510)

The root cause is the relatively expensive calls required to generate
the content for the directory listings. If directory listings are
enabled, the number of files in each directory should be kept to a
minimum. In response to this issue, directory listings were changed to
be disabled by default. Additionally, a
[patch](http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=113356822719767&w=2) has been proposed that would improve performance, particularly
for large directories, by caching directory listings.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.12

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.7, 5.0.SVN

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2005-4838](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4838)

Various JSPs included as part of the JSP examples and the Tomcat Manager
are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack as they do not escape
user provided data before including it in the returned page.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.6

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.1

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-3271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3271)

[Bug 25835](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25835) can, in rare circumstances - this has only been reproduced
using a debugger to force a particular processing sequence for two threads -
allow a user from a non-permitted IP address to gain access to a context
that is protected with a valve that extends RequestFilterValve. This includes
the standard RemoteAddrValve and RemoteHostValve implementations.

Affects: 5.5.0 (5.0.x unknown)

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2010-4476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476)

A JVM bug could cause Double conversion to hang JVM when accessing to a
form based security constrained page or any page that calls
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocale() or
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocales(). A specially crafted request
can be used to trigger a denial of service.

A work-around for this JVM bug was provided in
[revision 1066318](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066318).
This work-around is included in Tomcat 5.5.33 onwards.

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 01 Feb 2011 and
made public on 31 Jan 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.32

**Moderate: TLS SSL Man In The Middle**
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)

A vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that allows an attacker to
inject arbitrary requests into an TLS stream during renegotiation.

The TLS implementation used by Tomcat varies with connector. The blocking
IO (BIO) and non-blocking (NIO) connectors use the JSSE implementation
provided by the JVM. The APR/native connector uses OpenSSL.

The BIO connector is vulnerable if the JSSE version used is vulnerable.
To workaround this until a fix is available in JSSE, a new connector
attribute `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation` has been added to
the BIO connector. It should be set to `false` (the default)
to protect against this vulnerability.

The NIO connector is not vulnerable as it does not support
renegotiation.

The APR/native workarounds are detailed on the
[APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

Users should be aware that the impact of disabling renegotiation will
vary with both application and client. In some circumstances disabling
renegotiation may result in some clients being unable to access the
application.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 904851](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=904851)
that provided the new `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`
attribute. This work around is included in Tomcat 5.5.29 onwards.

Support for the new TLS renegotiation protocol (RFC 5746) that does not
have this security issue:

* For connectors using JSSE implementation provided by JVM:
  Added in Tomcat 5.5.33.

  Requires JRE that supports RFC 5746. For Oracle JRE that is
  [known](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/tlsreadme2-176330.html)
  to be 6u22 or later.
* For connectors using APR and OpenSSL:

  TBD. See
  [APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 681029](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=681029)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 5.5.27 onwards.

**JavaMail information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-1754](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1754)

The vulnerability described is in the web application deployed on Tomcat
rather than in Tomcat.

**JavaMail information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-1753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1753)

The vulnerability described is in the web application deployed on Tomcat
rather than in Tomcat.
