======================================================================
1) Affected Software
BSQ Sitestats (component for Joomla) 1.x
NOTE: Other versions may also be affected.
======================================================================
2) Severity
Rating: Highly critical
Impact: System access
Manipulation of data
Cross Site Scripting
Where: From remote
======================================================================
3) Vendor's Description of Software
"BSQ Sitestats is a site stats module that is lightweight on the front
end but offers both tabular and graphical summaries of site visitors'
sessions on the backend".
Product Link:
http://developer.joomla.org/sf/projects/bsq\_sitestats
======================================================================
4) Description of Vulnerability
Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in the BSQ
Sitestats component for Joomla, which can be exploited by malicious
people to conduct cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks, and
to compromise a vulnerable system.
1) Input passed to the "ip" form field parameter when performing an IP
Address Lookup is not properly sanitised before being returned to the
user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code
in a logged in administrator's browser session in context of an
affected site.
2) Input passed to multiple parameters when importing the
ip-to-country.csv file is not properly sanitised before being used in a
SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code when an administrator is tricked into importing a
malicious ip-to-country.csv file.
3) Input passed via the "HTTP Referer", the "HTTP User Agent", and the
"HTTP Accept Language" Header bsqtemplateinc.php is not properly
sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to
manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
Successful exploitation requires that "magic\_quotes\_gpc" is disabled.
4) Input passed to the "baseDir" parameter in
components/com\_bsq\_sitestats/external/rssfeeds.php is not properly
verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to
execute arbitrary PHP code by including files from local or external
resources.
Successful exploitation requires that "register\_globals" is enabled.
The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.8.0. Other
versions may also be affected.
======================================================================
5) Solution
The vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 2.2.1.
======================================================================
6) Time Table
14/09/2006 - Vendor notified.
14/09/2006 - Vendor response.
17/09/2006 - Vendor releases fixed version 2.2.1.
29/09/2006 - Public disclosure.
======================================================================
7) Credits
Discovered by Sven Krewitt, Secunia Research.
======================================================================
8) References
None assigned.
======================================================================
