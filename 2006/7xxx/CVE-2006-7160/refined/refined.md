{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient argument validation in Outpost Firewall PRO's hooked SSDT functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Outpost Firewall PRO driver, Sandbox.sys, hooks several functions in the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) but fails to validate arguments passed from user mode.",
       "Specifically, insufficient validation occurs in at least twelve cases where arguments for system calls are not properly checked leading to errors.",
       "The issue is present in functions like NtAssignProcessToJobObject, NtCreateKey, NtCreateThread, NtDeleteFile, NtLoadDriver, NtOpenProcess, NtProtectVirtualMemory, NtReplaceKey, NtTerminateProcess, NtTerminateThread, NtUnloadDriver and NtWriteVirtualMemory."
    ],
    "impact": "System crashes due to errors in the Outpost driver (Sandbox.sys) when invalid arguments are passed to hooked SSDT functions. In the case of NtWriteVirtualMemory, the user is alerted about a potentially dangerous action and can block it, however, the underlying implementation is still considered improper.",
    "attack_vectors": "User-mode applications calling the vulnerable SSDT functions with invalid arguments.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run code in user mode on the affected system to pass invalid arguments to the vulnerable SSDT functions. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 (971.584.079)",
    "Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 (964.582.059)",
    "Older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0",
    "Possibly older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO"
  ],
    "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7160"
