{
  "CVE-2006-7094": {
    "Description": "The net-ftp/ftpd package in Gentoo and Debian distributions incorrectly uses geteuid() instead of getegid() in a patch, leading to /bin/ls being executed with gid 0 privileges. This allows clients to list private directories in some filesystem configurations.",
    "Root cause": "An incorrect patch introduced a vulnerability due to the use of geteuid() instead of getegid() when setting the group ID before executing /bin/ls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege assignment"
    ],
    "Impact": "Clients of the ftpd can list private directories in certain filesystem configurations, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote clients of the ftpd server can exploit this vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a client of the vulnerable ftpd server, including anonymous users."
