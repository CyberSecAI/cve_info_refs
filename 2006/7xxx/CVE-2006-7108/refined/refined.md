{
  "CVE-2006-7108": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw was found in the way the login process handled logins which did not require authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": "The login process was not enforcing access policies (like account management checks and password expiration checks) when authentication was skipped, for example, due to Kerberos tickets.",
    "Impact": "A remote user could bypass intended access policies which would normally be enforced by the login process. This could allow unauthorized access to the system, even if the user's account should have been disabled or password expired.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs a way to authenticate without a password, for example, via Kerberos tickets.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs because the `pam_acct_mgmt` and `pam_chauthtok` modules were skipped when authentication was skipped, which leads to the access policies normally enforced by those modules not being applied. This was fixed by ensuring those PAM modules are run even if no password authentication is required."
