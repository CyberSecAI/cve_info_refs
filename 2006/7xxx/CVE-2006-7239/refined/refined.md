Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2006-7239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a `strcmp()` call on a potentially NULL value within the certificate verification logic in `gnutls_algorithms.c`. This occurs in the `_gnutls_x509_oid2mac_algorithm` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code was not checking if `p->oid` was NULL before calling `strcmp(oid, p->oid)`. When a specific combination of local CA certificates and peer-sent certificates was used, it could lead to a NULL pointer dereference when `p->oid` is NULL, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash in GnuTLS clients. This crash can occur during the certificate verification process.
- **Remote Trigger (Potentially):** While the initial report suggested a specific local CA certificate was needed to trigger the crash, the security advisory mentions that it *might* be possible to trigger this remotely using a specially crafted server certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side:** An attacker could potentially exploit this by crafting a malicious server certificate and presenting it to a vulnerable GnuTLS client during a TLS handshake.
- **Server-Side:** A vulnerable GnuTLS server could be forced to use a problematic certificate, crashing if it were also acting as a client to another server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a TLS connection with a vulnerable GnuTLS client or be in control of certificates used by the GnuTLS client.
- For remote exploitation, an attacker would need to control a server and provide a crafted certificate during the TLS handshake.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in GnuTLS 1.4.2. The patch adds a NULL check before the `strcmp` call.
