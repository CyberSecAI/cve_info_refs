* **About Security Advisories**

  Although, the core GnuTLS team does not have resources to
  analyse the background and impact of security issues in depth,
  we do take security seriously. All known information on security incidents
  is collected and published in this page.

  Our idea is to turn writing security advisory into an open
  process where everyone can contribute. Everyone is invited to
  analyse the impact of discovered bugs, and, of course, also to
  study the code for new bugs.

  All serious analysis of bugs will be posted on this page.

  If this level of support is inadequate for your needs,
  [customized commercial support](commercial.html) is
  available.* **Reporting security problems**

    Send non-public reports to [the maintainers](contrib.html). All
    other reports should be sent to [one of the
    mailing lists](lists.html).* **Advisories**

      | GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 ["CRIME" attack](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/) [CVE-2012-4929](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4929) | Possible plaintext recovery | There is an attack on TLS called "CRIME" which takes advantage of compression and may recover plaintext under certain circumstances.  **Who is affected by this attack?** + Clients or servers that use compression and provide the ability to   an adversary to inject data (multiple times) in their session.  **How to mitigate the attack?** + Do not enable compression (GnuTLS doesn't enable it by default) + When using compression use the CBC ciphers that include a random   padding up to 255 bytes. That would increase the number of trials an   attacker needs to perform significantly. Note that using compression provides [information to an attacker](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/ecrypt/provpriv2012/abstracts/barghavan.pdf) on the plaintext.

```
I am happy to announce GnuTLS 1.4.2, a bugfix release on the stable
1.4 branch.  This version is what we recommend for those who need a
stable version of GnuTLS.

GnuTLS is a modern C library that implement the standard network
security protocol Transport Layer Security (TLS), for use by network
applications.

Noteworthy changes since 1.4.1:

** Fix a crash (strcmp() on a NULL value) in the certificate verification logic.
This can happen if you call gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2 and have
a certain mix of local CA certificates and the peer send special
certificates, that together trigger certain behaviour.  It is not
known at this point whether the crash can be triggered without the
special local CA certificate, and thus turn this into a remote crash
of clients that verify server certificates when they talk to a server
with the special server certificate.  See GNUTLS-SA-2006-2 on
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html> for more up to date
information.  Reported by satyakumar <[satyam_kkd at hyd.hellosoft.com](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>.

** Change SRP and Cert-Type extensions to match IANA registry.

** OpenCDK updated to 0.5.9 to fix some problems with OpenPGP support.

** Make --without-included-libtasn1 work.
Reported by Daniel Black <[dragonheart at gentoo.org](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnutls-dev)>.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

Improving GnuTLS is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find GnuTLS useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software, or donate
money or equipment.

Commercial support contracts for GnuTLS are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding GnuTLS
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See <http://josefsson.org/> for more details.

With some guess-work, I was able to reproduce the problem, and the
patch is below.  I'm not yet sure what it is that trigger the problem.
If I replace the server key/certificate with another pair, it doesn't
crash, and if I instead replace the CA certificate with another CA
certificate, it doesn't crash either.  So it seems it is a combination
with the particular CA certificate and server key/certificate that you
sent.

I'm going away over the weekend, so if anybody here wants to analyze
this further, that would be appreciated.  Here is the recipe to
reproduce the crash:

$ gnutls-serv --x509keyfile key.pem --x509certfile newcert.pem
...
$ gnutls-cli --x509cafile cacert.pem --port 5556 localhost

I'm labeling this problem as GNUTLS-SA-2006-02 because, under some
unclear situations, it is a remotely triggered crash of clients.
