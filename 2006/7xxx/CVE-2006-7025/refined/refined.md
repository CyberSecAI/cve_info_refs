Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability in BookMark4u:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `sqlcmd` parameter being directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization. Specifically, the application takes user-supplied input from the `sqlcmd` POST parameter, performs minimal processing (removing backslashes and replacing `%NL%` with newlines), and then executes this directly as SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not sanitize user-provided SQL commands, making it vulnerable to manipulation by attackers.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code only performs basic replacements and fails to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected into the database queries.
- **Multiple Query Execution:** The code uses `explode(";", $qry)` which allows execution of multiple SQL statements in a single request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This includes the ability to:
    - Modify data, as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC) that changes the admin password.
    - Add new users
    - Drop tables
    - Extract sensitive information.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on database privileges, attackers could potentially gain complete control of the underlying database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to the `config.php` page of the application.
- **`sqlcmd` Parameter:** The SQL injection payload is inserted into the `sqlcmd` POST parameter.
- **`mode` Parameter:** The `mode` parameter must be set to `sqlexec` to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable BookMark4u application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax in order to craft a malicious payload

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in BookMark4u version 2.0.0.
- BookMark4u is considered abandonware and will not be updated.
- The provided PoC changes the administrator password to `asdfg`.
- The `%NL%` is used to encode newlines which are required in SQL statements that involve multiple queries.
