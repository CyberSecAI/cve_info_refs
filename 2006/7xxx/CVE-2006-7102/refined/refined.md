Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `lang_path` parameter in the `quest_delete.php`, `quest_edit.php`, and `quest_news.php` files of phpBurningPortal quiz-modul-1.0.1. This allows an attacker to inject a remote file path into the `lang_path` parameter, which is then included by the PHP application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI because it includes external files based on user-controlled input without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete takeover of the web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request that includes a URL to a remote malicious file in the `lang_path` parameter. The request is sent to one of the vulnerable PHP files.
- **Command Injection:** The provided exploit code shows that the attacker can also inject a command to be executed on the remote server by using a `shellcmd` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker requires a server that hosts the malicious PHP file they want to include in the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter**: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter `lang_path` and the target file names.
