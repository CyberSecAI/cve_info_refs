# Vulnerable Breasts And Brains? Cancer Scan Tech Has Terrible Password Security

Though the human race is going through a machine trust crisis right now, if the [likes of](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/01/15/elon-musk-puts-down-10-million-to-fight-skynet/) [Elon Musk](http://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/) and [Stephen Hawking](http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulrodgers/2014/12/03/computers-will-destroy-humanity-warns-stephen-hawking/) are to be believed, people continue to rely on technology to keep them alive. There is, undoubtedly, faith in the scanners and imaging systems that fire particles at patients to go beneath the skin and uncover abnormalities, whether tumours or broken bones. But what if the humans who created those technologies didn’t secure them properly from outside tampering, potentially leaving patients open to dangerous doses of radiation? A researcher has uncovered a wide range of X-Ray and CT (computerised tomography) technology that appears to be vulnerable. And it's that old problem, the use of poor passwords, that's to blame.

Looking through reams of publicly accessible documentation, researcher Scott Erven, from consulting firm Protiviti, discovered that one of the biggest medical device providers in the world,
[GE Healthcare](/companies/ge-healthcare/)
, had pushed out a large number of nuclear imaging machines with weak default credentials. These included the Discovery NM750b, a dedicated breast imaging system for mammograms, and the NM670 computerised tomography (CT) scanner, alongside another 13 related technologies from GE.

Erven found default passwords across the devices didn’t adhere to good practice, with just six to seven characters, no symbols and easily-guessable words. For instance, for the breast scanner, the user ID was "insite" with a password of "2getin", whilst the root account for the CT machine had a username of "root" and a password of "install".

The GE Discovery NM630. GE says it advises customers to change weak, guessable default passwords,... [+] though a researcher says in some cases it does the opposite.

An attacker who wanted to take control of the machines would have to find a way onto the hospital network or hope the devices were accessible over the web. Unfortunately, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare bodies are hopelessly exposed, according to Erven's findings. Using the [Shodan search tool](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/09/04/shodan-terrifying-search-engine/), he found hundreds of healthcare organisations whose internal systems were accessible over the web. Indeed, a cursory use of [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), using searches including the terms "org:hospital" and "org:health", reveals a large number of critical systems that can be reached from a laptop anywhere in the world.

In one case, an unnamed organisation with more than 12,000 employees exposed intelligence on over 68,000 systems and “provided direct attack vector to the systems”, according to a slide used by Erven for his research presentation at [the Shakacon security conference today](http://shakacon.org/). He was able to map out the kinds of devices used in the organisation, including 488 cardiology and 133 infusion systems, as well as specific known vulnerabilities that could be used by a malicious hacker to get entry onto the network.

Erven told GE about the issues back in August last year, before informing the US government-funded Industrial Control System Computer Emergency Response
[Team](/companies/team/)
 (ICS-CERT). He is unsure whether GE is going to address the problems, saying the company’s response was to say they were just default passwords and could be changed. But Erven said in some cases the documentation specifically asked the user not to change default passwords, as it may prevent GE services providing support. Erven often found it hard to find any information from GE on how to change passwords.

"GE Healthcare’s general recommendation is that customers should change default passwords on their healthcare devices wherever possible to increase the protection and security of their medical systems, and guidance is provided in device documentation," a GE Healthcare spokesperson said.

"It is important for our customers to decide on the levels of security they place on all their medical technology to ensure availability for their care needs as it will depend on how the devices are used in a hospital setting.  GE Healthcare significantly invests in privacy and security and will continue staff training to support our customers."

The dangers of an attack on nuclear imaging technology are patent. First, there's the risk that private data, literally data from under people's skin, could be stolen, as well as any other patient information stored on the affected machine. Second, if the configuration can be changed and the dosing increased, there's a physical threat, according to Erven.

[Nuclear imaging](http://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging) sees patients exposed to ionizing radiation, where particles penetrate tissue to map out the innards of the body. Such radiation can damage DNA and high doses might increase the risk of cancer.

Scott Erven has uncovered serious shortcomings in the healthcare industry when it comes to security.

This is all theoretical; no known attacks on medical devices have ever occurred and patients have no reason to panic. But this should act as a wake-up call to the healthcare industry, which, says Erven, is "15 years behind what we see in retail and finance in terms of what we see in security". Even though the likes of GE and its competitors started to take security seriously towards the end of the last decade, it "takes many years to see the result of what they’re putting into place today". And the problem is "systemic" across manufacturers of medical technology.

He [found similar problems last year](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/hospital-equipment-vulnerable/), when Erven was granted access to a range of medical devices in facilities owned by Essentia Health, which runs a range of clinics across Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin and Idaho. He found that weak or hardcoded credentials in Bluetooth defibrilators, drug infusion pumps and medical record systems meant they could all be manipulated by hackers.
