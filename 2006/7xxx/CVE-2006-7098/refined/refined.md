      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7098",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": "The vulnerability arises from the Apache web server not properly detaching from the controlling terminal when started, particularly when the `-F` option is not used or when started via init scripts. The `033_-F_NO_SETSID` patch, intended to address a separate issue, disabled the use of `setsid()`, which resulted in the Apache process retaining a controlling terminal. This allows a local attacker, who gains control over an Apache process (e.g., through a CGI script), to inject commands into the controlling terminal using the `TIOCSTI` ioctl, potentially escalating privileges to root if the shell from which Apache was started is still open.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Improper handling of process session and controlling terminal detachment.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Apache process retains a controlling terminal, which can be accessed via `/dev/tty` and manipulated using `TIOCSTI`.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Privilege escalation from `www-data` user (or another user the webserver runs as) to root. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as root.\n\nAttack vectors: A compromised Apache process, such as through a vulnerable CGI script or other means, can inject commands via the controlling terminal.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: Local access to the server, control over an Apache process, and the shell that started Apache must be open and must be a root shell to execute the attack successfully."
