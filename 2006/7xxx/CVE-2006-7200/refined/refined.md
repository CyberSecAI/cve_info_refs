The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in Bank of America's SiteKey security system and similar systems, it does not reference or describe a specific CVE

Based on the content provided:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the design of SiteKey, which relies on a server-side approach to verify the legitimacy of a website. The system can be circumvented using a man-in-the-middle attack due to the lack of end-to-end security.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Attackers can create a fake website that retrieves the legitimate SiteKey image and text phrase from the bank's server in real time and displays it to the victim, thus bypassing the security measure.
*   **Bypass Token:** The system uses a persistent "bypass token" stored on the user's computer to skip challenge questions in future logins, this can be stolen and replayed, allowing unlimited access with just username and password.
*   **Lack of End-to-End Security:** SiteKey does not verify that the client receiving the image is the intended recipient, allowing an attacker to proxy the communications between the victim and the bank.
*  **Token Persistence:** Tokens are difficult for users to remove, do not require secure connections, and can be transferred to another computer.
*   **Misleading Marketing Claims:**  Banks may overstate the security provided by SiteKey, giving users a false sense of security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can obtain user credentials (username and password), bypass security questions, and gain unauthorized access to the victim's bank account.
*   Attackers can perform unauthorized transactions, steal funds, or commit other fraudulent activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Phishing Emails:** Lure victims to a fake web page through emails that appear legitimate.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercept and modify communications between the victim and the bank's server.
*  **Token Theft:** Steal the challenge bypass token from a compromised computer and use it to bypass security on another computer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to create a fake website that can proxy requests to the legitimate bank server.
*   Ability to intercept and modify web traffic between the victim and the bank.
*   No special access to bank servers is needed. The attacker needs to operate a server with basic HTTP or TCP capabilities, or compromise a computer with these capabilities.
