\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
A security problem was fixed in imlib2 where loading a specific XPM
file could corrupt memory. (CVE-2008-5187)
Affected products: SLED 10 SP2, SLE SDK 10 (updates for other products
were already released)
- valgrind
valgrind reads a file .valgrindrc in the current directory.
Therefore local users could place such a file a world writable
directory such as /tmp and influence other users' valgrind when it's
executed there (CVE-2008-4865).
Affected products: SLES9/SDK (updates for other products were already
released)
- kvm
Rogue VNC clients could make the built in VNC server of kvm run into
an infinite loop (CVE-2008-2382)
An off-by-one bug limited the length of VNC passwords to seven
instead of eight (CVE-2008-5714)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a buffer overflow in the network emulation code via large
ethernet frames (CVE-2007-5729)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a heap based buffer overflow in the Cirrus Graphics card
emulation (CVE-2007-1320).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- cups
Previous updates for the PNG and HPGL filters were incomplete and
are corrected now (CVE-2008-3641, CVE-2008-5286).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3, 11.0, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- lynx
This update of lynx fixes two security bugs:
- untrusted search path allows execution of arbitrary commands via
.mailcap or mime.types file (CVE-2006-7234)
- when advanced mode is enabled and lynx is used as URL handler, remote
attackers can execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2008-4690)
Affected products: NLD 9 SDK, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLES SDK 9 (updates for
other products were already released)
- xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command execution
was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an xterm.
(CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLE10-SP2, (SLES9 packages will
be released within this week)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Subject: lynx: uses .mime.types and .mailcap from the current directory (arbitrary shell code execution)
Date: Fri, 3 Nov 2006 21:34:53 +0100
```
Package: lynx-cur
Version: 2.8.7dev1-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Lynx attempts to use the .mime.types and .mailcap files located in the
current directory:

$ strace lynx -dump 2>&1 | grep '^open("[^/]'
open(".mailcap", O_RDONLY)              = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open(".mime.types", O_RDONLY)           = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
$

This allows an attacker to cause lynx to execute arbitrary shell code when a
user runs lynx while visiting a directory with attacker-provided contents.

That's inaccurate:  the mime files are read at startup, not "while visiting a
directory".  Reading it from the user's starting directory is as pointed out,
not good, but not in the same realm as indicated in the report.

Version 2.8.7dev2 attempts to fix the bug by checking if the user owns
the .mime.types and .mailcap files before opening them. The assumption
that user trusts the files he owns, is, however, flawed. Consider, for
an example:

* files downloaded by the user
* files unpacked by the user from an archive
* files on a filesystem mounted by the user

...none of which would be executed by the user unknowingly (and could
equally be confused with his home directory), and furthermore, the comment
does not address my point that the files are read once at startup

The secondary issue of files which the user trusts, but may not want to be
executed can be addressed by changing the customized lynx.cfg to use
"~/.mailcap" and "~/.mime.types", etc., to ensure that the default
configuration uses files from the user's home directory.

The response that I just read will still not be addressed, since it's
still possible to make a case where the user downloads into his home
directory.  But the given examples were absurd, so perhaps we can
disregard them.

Unfortunately, the patch is flawed; the logic is basically:

  1. Stat the file.
  2. If not owned by the user, abort.
  3. Read the file.

There's nothing that says the status can't change between 1 and 3, so we have
a race condition; IOW, the bug is still there, only slightly harder to
exploit.

Actually, the upstream CHANGES file also claims this release checks
that the paths for PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP and PERSONAL_MAILCAP are absolute,
but this appears to be a typo; from the diff it is clear that what's checked
are the _global_ type and extension maps.

It's somewhat more than that.  The point of adding the check was to ensure
that files in the user's home directory (the ultimate goal, for dev.3/dev.4)
are not world-writable.

dev.4 is current (from yesterday).  Let's focus on the current code, not
the first step that I took.

yes - that's a cut/paste error that I fixed in the dev.3 patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c0)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-06 15:44:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Lynx reads .mailcap and .mime.types from its CWD, making it possible for a malicious person to make it execute arbitrairy code when user launches lynx while its working directory contains attacker-provided contents.  Steps to Reproduce:  $ cat .mime.types application/x-bug       bug $ cat .mailcap application/x-bug; xmessage 'Hello, World!' $ cat poc.bug $ lynx poc.bug  ( xmessage 'Hello, World!' ) < /home/lkundrak/L28618-1037TMP.bin  ...  Fix:  Make lynx read files from ~ instead of CWD. Debian patch is unusable here, they completly remove code for reading the files in question.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c1)  Thomas E. Dickey    2006-11-07 00:02:14 UTC  ``` This is more accurate than the Debian report, which does not distinguish between the starting directory and directories which lynx may visit.  I prefer (unless someone can point out a flaw) to use IsOurFile() to verify that the file is safe to read.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c2)  Thomas E. Dickey    2006-11-15 11:11:00 UTC  ``` Depending on the use, the Debian patch has some limited value. As I noted, I added logic to use IsOurFile() to reduce the scope (and that patch is easily resync'd to 2.8.5).  Properly handling the user's mailcap/mime file settings is harder. The effect of the Debian patch is to always append that setting to the user's home-path.  It doesn't check if the global setting is not a relative path.  I added a check for the latter, and chose to address the user's settings by making tilde-expansion in those work - and then enforcing absolute pathnames for the user's settings. That's in lynx 2.8.7dev.4 (resyncing the tilde expansion stuff is more work).  I'd suggest adding the 2.8.6rel.3 patch (for IsOurFile), and combining that with the Debian patch for fixes to older releases.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c3)  Thomas E. Dickey    2006-11-15 12:55:49 UTC  ``` I'll work on this, this evening to put together a possible patch to combine the different aspects.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c4)  Thomas E. Dickey    2006-11-16 00:45:25 UTC  ``` See  <http://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.6/patches/> <http://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.5/patches/> <http://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.4/patches/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-25 18:10:56 UTC  ``` For the sake of completeness...  This issue was fixed upstream in 2.8.6rel.4.  As of this version, lynx will not search current working directory for PERSONAL_MAILCAP (.mailcap by default) and PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP (.mime.types by default) files, but will only try to find those files in the user's home directory.  Patches for older versions: ftp://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.5/patches/2.8.5rel.6.patch.gz ftp://lynx.isc.org/lynx2.8.4/patches/lynx2.8.4rel.1e.patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2008-10-27 16:38:45 UTC  ``` CVE id [CVE-2006-7234](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-7234) was assigned to this issue:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in Lynx before 2.8.6rel.4 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via malicious (1) .mailcap and (2) mime.types files in the current working directory.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c12)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-10-28 08:18:50 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008-0965.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=214205#c13)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2009-10-23 19:05:32 UTC  ``` Reporter changed to security-response-team by request of Jay Turner.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: lynx (old) .mailcap handling flaw

Hi Steven!

There's one old lynx issue that seem to need a 2006 CVE id.  lynx
browser prior to 2.8.6rel.4 tries to open mailcap and mime type
definition files form the current directory.  If user can be convinced
to run lynx in a specially crafted directory, an attacker controlling
the directory may be able to run arbitrary code as the victim running
lynx.

Issue was originally reported in Debian BTS:
  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=396949>

Some details can be found in our BZ as well:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=214205>

Thank you!
