GPG key: 0x56143F84
APPLICATION
call-center software
http://www.call-center-software.org/
"call-center-software is a free open-source application
released under the GPL"
AFFECTED VERSIONS
Versions 0.93 and below
ISSUES
Call-Center-Software is vulnerable to multiple SQL
injection attacks and XSS under certain conditons,
along with privilege escalation.
1) XSS
Call-Center-Software does not escape data when handling
it allowing malicious javascript data to be inserted by
any user.This is only when Magic Quotes is disabled
within PHP.
Example:
A user entering <script>alert("Moo!");</script> into
the problem description field when submitting the
problem, will cause the javascript to be executed
upon viewing or editting the problem.
2) SQL Injection
Call-Center-Software does not escape data when handling
it allowing malicious users to inject SQL commands into
the database. This is only when Magic Quotes is
disabled within PHP.
Example: By logging into the system with the user
"'or 1=1 or 1='" the attacker is let into the system with
full administrative privileges.
3) Privilege Escalation and Password Disclosure
Call-Center-Software does not check access privileges
when bringing up the "edit user" screen. This, also
combined with the lack of hashed password, discloses
any user on the system's password, username, and other
information stored within the database.
Example: When logged in as a non administrative user
a user can go to edit\_user.php?user\_id=1 and view the
default admin account's password. Changing the
user\_id variable discloses the corresponding account's
data.
WORKAROUNDS
Enabling Magic Quotes will negate the XSS and SQL
injection attacks on affected systems.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
