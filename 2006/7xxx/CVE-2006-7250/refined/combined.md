Subject: CVE request: openssl: null pointer dereference issue

Hi Kurt, Steve, vendors,

bad S/MIME messages with crafted MIME headers can result in a NULL pointer
dereference in openssl's ans1 parser,

 <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=748738>
 [http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg30305.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev%40openssl.org/msg30305.html)
 <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22144>

Does it qualify for a CVE?

Thanks, Matthias

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

# USN-1424-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities

19 April 2012

An application using OpenSSL could be made to crash or run programs if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL could be made to dereference a NULL pointer

when processing S/MIME messages. A remote attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service. These issues did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

([CVE-2006-7250](/security/CVE-2006-7250), [CVE-2012-1165](/security/CVE-2012-1165))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that OpenSSL did not properly perform bounds

checking when processing DER data via BIO or FILE functions. A remote

attacker could trigger this flaw in services that used SSL to cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with application

privileges. ([CVE-2012-2110](/security/CVE-2012-2110))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.17)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.4)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.10)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=798100#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-28 03:10:21 UTC  ``` "openssl smime -verify -in" verifies the signature of the input file and the "-verify" switch expects a signed or encrypted input file. Previously, running openssl on an S/MIME file that was not encrypted or signed caused openssl to segfault. With this update, the input file is now checked for a signature or encryption. Consequently, openssl now returns an error and quits when attempting to verify an unencrypted or unsigned S/MIME file.  This was fixed in RHSA-2009:1335:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1335.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=798100#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-28 23:04:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 566411](attachment.cgi?id=566411&action=diff "openssl PR: 2711 Tolerate bad MIME headers in parser") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=566411&action=edit "openssl PR: 2711 Tolerate bad MIME headers in parser") openssl PR: 2711 Tolerate bad MIME headers in parser  Patch is from RHEL-6 OpenSSL source RPM   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=798100#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-29 09:34:25 UTC  ``` This problem was previously reported via (private) [bug #472440](show_bug.cgi?id=472440) and addressed as non-security bug fix in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 packages in 2009 via RHSA-2009:1335:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1335.html>  This patch was also included in openssl and openssl098e packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 since the initial release.  It's also included in current Fedora packages.  Patch is names as openssl-*-bad-mime.patch  Later in 2012, it was discovered that the fix was previously not pushed upstream and that was done via:   <http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=132886769402643&w=2>   <http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2711&user=guest&pass=guest>  and applied upstream in:   <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22147> (cvs head)   and cn 22144, 22145, 22146 for commits to 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 branches  There was some confusion around CVE assignment due to a use of the CVE in unrelated bug report:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/7012>   [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/7005/focus=7035](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/7005/focus%3D7035)  [CVE-2006-7248](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-7248) was previously used for this issue.  Statement:  This issue was corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2009:1335. It did not affect openssl packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ``` |  |

Due to the Novell/kadu miss-paste this CVE needs to be re-issued. Please
use CVE-2006-7250 for this OpenSSL issue.

```
In some cases when a S/MIME message with broken MIME headers is
processed a NULL dereference in mime_hdr_cmp can happen. The attached
patch guards against this dereference.
