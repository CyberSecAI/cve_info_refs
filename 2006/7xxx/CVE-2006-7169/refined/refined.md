```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a file inclusion vulnerability in the `header_simple.php` script. The `skin_dir` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `header_simple.php` with a manipulated `_CONFIG[skin_dir]` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a server hosting a malicious PHP script. The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the vulnerable server."
