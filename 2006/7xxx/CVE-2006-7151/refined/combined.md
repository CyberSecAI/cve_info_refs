| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c0)  Enrico Scholz    2006-10-08 13:17:47 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  libltdl seems to be built in some way which results into a library-searchpath containing relative paths:  E.g.  --- victim.c ---- #include <ltdl.h>  int main() {         lt_dlinit();         lt_dlhandle     h = lt_dlopenext("foo");         void            (*f)(void) = lt_dlsym(h, "foo");         (*f)(); } ----  --- foo.c --- void foo() {         write(1, "got you...\n", 11); } ----  | $ gcc -g3 -O0 victim.c -o bin/victim -lltdl | $ libtool --mode=compile gcc -g3 -O0 -c foo.c | $ libtool --mode=link gcc -rpath `pwd`/bin/nosegneg -module -avoid-version  -o foo.la foo.lo | $ libtool --mode=install install foo.la `pwd`/bin/hwcap/foo.la |  | $ cd bin | $ strace ./victim | open("/lib/foo.la", O_RDONLY)           = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) | open("/usr/lib/foo.la", O_RDONLY)       = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) | open("hwcap/foo.la", O_RDONLY)          = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) | open("0/foo.la", O_RDONLY)              = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) | open("nosegneg/foo.la", O_RDONLY)       = 3 | ... | write(1, "got you...\n", 11got you... | ...   This relative paths are in libltdl.so:  | $ strings /usr/lib/libltdl.so | grep hwc | /lib:/usr/lib:hwcap:0:nosegneg:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/qt-3.3/lib | /lib:/usr/lib:hwcap:0:nosegneg:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/mysql:/usr/lib/qt-3.3/lib   The 'mysql' and 'qt' paths do not seem to be ok either.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  libtool-ltdl-1.5.22-2.3   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c1)  Karsten Hopp    2006-11-06 13:57:05 UTC  ``` partly caused by /etc/ld.so.conf.d/kernelcap-* from the kernel-xen package which puts some varaiables instead of directories into the configfile. I have a patch to ignore everything which doesn't looks like an absolute path in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*, but I still have 'open("foo.la", O_RDONLY)' which I'm looking for right now.     ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c2)  Karsten Hopp    2006-11-06 15:55:14 UTC  ``` Can you try out <http://people.redhat.com/karsten/libtool-1.5.22-2.7.src.rpm> , please ? It should ignore the entries in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/kernelcap-* and shouldn't look in the current working directory for .la files. Please try to start some programs linked with libltdl and post any findings here. Thanks !   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c3)  Lubomir Kundrak    2006-11-20 20:13:10 UTC  ``` Would't it be better if sys_search_path[] was determined system's actual configuration at runtime? From my point of view hardcoding it and depending on build host setup makes no sense for pre-compiled binary based system. But I am unaware of a possible performance penalty, would there be any?    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c4)  Karsten Hopp    2007-01-23 17:12:28 UTC  ``` fixed in the latest rawhide package   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=209930#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-25 13:31:41 UTC  ``` Upstream commit, noted for posterity: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtool.git/commit/?id=b3251f4d7e86d0bd4901de62cd9bcd18ddd7965a>   ``` |  |
