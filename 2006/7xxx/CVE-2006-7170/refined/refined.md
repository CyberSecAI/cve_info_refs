Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in Mega Mall, as described in the email:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `product_review.php` and `order-track.php` scripts of the Mega Mall application. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code and expose the full path of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via multiple parameters in the `product_review.php` script (`t`, `productId`, `sk`, `x`, `so`) and the `orderNo` parameter in the `order-track.php` script. These parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to database compromise.
2.  **Full Path Disclosure:** The application discloses the full server path due to improper handling of the `x` parameter in `product_review.php`, likely via an error message. This information can help attackers in further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, including user information, product details, order history, and potentially payment information.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially escalate privileges within the database server.
    *   **Application Compromise:** In some scenarios, attackers can use SQL Injection to gain remote code execution on the webserver.
2.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Information Gathering:** Attackers can gain information about the server's file structure and configuration, which could aid in subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The SQL injection attacks are carried out by manipulating URL parameters within HTTP GET requests or POST requests with the `orderNo` variable, inserting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.
2.  **Full Path Disclosure:** This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specifically crafted request to `product_review.php` including `x` parameter as array `x[]=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the SQL Injection and Full Path Disclosure vulnerabilities on these URLs.
