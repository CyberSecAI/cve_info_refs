      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure form handling in `include/inc_act/act_formmailer.php` allows for spam sending by faking the HTTP_REFERER.",

	"Database password and user data leakage.",
         "The lack of input sanitization on POST and GET data, allowing for potential injection attacks."

      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could create admin accounts, modify the website content, send spam emails, download sensitive data such as database passwords, and execute arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vector": "By exploiting vulnerabilities in the `act_formmailer.php` and `mail_file_form.php` files. The `mail_file_form.php` vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious PHP code via the `$_POST['nome_evento']` parameter, which is then executed by the `render_PHPcode()` function.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts, which is typically possible from any internet-connected device. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability in `mail_file_form.php`."
