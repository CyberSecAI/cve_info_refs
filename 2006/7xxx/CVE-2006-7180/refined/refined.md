      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7180",
      "source": "bugs.gentoo.org_6ac608e2_20250126_121315.html",
      "details": "This bug report discusses a sandbox violation in gnome-print-0.34. Specifically, the gnome-font-install utility has '/etc/gnome' hardcoded, which causes a sandbox violation when the directory doesn't exist during the first execution. Subsequent executions after the directory is created do not trigger the violation as the directory then exists. The fix involved moving the execution of `gnome-font-install` from `make install` to `pkg_postinst()` to avoid the sandbox issue during the initial install phase.",
      "root_cause": "Hardcoded path '/etc/gnome' in gnome-font-install utility which is run during the installation process. This path is created outside of the sandboxed environment.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Hardcoded path leading to sandbox violation.",
        "Improper installation process."
      ],
      "impact": "Sandbox violation during package installation, not a traditional security vulnerability with direct impact on system security or data.",
      "attack_vectors": "Not a traditional attack vector but an issue with the installation procedure. Occurs during initial package installation within a sandboxed environment.",
       "required_capabilities": "No attacker capabilities needed. Issue is triggered during package installation."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7180",
        "source": "www.ubuntu.com_89404d97_20250125_215020.html",
      "details": "A flaw was discovered in the MadWifi driver that would allow unencrypted network traffic to be sent prior to finishing WPA authentication. A physically near-by attacker could capture this, leading to a loss of privacy, denial of service, or network spoofing.",
      "root_cause": "The MadWifi driver sends unencrypted network traffic before WPA authentication is complete.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unencrypted traffic sent before WPA authentication",
        "Weak WPA implementation"
      ],
      "impact": "Loss of privacy, denial of service, or network spoofing through captured unencrypted traffic",
      "attack_vectors": "A physically near-by attacker capturing the unencrypted network traffic.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be physically close and able to capture wireless network traffic."

      "source": "security.gentoo.org_706b9b3e_20250125_215013.html",
      "details": "The MadWifi driver vulnerability allows unencrypted packets to be sent before WPA authentication succeeds. This is one of multiple vulnerabilities addressed in GLSA 200704-15 related to the MadWifi driver. Other issues addressed include an abnormal channel change and improper handling of AUTH frames.",
     "root_cause": "The driver sends unencrypted packets prior to the completion of WPA authentication.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unencrypted packets sent before WPA authentication."

      "impact": "A remote attacker could gain access to sensitive network information by sniffing unencrypted packets.",
      "attack_vectors": "Remote attacker sniffing wireless network traffic.",
        "required_capabilities": "Remote attacker must be in range to sniff unencrypted wireless network traffic"
