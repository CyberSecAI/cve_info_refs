8 pages of google show a single installation and the very last hit the
(now defunct?) vendor page:

<http://phpjobboard.sourceforge.net/>
[DIR] Parent Directory        18-Nov-2002 05:48      -
Apache/1.3.33 Server at phpjobboard.sourceforge.net Port 80

The one installation <http://www.moneyinstitute.com/phpjobboard/> which
doesn't seem set up properly, as it shows index listing. Kind of amusing,
the uploads directory has resumes in it. Requesting any of the three sub
dirs in the modules/ directories gives path disclosures.

Following standard sourceforge hierarchy,
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpjobboard> works:

PHP Job Board     Stats - Activity: 19.61% RSS
This project hopes to provide an open-source system that is similar to
Monster.com. Project goals are 1) VERY simple install, and minimal
requirements. This system will be support on any webserver platform that
can run PHP, and it will work with any dat

But, checking the 'files' available:

<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61962>
No File Packages Defined
This project has not yet created any file release packages.

The files *are* available via CVS though:
<http://phpjobboard.cvs.sourceforge.net/phpjobboard/phpjobboard/html/>
