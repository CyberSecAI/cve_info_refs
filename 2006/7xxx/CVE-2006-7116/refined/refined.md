Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Kubix 0.7:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses a `theme` cookie value to include a header file without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `includes/head.php` script uses the `$_COOKIE['theme']` value in an `include` statement, which makes it vulnerable to LFI when combined with a null byte.
    *   **Weakness:**  Lack of input validation on the `theme` cookie, specifically not preventing directory traversal and the use of a null byte.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious cookie with a `theme` value containing directory traversal sequences (`../`) and a null byte (`%00`). For example: `../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and set cookies. The attacker would be external and unauthenticated. This exploit will only work if magic quotes is set to `off`.

2.  **Login Bypass:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The authentication mechanism relies on cookies (`member_id` and `pass_hash`) and SQL queries without proper input validation.
    *   **Weakness:** The application uses the `member_id` cookie directly in a SQL query without sanitization, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the login system and gain unauthorized access by crafting a malicious SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker sets the `member_id` cookie with a value like `1--` which comments out the rest of the SQL query.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and set the `member_id` cookie. The attacker would be external and unauthenticated.

3.  **Arbitrary File Download:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `add_dl.php` script in the admin section allows specifying a file to include in the downloads database. It checks if the file exists before adding to database but does not prevent the usage of directory traversal.
    *   **Weakness:** The application checks if a file exists locally before adding it to a download list but does not sanitize the path which allows for directory traversal to access files outside of the download directory.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with valid admin access can download arbitrary files from the server, which might include configuration files or source code.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker logs in as an administrator, sends a POST request to `adm_index.php?mod=add_dl` with the file parameter set to `../includes/connect.php`. After this, the attacker requests a crafted URL to download the file.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs valid admin credentials to access the `add_dl.php` form. The attacker is considered internal after being authenticated.
