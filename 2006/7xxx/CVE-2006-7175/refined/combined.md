| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c0)  Dave Miller    2005-11-03 07:15:53 UTC  ``` Description of problem: SSLv2 is not considered secure anymore.  Sendmail by default enables all ciphers supported by openssl.  In order to disable SSLv2, you need to use the CipherList directive in the LOCAL_CONFIG section of the sendmail.mc file.  (<http://sial.org/howto/sendmail/cipherlist/>)  However, the sendmail shipped with RHEL4 does not support this directive.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): sendmail-8.13.1-2  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Add "O CipherList=<list of ciphers>" to your LOCAL_CONFIG section of sendmail.mc 2.make 3.service sendmail restart    Actual results: Starting sendmail: 554 5.0.0 /etc/mail/sendmail.cf: line 169: readcf: unknown option name CipherList  Expected results: Sendmail starts and restricts SSLv2 usage  Ideally, RedHat would ship with this already enabled and configured to restrict SSLv2  Additional info: I successfully recompiled the SRPM to enable this option with the following patch:  --- sendmail.spec.orig  Wed Nov  2 23:11:03 2005 +++ sendmail.spec       Wed Nov  2 22:56:45 2005 @@ -140,7 +140,7 @@  cat > redhat.config.m4 << EOF  define(\`confMAPDEF', \`-DNEWDB -DNIS -DHESIOD -DMAP_REGEX')  define(\`confOPTIMIZE', \`${RPM_OPT_FLAGS}') -define(\`confENVDEF', \`-I/usr/include/db3 -I/usr/kerberos/include -Wall -DXDEBUG=0 -DTCPWRAPPERS -DNETINET6 -DHES_GETMAILHOST -DUSE_VENDOR_CF_PATH=1 -D_FFR_WORKAROUND_BROKEN_NAMESERVERS -D_FFR_SMTP_SSL') +define(\`confENVDEF', \`-I/usr/include/db3 -I/usr/kerberos/include -Wall -DXDEBUG=0 -DTCPWRAPPERS -DNETINET6 -DHES_GETMAILHOST -DUSE_VENDOR_CF_PATH=1 -D_FFR_WORKAROUND_BROKEN_NAMESERVERS -D_FFR_SMTP_SSL -D_FFR_TLS_1')  define(\`confLIBDIRS', \`-L/usr/kerberos/%{_lib}')  define(\`confLIBS', \`-lnsl -lwrap -lhesiod -lcrypt -ldb')  define(\`confMANOWN', \`root')  (beware of line wrapping in Bugzilla -- the important part is adding the -D_FFR_TLS_1 to the end of confENVDEF)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c1)  RHEL Program Management    2006-08-18 17:06:38 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2007-04-27 10:59:11 UTC  ``` Whilst we're going to add support for CipherList in the upcoming update, Sendmail classes the CipherList directive as "for future release"; currently unsupported and undocumented. Therefore the lack of support for the CipherList directive in various Red Hat products is not a vulnerability.  We've disputed [CVE-2006-7175](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-7175).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c7)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-05-01 17:12:21 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0252.html>    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c8)  Dave Miller    2007-05-09 22:53:35 UTC  ``` I would say this *is* a vulnerability, not so much that CipherList isn't supported, but that SSLv1 *is* supported without it.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=172352#c9)  Dave Miller    2007-05-09 22:54:29 UTC  ``` er, I meant SSLv2, but you know what I meant. :)   ``` |  |
