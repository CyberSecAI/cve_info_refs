  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an insecure file inclusion in the `startup.php` script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `CFG_PHPGIGGLE_ROOT` parameter in the URL, an attacker can specify a remote file to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. They also need access to a file that can be included from the server, like a web shell."
