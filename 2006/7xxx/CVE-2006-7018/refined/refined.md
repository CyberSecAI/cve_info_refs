    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2006-7018",
      "source": "www.phpwcms.de_9b30fb4b_20250125_120608.html",
      "root_cause": "Unsanitized user input passed to a function that executes PHP code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure code practices",
        "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Arbitrary code execution",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) possible via crafted input (not explicitly stated but implied)"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the affected system and data, including the ability to create admin users, download the database and database credentials.",
      "attack_vector": "Specifically, the vulnerability was found in the `phpwcms_code_snippets/mail_file_form.php` file and also within include/inc_act/act_formmailer.php . By manipulating user-controlled input (specifically `$_POST['nome_evento']`) sent to `mail_file_form.php` , an attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code. The `act_formmailer.php` could be abused for spam by faking the HTTP_REFERER.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable scripts, which can be done by a remote, unauthenticated attacker. They also need knowledge of the vulnerable files and parameters."
