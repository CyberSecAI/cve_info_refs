| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=38859#c0)  Ruediger Pluem    2006-03-05 17:09:49 UTC  ``` The AJP connector of Tomcat 5.5.15 contained a bug that sometimes set a too long length for the chunks delivered by send_body_chunks AJP messages. This is fixed meanwhile by <http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi?rev=381505&view=rev>.  A bug of this type can cause mod_jk to read beyond buffer boundaries and thus reveal sensitive memory information to a client. The attached patch against mod_jk 1.2.15 adds a sanity check to prevent mod_jk from reading beyond buffer boundaries in such cases. This protects mod_jk against buggy or malicious AJP servers in the backend. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=38859#c1)  Ruediger Pluem    2006-03-05 17:10:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17837](attachment.cgi?id=17837&action=diff "Patch against mod_jk 1.2.15") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17837&action=edit "Patch against mod_jk 1.2.15") Patch against mod_jk 1.2.15 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=38859#c2)  Mladen Turk    2006-03-16 08:18:26 UTC  ``` Commited. Thanks! ``` |  |
