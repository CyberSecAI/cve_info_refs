Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24352:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-24352. Specifically, the advisory from NetApp ([`security.netapp.com_d910dc20_20250119_121802.html`](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201123-0003)) explicitly names "CVE-2020-24352 QEMU Vulnerability in NetApp Products", and the Red Hat Bugzilla entry ([`access.redhat.com_c6a0e89f_20250119_135756.html`](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-24352)) references "CVE-2020-24352 QEMU: out-of-bounds read/write in ati-vga device emulation in ati_2d_blt()".

**2. Extracted Information:**

   * **Root Cause:**
      - The vulnerability lies in the ATI VGA device emulation within QEMU.
      - An out-of-bounds read/write occurs in the `ati_2d_blt()` function when handling MMIO write operations.

   * **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      - Out-of-bounds memory access.

   * **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Denial of service (DoS)
      - A malicious guest user can crash the QEMU process on the host.

   * **Attack Vectors:**
      - The vulnerability is triggered through MMIO write operations from a malicious guest OS.

   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - Attacker needs to have control of a guest OS running on a vulnerable QEMU instance.
      - Low privileges within the guest OS are sufficient.

**3. Additional details:**

   - The vulnerability affects QEMU versions up to 5.1.0.
   - NetApp states that it's not affected by the vulnerability.
   - Red Hat notes that the ATI VGA emulation feature was introduced in QEMU upstream version 4.0.0.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The core issue is an out-of-bounds read/write in the `ati_2d_blt()` function within QEMU's ATI VGA emulation code. This is triggered via MMIO write operations from a malicious guest. Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition where the QEMU process on the host crashes. An attacker needs control over a guest OS to exploit this.
