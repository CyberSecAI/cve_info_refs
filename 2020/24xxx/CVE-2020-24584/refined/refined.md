Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-24584 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in how Django, specifically when using Python 3.7 or higher, handled permissions for intermediate-level directories within the file system cache. Instead of using the intended `0o077` umask (which would restrict permissions to the owner only), it was using the system's default umask. This could lead to overly permissive file system permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Directory Permissions:**  The core weakness is the failure to apply the correct umask (0o077) to intermediate-level directories created during file system caching. This means directories might have group or world write permissions.

*   **Permission Escalation Potential:** While not a direct vulnerability itself, the incorrect umask setting could lead to permission escalation. This means that an attacker might gain access or control over these directories due to the overly permissive permissions, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:**  The main impact of exploitation is the potential for unauthorized access to and disclosure of sensitive data, due to the overly permissive directory permissions. This could potentially include cached data.
*   **Permission Escalation**: Due to relaxed permissions, it may become easier for attackers to escalate privileges, as they have increased access to directories that they should not have.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who can manipulate file system access.
*   **File System Cache:** The vulnerable code is in file system cache, making the exploitation target within a specific area of Django's functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access to the Server:** An attacker needs some level of access to the server where Django is running. This is because the vulnerability deals with file system permissions.
*   **Python 3.7+** The server must be running on Python 3.7 or higher to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Django versions 2.2 prior to 2.2.16, 3.0 prior to 3.0.10 and 3.1 prior to 3.1.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is mitigated by setting the correct umask (0o077) before creating intermediate level directories for file system cache.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves updating django and manually reviewing and correcting permissions on the existing intermediate-level directories.
*   **Patches** Specific commits that resolve the issue are referenced for master, 3.1, 3.0 and 2.2 release branches.
*   **NetApp products:** Multiple NetApp products incorporates Django, however the advisory specified that none of their products were affected.

In summary, CVE-2020-24584 arises from a coding flaw where Django did not enforce the correct file system permissions on intermediate cache directories when running on Python 3.7+, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation. The fix requires a software update and reviewing existing file permissions.
