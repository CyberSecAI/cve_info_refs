Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24786:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content directly mentions **CVE-2020-24786** within the release notes of ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer. It states:
    >*"This release includes fix for the CVE-2020-24786 vulnerability, which allowed unauthenticated changes to integration system configuration, reported by Florian Hauser."*
*   This confirms the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication checks in the `/servlet/UpdateProductDetails` servlet.
*   Specifically, by crafting a specific request with the `UPDATE_HA_VIRTUAL_HOST` parameter set to "true" and not providing the `username` parameter bypasses the authentication checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication for the `UpdateProductDetails` servlet.
*   **Unvalidated Input:**  The servlet is vulnerable to unvalidated user input via request parameters, allowing modification of database entries.
*   **Indirect Object Reference:** A request parameter (`EVENTS`) is used to access and trigger methods of specific Executor implementations, which are resolved from a database table, this can be abused to make modifications to database tables.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Modifications:** An attacker can modify database tables, such as `ADSProductDetails`, potentially inserting malicious configurations by manipulating database entries.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the event executor and manipulating the database, it would be possible to insert a malicious entry into the database, which could then be used to gain remote code execution.
*   **Manipulation of Integrations:** The attacker can insert or modify entries to affect integrations with other ManageEngine products. They can also modify Mail Settings, Proxy Settings or SSO configurations.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out via specifically crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/servlet/UpdateProductDetails` endpoint.
*   **Network:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted ManageEngine instance.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable ManageEngine product.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.
*   **No Authentication:** This vulnerability does not require prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `medium.com` provides a very detailed breakdown of the vulnerability, going into specifics of the code and the attack. It gives greater insight than the high level CVE description and other snippets alone.
*   The exploit is categorized as a logical bug, i.e. a flaw in the design of the application, not a coding error (e.g. buffer overflow).
*   The researcher was able to locate multiple potential attack vectors.
