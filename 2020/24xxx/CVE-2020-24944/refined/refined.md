The provided content relates to CVE-2020-24944.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect logical conditions in `picoquic_decode_frames()` and `picoquic_decode_stream_frame()` functions when processing a maliciously crafted QUIC frame.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the QUIC frame parsing logic, specifically during stream frame decoding in epoch 3.
- An infinite loop occurs due to the logical flaws in `picoquic_decode_frames()` and `picoquic_decode_stream_frame()` when handling a specific malformed QUIC frame. This is further detailed in the backtrace which highlights that `picoquic_varint_decode` gets stuck in an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The infinite loop in the QUIC server causes it to stop responding, preventing normal operation.
- In embedded systems where picoquic is used, the infinite loop can halt the entire system due to the lack of a pre-emptive operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is remote and requires no user interaction or authentication.
- A specially crafted QUIC frame is sent to the server, triggering the infinite loop during the frame parsing process in epoch 3.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable QUIC server.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a QUIC frame which will exploit the parsing logic.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed.
