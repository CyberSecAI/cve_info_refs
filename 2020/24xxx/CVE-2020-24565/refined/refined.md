Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24565:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `scanServer64` module of Trend Micro Apex One. This allows for a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability results in a read operation beyond the allocated buffer. This can leak sensitive information.
- Insufficient input validation: The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the affected system.
- Potential privilege escalation: The advisory suggests that this vulnerability, when chained with other vulnerabilities, could potentially lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required for the vulnerability to be exploited. The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged code execution: The attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This suggests that an attacker needs to have compromised an account or found a way to run their own code on the machine.

**Additional details:**
- Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Lynn and Jay Lo.
