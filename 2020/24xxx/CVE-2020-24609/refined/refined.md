Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24609

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields during user registration, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The injected script is stored in the application's database and executed each time the affected data is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
*   When an administrator views the user management section, the injected script is executed within their browser session.
*   This could allow the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the administrator, redirect to malicious websites, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker must register a new user account.
*   The XSS payload is injected into the `first_name` and `last_name` parameters during the registration process.
*   The payload is then triggered when an administrator views the user details through the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the user registration page of the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication is needed before injection, only to trigger the xss, the attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject, only need to make a registration.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameters are `first_name` and `last_name` during user registration.
*   The XSS payload is embedded directly in these fields (e.g., `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`).
*   The injected script is triggered when an administrator visits the "manage users" section of the admin panel.

**Vulnerable Software:**
*   Savsoft Quiz Enterprise Version 5.5 and Savsoft Quiz 5
*   PHP based web application

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit-db entries and github content indicate that this vulnerability is present in Savsoft Quiz version 5.0 and 5.5, with the vulnerability existing in both the standard version and the Enterprise version.
*   The vulnerability is a stored/persistent XSS, meaning the malicious script is permanently stored in the application, and executed when accessed.
