This plugin looks great on the surface. Unfortunately, even after purchasing licenses, it does not function as advertised. In order to get full featured system management you need to pay for the plugins which is understandable but for what was spent here, i could have purchased a license for something far better. In addition, you shouldn’t have to install 10+ plugins to have a full featured system. Managing businesses, people and their invoices way more complex than it needs to be. Wish I knew sooner.

After trying out several member directory plugins, I was relieved to find this one. It is easy to use and not overly cluttered with features I don’t need. It really is perfect for a chamber of commerce website. And it’s reassuring that there is such excellent tech support backing up the product. Very speedy response to a support ticket – less than 2 hours. I’m very impressed so far!

There was a conflict that turned out to be between WordPress and Google. I was exhausted trying to get it fixed, but Chamber Dashboard and Lisa K would not let it go. They came back to me long after I had decided it was just something I had to live with and helped us get a fix. Tech support for this plugin is relentless, knowledgeable and trustworthy. Five stars for the plug in and tech support.

I have been using this plugin and several add-on’s for our local chamber website and everyone loves it. We recently moved hosting and it created some issues with PayPal connectivity and although the issue was not related to the plugin, they were able to point me in the right direction and helped guide me through PayPal settings to fix the issue. They went above and beyond. Great team!

##

 About 1 min

### Issue Description

XSS in WordPress plugin [Chamber Dashboard Business Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/chamber-dashboard-business-directory/).

## Problem

User entered input which contains HTML/JS is not properly encoded on output, resulting in XSS.

Tested on version 3.2.8 (latest)

### Details

Enter payload into affected field (phone field in this example) and update company profile.

In WordPress admin choose Businesses -> All Businesses and entered payload is executed :)

Previous example was around *phone* field, because this is displayed in directory listing and therefore can be used as attack vector with less clicks requried from admin.

Other vulnerable fields include:

* Country
* State
* Social media url
* E-mail
* City
* Zip
* Address
* Location
* Hours
