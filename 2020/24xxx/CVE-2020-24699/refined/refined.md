Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, HTML/JavaScript code entered into various fields within the Chamber Dashboard Business Directory plugin is not properly encoded when displayed, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into various business profile fields. This code is then executed when an admin views the affected listing in the WordPress admin panel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:**  A successful XSS attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, granting attackers access to the victim's WordPress account.
    - **Malicious redirects:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the admin pages.
    - **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Admin account takeover:** Performing actions as the compromised admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the business profile edit form within the plugin. An attacker can inject malicious code into various input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to edit or create business listings through the Chamber Dashboard Business Directory plugin. This usually requires a user account with sufficient privileges on the WordPress site or exploiting a separate vulnerability to achieve the ability to add/edit business listings.
