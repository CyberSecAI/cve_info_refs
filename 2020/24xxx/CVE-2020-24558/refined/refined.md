Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `OfcPIPC_64x.dll` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability occurs because the software does not correctly validate the size of user-provided data before attempting to read it into a buffer, resulting in a read past the end of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure.
- An attacker could read sensitive data from the memory space due to the out-of-bounds read.
- While the vulnerability itself only allows for information disclosure, it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the context of the SYSTEM user, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system to run code, albeit with low privileges.
- The attacker must leverage the vulnerability by supplying crafted or malicious input to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located within the `OfcPIPC_64x.dll` file in Trend Micro Apex One.
- Trend Micro has released an update to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported to Trend Micro on March 31, 2020, with a coordinated public release on August 31, 2020
