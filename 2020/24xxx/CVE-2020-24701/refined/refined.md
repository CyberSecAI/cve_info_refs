The provided content contains multiple vulnerabilities. Here's the breakdown for the relevant ones:

**CVE-2020-24701**

This CVE is associated with three distinct Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:

**1. MWB-492**
   - **Root Cause:** The `/apps/manifests` endpoint's debug option included request parameters in its response without proper HTML escaping.
   - **Vulnerability:** Lack of HTML escaping on user-supplied input in the debug response.
   - **Impact:** Malicious script code execution within a user's context, leading to session hijacking or unwanted actions via the web interface.
   - **Attack Vector:**  A crafted link to the `/apps/manifest` endpoint with a malicious script in a parameter.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim to click on a malicious URL.

**2. MWB-493**
   - **Root Cause:** The logic for determining safe content could be bypassed by providing unknown values for content-disposition when requesting a shared file.
   - **Vulnerability:**  Bypass of safe content checks by providing unexpected content-disposition values.
   - **Impact:** Execution of malicious script code within the user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or unwanted actions via the web interface.
   - **Attack Vector:**  A crafted link to a shared file with an unexpected `content_disposition` parameter value.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim to click on a malicious URL.

**3. MWB-494**
   - **Root Cause:**  Unrestricted access to a cache for internal file handling (e.g., importing vcards) combined with a lack of sanitization of content in that cache.
   - **Vulnerability:** Unauthorized access to a cache for internal file handling, allowing for the delivery of unsanitized script code.
   - **Impact:**  Execution of malicious script code within a user's context, possibly leading to session hijacking.
   - **Attack Vector:** Requires an attacker to guess a 128b UUID of the cached file. Then, the victim needs to click on the link to this cached file.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to include malicious script code in external content like a vcard file and must guess a UUID of the cached file. Then requires the victim to click on a link.

The document also mentions additional XSS vulnerabilities that were assigned to **CVE-2021-26698** and a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability assigned to **CVE-2021-26699**, as well as two SSRF vulnerabilities with no CVE assigned (MWB-423 and MWB-460)
