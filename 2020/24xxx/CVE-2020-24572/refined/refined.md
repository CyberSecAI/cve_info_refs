Based on the provided content, CVE-2020-24572 is related to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the `raspap-webgui` project. This vulnerability was addressed by removing the webconsole feature.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a flaw in the webconsole feature, which used json-rpc. This suggests the json-rpc implementation had insufficient input validation or authorization checks, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) via json-rpc
- Insufficient input validation or authorization in the webconsole

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would be the web interface of `raspap-webgui`, specifically the vulnerable webconsole feature. By sending malicious json-rpc requests, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need network access to the server running `raspap-webgui`.
- The attacker would also need to be able to craft malicious json-rpc requests.

**Additional Notes:**
The commit message `Remove webconsole, fixes RCE via json-rpc. Thanks @lb0x` confirms the removal of the vulnerable component.
The files removed in the commit related to this issue are the webconsole files:
- includes/webconsole.php
