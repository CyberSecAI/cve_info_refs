[Version 3.2.0](/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/releases/tag/3.2.0)

RaspAP's front-end gets a complete overhaul by upgrading to the latest versions of Bootstrap (v5.3.3), the SB Admin theme (v7.0.7) and Font Awesome library (v6.6). Also included is a refactored and vastly superior dark mode switch, thanks in large part to Bootstrap 5.x's improved support for CSS variables. If you encounter any UI strangeness after upgrading, be sure to clear your browser cache.

## What's Changed

* Upgrade Bootstrap to v5.3.3 by [@billz](https://github.com/billz) in [#1682](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-webgui/pull/1682)
