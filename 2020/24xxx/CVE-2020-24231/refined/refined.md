- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SymmetricDS uses mx4j to provide access to JMX over HTTP. mx4j, by default, has no authentication and is available on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to JMX interface
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can interact with JMX: get system information, invoke MBean methods, and install additional MBeans from a remote host using MLet, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the exposed JMX interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the server running SymmetricDS.
