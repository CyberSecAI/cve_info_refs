| Summary | 0004263: mx4j without auth | | | | |
| Description | Symmetric DS uses mx4j to provide access to JMX over http. mx4j, by default, has no auth and available on all interfaces (0.0.0.0). Therefore, an attacker can interact with JMX: get system info, invoke MBean methods. Moreover, it's possible to install additional MBeans from a remote host using MLet that leads to arbitrary code execution. | | | | |
| Tags | No tags attached. | | | | |

We haven't participated in CVE requests before, so that is up to you. I can bring up the topic with the team, and maybe it's something we start doing in future. |
