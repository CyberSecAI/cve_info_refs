Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24563:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Trend Micro Apex One Security Agent.
- The core issue is that the software allows authentication to be bypassed by using a modified client that skips the authentication check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication enforcement in the Apex One Security Agent, allowing a modified client to bypass authentication procedures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker can ultimately execute code in the context of SYSTEM, which is the highest privilege level in Windows.
- **Full System Compromise:** By gaining SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can have full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must already have the ability to execute code with low privileges on the system where Apex One is installed.
- **Modified Client:** The attacker needs to use or create a modified version of the Apex One client that omits the authentication check.

**Summary:**
This CVE describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Trend Micro Apex One Security Agent that allows a local attacker with low-privilege code execution to escalate to SYSTEM level. By modifying the client, an attacker bypasses the authentication checks to gain full control of the system.
