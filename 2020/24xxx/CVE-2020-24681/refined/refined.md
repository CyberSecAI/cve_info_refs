- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission assignments for the Windows services `BrDiskImageSvcx` and `PviManSvcx` installed by B&R Automation Studio and PVI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient permission assignments on the mentioned services.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local attacker can alter the service configurations, leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges. This affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire Windows operating system and its data.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with an authenticated session on the system can modify the service configurations. The services in question are manually started.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access with a valid user account on the machine where B&R Automation Studio and PVI are installed.
