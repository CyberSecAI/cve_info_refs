Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-24215:

**Root Cause:**

*   A hardcoded backdoor password exists in the authentication function of the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application contains the hardcoded username `admin` and password `neworange88888888`, which bypasses the standard authentication process.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This hardcoded credential allows an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device, bypassing the intended login mechanisms (digest authentication, basic authentication, user/pass parameters).
*   **Insecure Code:** The authentication function checks the provided password against the hardcoded value before checking against user-defined settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation of the backdoor grants an attacker complete control over the device's web interface. This allows them to modify settings, configure the device, and potentially perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited through simple HTTP requests by providing the hardcoded credentials via basic authentication or as user/pass query parameters.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable as it affects the web interface of the devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device's web interface.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to know the device's configured administrator password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `box_Authenticate()` function performs checks against the hardcoded password before comparing it to the stored user password, making this backdoor easily accessible.
*   The provided blog post gives a detailed explanation on how the author discovered this hardcoded password by reverse engineering the application's binary.
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple vendor implementations, as they appear to use the same underlying application.
