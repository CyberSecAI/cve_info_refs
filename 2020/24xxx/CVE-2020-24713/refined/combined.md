# usd-2020-0053 | Gophish v0.10.1

**Advisory ID**: usd-2020-0053
**CVE Number**: CVE-2020-24713
**Affected Product**: Gophish
**Affected Version**: v0.10.1
**Vulnerability Type**: Insufficient Session Expiration
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://getgophish.com/>
**Vendor Status**: Fix scheduled

###

### Description

The client’s session cookie “gophish” doesn’t get invalidated on the server side upon logout. A new cookie is sent to the client however the old session cookie can be used for browsing the settings page and to retrieve the API key.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

A user’s session is not invalidated on the server-side upon logout. Hence, it is possible to continue browsing pages using the old session and a web application proxy such as Burp. The following screenshot illustrates how an HTTP request containing a logged out session returns the same response as if the session’s owner was still logged in.

1. Logout using /logout
2. Replay previously captured request to `/settings` (including old cookie) – observe that the session was not invalidated server-side

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200053-2.png "usd20200053-2")
### Fix

Upon logout, user sessions should be terminated both client and server side.

* 2020-06-22 Vendor responds to initial contact
* 2020-08-20 Vendor accepts the risk of publication while waiting for the underlying authentication library to fix the issue
* 2020-09-29 Security advisory released
