Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24713
**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient Session Expiration
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The Gophish application does not invalidate the session cookie ("gophish") on the server side when a user logs out. Although a new cookie is sent to the client upon logout, the old session cookie remains valid on the server.
**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use an old session cookie to bypass authentication, allowing them to:
    - Browse the settings page.
    - Retrieve the API key.
**Attack Vectors:**
    - Capture the "gophish" session cookie while a user is logged in.
    - User logs out
    - Replay captured requests (e.g., to the `/settings` page) with the old session cookie. This can be done using a web application proxy like Burp.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Ability to intercept or otherwise obtain a valid "gophish" session cookie.
    - Ability to replay HTTP requests with a modified cookie.
    - No specific user privileges needed other than the ability to access a valid user's session.

**Additional Details:**
  - The advisory was released by usd HeroLab, and the vulnerability was found by Marcus Nilsson of usd AG.
  - The vendor (Gophish) was notified and acknowledged the vulnerability and was planning a fix while waiting for the underlying authentication library to be updated.
