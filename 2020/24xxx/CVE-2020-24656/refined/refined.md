Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure processing of XML files by Maltego. Specifically, it is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs because Maltego parses XML files and allows the inclusion of external entities, which can then be used to read local files on a victim's system or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious XML external entities into MTZ (configuration) and MTGL (graph) files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Maltego does not properly validate or sanitize external entities defined within the XML files, allowing the attacker to control where the application fetches external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to read local files on the victim's computer (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/subuid`).
*   **SSRF:** In specific network configurations, attackers could potentially leverage SSRF to achieve code execution on the victim's machine, or other systems on the same network.
*  **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly detailed, the article mentions that XXE vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious MTZ/MTGL Files:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious MTZ or MTGL files containing the malicious external entity definitions. The attacker would then need to convince the victim to open these files with Maltego.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the knowledge to create specially crafted MTZ or MTGL files with malicious XML payloads.
*   **Social Engineering/File Delivery:** The attacker must be able to convince the victim to open the malicious file within their instance of Maltego.

**Technical Details:**
The provided technical details give a breakdown of the exploit, showing:
*   MTZ and MTGL files are ZIP archives containing XML and property files.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying an entity within an XML file inside the archive to include the malicious XXE payload.
*   The payload can use different URI protocols, such as `file:///` to read local system files.
*   The article explains that a malicious entity is created to fetch external content from a URL, that external content then specifies a local file to read, and finally a request is made to the attacker's server that includes the local file content in a query string.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Maltego versions 4.2.11 and below.
*   Maltego version 4.2.12 has addressed and patched this vulnerability.
