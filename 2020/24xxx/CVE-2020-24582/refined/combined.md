# Zulip Desktop 5.4.3 security release

  [![](/_astro/anders.C7YvkPz3_2eFAUl.webp)](author/anders/)  [Anders Kaseorg](author/anders/)   Sep 10, 2020 • 1 min read

Today we released Zulip Desktop 5.4.3, fixing a security issue:

* CVE-2020-24582: Zulip Desktop failed to escape various strings interpolated
  into the user interface HTML. This could result in code execution when
  connecting to a maliciously altered Zulip server.

The Zulip security team discovered this issue during internal auditing. Zulip
Desktop versions 5.4.2 and earlier are affected.

This release also includes the following changes since 5.4.2:

* Upstream dependencies have been upgraded to the latest compatible releases,
  including Electron 9.3.0.

## Upgrading

All installations should upgrade to this latest release as soon as possible.
Installations with the default automatic upgrades enabled will be upgraded to
the new release when next launched.
