Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24361:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from two main issues within the SNMP Trap Translator (SNMPTT):
    - Improper privilege dropping: SNMPTT fails to drop privileges as intended, leading to execution of commands with higher than expected permissions.
    - Inadequate command escaping: Certain functions within SNMPTT do not properly escape shell commands, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The lack of proper escaping in shell commands allows attackers to inject arbitrary shell code.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Due to the failure to drop privileges, malicious commands can be executed with elevated permissions, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running SNMPTT, effectively gaining control over the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service, rendering the SNMPTT service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** Attackers send specially crafted malicious SNMP traps to the vulnerable SNMPTT instance via the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running the vulnerable SNMPTT instance.
- **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs an understanding of SNMP traps to craft malicious ones.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of `snmptt` prior to 1.4.1.
- The fix is implemented in version 1.4.1 where shell commands are now properly escaped, and the privilege dropping mechanism is fixed.
- The issue is present in the `EXEC`, `PREEXEC` and `unknown_trap_exec` features of `snmptt`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The gentoo security advisory GLSA 202007-63 addresses this vulnerability
