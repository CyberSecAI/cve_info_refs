Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24411

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of PDF files by Adobe Illustrator.
- The core issue stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This inadequate validation allows for a write operation to occur past the end of an allocated memory structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds write, where data is written beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user/process. This means an attacker can run malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file that, when parsed by Adobe Illustrator, triggers the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PDF file that exploits the parsing vulnerability.
- The attacker must get the user to open this malicious PDF file. No specific user privileges are required. The attack can be triggered by a regular user account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Adobe.
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Illustrator 2020 version 24.2 and earlier on Windows.
- Adobe released version 25.0 of Illustrator to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tran Van Khang - khangkito of VinCSS (Member of Vingroup), working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
