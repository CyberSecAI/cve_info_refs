Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of user-controlled data (`$_POST['pagename']`) to construct a file path which is then passed to `file_get_contents()`. Specifically, the application reads the `pagename` parameter from POST data, stores it in a session, then in a global variable, and finally uses this value as the argument for `file_get_contents()`. This allows an attacker to control the URL/path passed to `file_get_contents()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF due to the insecure use of `file_get_contents()` with user-provided input.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `pagename` parameter, allowing arbitrary URLs and potentially other file paths to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Reading:** An attacker can potentially read the content of arbitrary files on the server's filesystem (if a local file path is supplied).
*   **Internal Network Scanning:** The attacker can use the server to probe internal network resources (by providing an internal IP address or host name), potentially revealing internal services or vulnerabilities.
*  **Access Internal Services:** By using protocols like `gopher://`, an attacker can interact with internal services such as Redis, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious value for the `pagename` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint (likely an entry point that includes `wcms/wex/html.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication, as the vulnerability is present in an unauthenticated part of the application flow.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided example code demonstrates how a malicious URL (`ftp://127.0.0.1:8000`) can be used to trigger the SSRF vulnerability with `file_get_contents()`.
*   The issue report suggests using the OWASP SSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet to mitigate the vulnerability, indicating the need for sanitization, validation, and URL whitelisting/blacklisting to avoid making external requests to internal services or arbitrary files.
