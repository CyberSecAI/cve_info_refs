The provided content includes two GitHub pages. The first one shows a commit to the `eonweb` repository, specifically commit `c416b52d3b500d96ab40875f95b7c7939628854b`, which contains a fix related to protecting login/logout logs recording. The second page shows the release notes for `5.3-7` of `eonweb`, which includes "fix protect login/logout logs recording" as one of the fixes.

Based on this, the commit `c416b52d3b500d96ab40875f95b7c7939628854b` addresses the vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability information extracted:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The logging mechanism in `include/function.php` was not properly sanitizing user input before writing it to the database. Specifically, the `$_COOKIE['user_name']` was being inserted into the logs table without sanitization via `htmlspecialchars()` if the `$user` variable was not explicitly set when the `logging()` function was called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization of `$_COOKIE['user_name']` before insertion into the database via a SQL query allows for a potential SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code by crafting a malicious `user_name` cookie value. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted `user_name` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set cookies for the domain associated with `eonweb` in the user's browser and initiate an action that invokes the `logging()` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit `c416b52d3b500d96ab40875f95b7c7939628854b` introduced `htmlspecialchars()` to the `$_COOKIE['user_name']` before its insertion to the database when `$user` is not explicitly passed to the `logging()` function. This commit fixes the SQL injection vulnerability.
