- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `calculate_operand_data_length` function within `dnn_execute_layer_pad` leads to an undersized destination buffer being allocated for a memcpy operation. This allows an attacker to control the source and destination buffer addresses inside memcpy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow. The integer overflow leads to a smaller buffer being allocated than required for the copy operation. This results in a memory corruption due to a write out of bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution due to the ability to control the addresses of the source and destination buffers in the memcpy.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input using the `dnn_backend=native` filter and a specific model (`crash_dnn_execute_layer_pad_3`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control over the `ffmpeg` command line options and be able to supply a specially crafted input file and model to trigger the vulnerability.
