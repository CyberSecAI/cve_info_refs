Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from debug messages containing addresses of memory transactions within the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) in some 10th Generation Intel Core Processors. These debug messages, if accessible to a privileged user, can potentially lead to information disclosure.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is the presence of sensitive memory address information in debug messages which should not be exposed to privileged users. This violates the principle of least privilege and constitutes an information leak.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to information disclosure. This could involve sensitive data stored or processed within the SGX enclave.

* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. A privileged user on the system, potentially an attacker with root or admin access, can access the debug messages.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be a privileged user on the system where the affected processor is being used. User interaction is also required, implying that the user must trigger the vulnerability indirectly, e.g. by running an application that emits the debug messages.

This document provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically about the nature of the debug message, the type of information leaked, and the specific 10th generation Intel Core processors that are affected.
