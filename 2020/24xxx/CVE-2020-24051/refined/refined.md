The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in Moog EXO series cameras. While it doesn't specify a CVE ID for each vulnerability, it does provide detailed information about them. Since the provided CVE ID is a placeholder, the content is still relevant as it describes vulnerabilities in a product.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **ONVIF Web Service Authentication Bypass:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms in the ONVIF web service.
*   **Undocumented Hardcoded Credentials:** The device contains hardcoded credentials that can be used to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Multiple Instances of Unauthenticated XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** The device is vulnerable to XXE attacks which can be exploited without authentication.
*   **`statusbroadcast` Arbitrary Command Execution as root:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges using the `statusbroadcast` functionality.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause for the ONVIF bypass is likely due to flaws in the authentication logic.
*   Hardcoded credentials stem from insecure development practices.
*   The XXE vulnerabilities arise from insecure XML parsing.
*   The `statusbroadcast` vulnerability is due to insecure handling of user input leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **ONVIF Bypass:** Allows attackers unauthorized access to camera functionality via the ONVIF protocol, potentially granting control over the camera.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Enables attackers to gain administrative access to the device via the exposed services.
*   **XXE:** Attackers can potentially read local files, perform denial of service, or execute arbitrary code if the server is configured for processing of external entities.
*  **`statusbroadcast` Arbitrary Command Execution as root:** This allows for complete system compromise, allowing attackers to take full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **ONVIF Bypass:** Exploitation via network access to the ONVIF service.
*  **Hardcoded Credentials:** Exploitation through exposed network services like web interface, telnet or ssh.
*   **XXE:** Exploitation via network access and sending malicious XML payloads to vulnerable endpoints.
*   **`statusbroadcast`:** Exploitation via network access to the `statusbroadcast` functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need network access to the Moog EXO series camera to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   No authentication is required for the XXE and command execution through the `statusbroadcast` vulnerabilities.
*   For ONVIF bypass, knowledge of the service and its vulnerabilities is needed.
*   For hardcoded credentials, the attacker must know these credentials (possibly found through other means).
