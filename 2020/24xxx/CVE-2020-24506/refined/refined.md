Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-24506:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in a subsystem within the Intel Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability stems from an attempt to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Improper input validation:** The advisory mentions that it's caused by an out of bounds read, suggesting insufficient checks of the input data that leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer.
- The affected component is the Intel CSME

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the system's memory.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to modify data or cause a denial-of-service condition according to CVSS vector.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker requires high privileges on the system to trigger the vulnerability.
