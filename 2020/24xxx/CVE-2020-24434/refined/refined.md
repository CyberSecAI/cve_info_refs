Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when exporting PDF files. Specifically, the application doesn't properly check the data, leading to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Out-of-bounds read: The core issue is reading memory outside of the intended buffer or object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially read sensitive data from memory, though this is limited to the context of the current process and requires chaining with other vulnerabilities to gain code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Malicious PDF File:  An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when processed by the vulnerable application during export, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   Malicious Page:  The vulnerability can also be triggered by the target visiting a malicious page, though the details of this attack vector are not provided in the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF to a target who will then use the vulnerable application to export it.
*   User Interaction: The user needs to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page in order for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in a security update from Adobe.
* The advisory identifies the researcher "kimiya" as the discoverer of the vulnerability.
