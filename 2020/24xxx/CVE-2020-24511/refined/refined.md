Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-24511:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper isolation of shared resources in some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient isolation of shared resources within the Intel processor's architecture. This allows for unintended data access between different security domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting it's not directly exploitable over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   The attacker requires local access to the affected system.
*   The attacker must be able to execute code on the targeted system.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a transient execution vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 5.6 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating it requires high attack complexity and has an impact on confidentiality.
*   Specific affected products include:
    *   NetApp FAS/AFF BIOS (only AFF A400/FAS8300/FAS8700)
    *   Multiple Siemens Industrial products, which are vulnerable if not updated to the required BIOS version.
    *   Intel Processors (specific models not listed, refer to Intel's provided links).
*   Mitigation is primarily done via firmware updates, which can be obtained from the respective vendors (NetApp, Siemens, or the system manufacturer for Intel processors).
*   Debian has addressed this vulnerability with an update to the `intel-microcode` package.
*   The Intel advisory lists Joseph Nuzman as the reporter of this vulnerability.
