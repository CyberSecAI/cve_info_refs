- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A double-free vulnerability exists within the GSS-TSIG implementation of PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a double-free, which can lead to a crash or potential arbitrary code execution. This is triggered within the handling of GSS-TSIG signatures.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to a denial of service via a crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the double-free is exploited further.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted DNS queries containing a GSS-TSIG signature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted queries. The attacker does not need any prior access or knowledge other than the ability to send DNS queries to the vulnerable server. The server needs to be compiled with `--enable-experimental-gss-tsig` for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
