The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Discourse.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Discourse application's email sending functionality, specifically when a user chooses to upload images from a website.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- Lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided URLs when fetching images for email content. This allows an attacker to input arbitrary URLs.
- The application makes a server-side request to the provided URL to retrieve the image.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the Discourse server to make requests to internal or external resources that it would not normally access. This can include:
    - Accessing internal services or resources within the network that the Discourse server resides in (e.g., internal databases, APIs).
    - Scanning internal networks by sending requests to various IP addresses and ports.
    - Reading sensitive information from other internal services.
    - Performing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on internal services.
    - Potentially exfiltrating data from the internal network to an external server controlled by the attacker, if an external URL is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts an email with an image that is to be uploaded from a user-provided URL.
- The attacker provides a URL to a malicious resource. This could be an internal service, a localhost address, or a server controlled by the attacker.
- When the Discourse server sends the email, it will make an HTTP request to the provided URL, thus triggering the SSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the Discourse platform with the ability to create emails and upload images from URLs.
- No other special access or position on the network is required.
