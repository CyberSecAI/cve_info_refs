Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24063

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in the `download.php` file of the Canto WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `subdomain` parameter within this file is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows an attacker to control the URL from which the server fetches data. This bypasses security measures and potentially grants access to internal or external resources.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly validate or sanitize the `subdomain` parameter in `download.php`, allowing for the injection of malicious URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary URL Request:** An attacker can make the server send requests to any URL they specify.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve content from internal or external servers that the WordPress server can reach.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By making the server fetch a page with an XSS payload, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the WordPress site when viewed.
- **Cross-Site Port Attack:** Potentially scan open ports on internal servers.
- **Abuse of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Potentially bypass CORS restrictions to fetch data.
- **Access to Internal Resources:** Could lead to access of internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible if the WordPress server has access to them

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** By crafting a malicious URL and injecting it into the `subdomain` parameter of `download.php`.
- **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- No special privileges or prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `wp-content/plugins/canto/includes/lib/download.php`.
