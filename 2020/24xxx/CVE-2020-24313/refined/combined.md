## Description

[Ultimate Appointment Scheduling Demo](https://www.etoilewebdesign.com/ultimate-appointment-scheduling-demo/)

Appointment booking platform that lets your customers schedule appointments directly on your website with an easy-to-use calendar and booking form. Set up locations, services, and providers for those services, and let your clients start booking their appointment reservations online today!

**Includes Gutenberg block for displaying appointment booking forms!**

#### Key Appointment Booking Features

* Create appointment locations with different opening hours
* Create appointment services that cost different amounts and take different amounts of time
* Dynamically updated booking calendar and appointment schedules, so it’s impossible to double book
* Optional multi-step booking form
* Set required information, such as name or phone number
* Set up automated reminder emails that will go out to your clients a certain number of days or hours before their appointments

Great for businesses that need to set up one-on-one or one-to-many services, such as mechanics, medical professionals, event venues, exercise classes, corporate training sessions, etc. Also works to schedule meetings, for scheduling phone calls and for other situations in which a booking form and reservation system are required.

**Appointment Booking Form**

Adding your booking form to a page is as simple as inserting the above shortcode. You can search for it by name or find it in the **Ultimate Appointment Scheduling** block section. With the block, you can also insert your booking form into any widget area in your theme. Ultimate appointment booking flexibility!

```
[ultimate-appointment-calendar]
[ultimate-appointment-dropdown]

```

Alternatively, you can simply insert either of the appointment booking shortcodes above into any page to display a responsive booking form. The first will display a booking calendar, from which you can select and reserve an appointment time. The second will allow you choose a date and then display available appointment booking times that are available for you to book a reservation.

Allow your visitors and customers to book reservations for a wide array of services and appointment types. With options to create an unlimited amount of unique appointment services, to specify multiple different appointment locations, and to create service providers and specify the services they do, the booking locations they work at and their hours, all with an easy-to-use reservation form on the front end, Ultimate Appointment Scheduling provides the most simple and effecting booking solution and reservation system that is perfect for both you the admin as well as your site visitors.

#### Email Notifications and Reminders

The plugin comes with a flexible array of email notification and reminder options. You can configure it to automatically send a notification to the admin and to the customer when a new booking is made.

You can create an unlimited number of custom email messages, which you can assign to your different notifications.

You can also create an unlimited number of reservations reminder notifications, which will allow you to send out emails to your customers at the exact time intervals you need, to help remind them of their upcoming appointments.

Notification and email features include:

* Send an automatic email to the admin when a new booking is made
* Send automatic emails to clients when a reservation is placed and an appointment is successfully created
* Create unique email messages that you can assign to your different notifications.
* Set up automated reminder emails that will go out to your clients a certain number of days or hours before their appointments

#### Additional Appointment Reservation Features

Ultimate Appointment Scheduling comes with many more features that make it the most advanced and versatile booking form solution for accepting reservations on your WordPress site, including options to make your appointment services, locations and providers as specific or broad as you require, and a mobile booking form for the ultimate responsive reservation system.

* Options to set a minimum and maximum number of days before an appointment that a reservation for a service can be booked
* Set the amount of time between appointments. This, combined with the duration set for a service, will decide when appointment reservations can made.
* Set the date format and hours format
* Set a calendar offset to specify how far ahead the default opening date of the calendar will be

#### Premium Appointment Features

The premium version of Ultimate Appointment Scheduling comes with even more features, which will allow you to customize the form both to your exact needs and to your website. Some of the great premium features are:

* Accept mandatory or optional payments for appointments either via PayPal or WooCommerce
* Add reCAPTACHA to your form, to help prevent spam
* Option to require login to WordPress before being able to create an appointment
* Additional booking form layout option
* Labelling options
* Customize the look of your form with an array of styling options to help you fit it in seamlessly with the rest of your site

## FAQ

### How do I get an appointment scheduler to show up on my page?

Try adding the shortcode [ultimate-appointment-dropdown] to whatever page you’d like to display it on.

### What are the current UASP shortcodes?

* [ultimate-appointment-dropdown]: display a set of dropdown menus to find appointment times and schedule an appointment
* [ultimate-appointment-calendar]: display a calendar-based booking form

### How do I add custom CSS?

In the plugin admin, please do the following:

* Click on Options and then choose the Basic area
* Write down your CSS code in the Custom CSS text area
* Click “Save Changes” to save your changes

### How do I add new fields to the booking form?

To create custom fields, you need to go to the Custom Fields tab and simply add a new field. Do not forgot to set their options (slug, type and input values) properly in order to prevent confusion.

### Can I redirect to another page after the booking form is submitted?

You can do this in the shortcode. For example: [ultimate-appointment-dropdown redirect\_page=”http://google.com/”]

### Can I limit booking to a certain number of days before the appointment

To do this, you can use the “Minimum Days in Advance” and “Maximum Days in Advance” settings in the “Basic” area of the “Options” tab.

### Can I send email reminders to people about their appointments?

You definitely can. First go to the “Emails” area of the “Options” tab and create your email. Then go to the “Reminders” area of the “Options” tab, create your reminder and choose the email you want to be sent out for the reminder.

Unfortunately the plugin is badly programmed and throws lots of exceptions when you start to debug. I bought the plugin and immediately encountered multiple problems:
– after the years, there is still no documentation
– appointments form works without selecting a date… support had access to staging enviroment, destroied this completely and then said the database must be corrupt and I have to install WordPress again… this is strange as all other plugins work perfectly, even the new appointment plugin, which I installed afterwards and even is free with great support !
– appointments import does not work, support sent template but this did not work either, then no more response from support
– appointment start times are not removed even if time has already gone by, it is not a time zone settings problem on my side, as the new plugin works without a problem
There would be many more to mention. Sadly I bought the plugin and wasted over a month trying to fix and improve things with it, until I finally gave up.

There is NOTHING on the product page to indicate that there’s a Premium version of the plugin.
As soon as you install it you’re BOMBARDED with crap begging you to buy their Premium version. I mean even worse than Yoast does (and that’s saying a LOT).
The basic free version is pretty much useless. Typical bait and switch crap plugin.
Save your time and find another solution. I’m off to do that right now myself and I’ll have no problem PAYING for a solution – as long as they don’t try to hide what they’re really trying to do.

A very good plugin. It has some really good features as standard such as acknowledging appointments, holidays and keeping a log of the appointments – albeit in the WordPress environment itself. It’s worth getting the extra features that come with the full version though.
Overall, very easy to use and implement. Also very flexible at the same time. The only criticism I have would be that aligning the services and service providers are a bit fiddly at first. Otherwise, all good.
