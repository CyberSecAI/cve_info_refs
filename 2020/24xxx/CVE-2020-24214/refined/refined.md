  "response": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `box_rtspParseParam()` function when handling the `CSeq` parameter in RTSP requests due to insufficient bounds checking. The `sprintf` function copies the user-provided `CSeq` value into a fixed-size stack buffer, which can overflow if the `CSeq` value is too large.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to application crash. Potential for remote code execution (RCE) depending on the ability to control program flow by overwriting the return address on the stack; however, this is unlikely due to ASLR.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a specially crafted RTSP request with an overly large `CSeq` value to the vulnerable device.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the RTSP port of the affected device. No authentication is required."
