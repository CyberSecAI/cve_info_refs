Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24567:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content directly references CVE-2020-24567 and provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability. The CVE description talks about a vulnerability in voidtools' Everything service for Windows. The content confirms it is related to DLL hijacking in the Everything service.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Everything service attempts to load the `urlmon.dll` library from its installation directory before searching in `C:\Windows\System32`. This is a classic case of a DLL hijacking vulnerability, where a malicious DLL can be placed in the application's directory to be loaded instead of the legitimate one.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The primary weakness is the application's vulnerable DLL loading procedure, where it prioritizes loading DLLs from its install directory instead of system paths first, without proper validation.
*   **Unsigned DLL Load:** The service loads `urlmon.dll` which may not be a signed DLL from the application's directory which may be under user control.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges by placing a malicious `urlmon.dll` in the Everything install directory. This is because the Everything service runs with `SYSTEM` privileges and will load and execute the malicious DLL.
*   **Persistence:**  The malicious code will be executed every time the Everything service starts. This provides a mechanism for persistent code execution, allowing the attacker to maintain control over the system.
*   **Whitelist Bypass:** Because the Everything service executable is signed, an attacker can bypass security software that uses whitelisting of signed executables. The malicious DLL runs in the context of the signed service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Write Access:** An attacker needs write access to the Everything installation directory, which may be a low privilege directory.
*   **DLL Replacement:** The attacker replaces the legitimate `urlmon.dll` with a malicious version.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker only needs to be a low privilege user that is able to write files in the install directory of Everything.
*   **File system access:** The attacker needs file system access to the target machine.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

*   The Everything service, which runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, attempts to load `urlmon.dll` from its own installation directory before the system directory.
*   An attacker can create a malicious `urlmon.dll` and place it in the Everything install directory.
*   When the service starts, it will load the malicious DLL, granting the attacker code execution with system privileges.
*   The provided exploit forwards all calls to the original `urlmon.dll` to ensure there are no errors in the target program.
* The attacker's code execution persists across reboots.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in Everything version 1.4.1.990, prior versions are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Cymaera.
*   The forum content provides version information and patch history for Everything.
