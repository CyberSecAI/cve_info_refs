```
We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of IXP Manager
v5.7.0.

This release primarily fixes a XSS security issue in IXP Manager. It
also has a small number of bug fixes and improvements. All IX's running
< v5.7.0 are advised to upgrade. This release has a minor version bump
as there are two small database schema changes.

Full details are:

<https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/releases/tag/v5.7.0>

**Security Fix**

This release includes a fix for a XSS security bug in the looking glass
feature. The bug allows a potential attacker to provide an IXP Manager
user or administrator a crafted URL which would result in the execution
of supplied JavaScript within the user's browser.

Credit to Bart Vrancken (AbuseIO CERT) for responsibly disclosing this
issue.

# Upgrade Instructions

Please follow [the official upgrade documentation](https://docs.ixpmanager.org/install/upgrading/) without skipping any steps.

There are no additional release specific steps required.

# Security Fix

This release includes a fix for [a XSS security bug](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) in the looking glass feature.

The bug allows a potential attacker to provide an IXP Manager user or administrator a crafted URL which would result in the execution of supplied JavaScript within the user's browser.

If you are running IXP Manager with the looking glass feature enabled, **you are advised to upgrade**. If you wish to delay the upgrade and mitigate the risk in the mean time then you could:

1. set the looking glass access privileges to *SUPERUSER* in each of your router configurations;
2. advise your *SUPERADMINS* to examine any externally provided IXP Manager URL for the presence of potential XSS code.

# Small Features and Improvements

* New Artisan command to reindex switch ports' ifIndex based on ifName. This is useful when a port's ifIndex changes in a switch operating system update. See [this documentation](https://docs.ixpmanager.org/usage/switches/#matching-database-ports-to-switch-ports) for more information.
  + And suplemantal to this, we can now also exclude a switch from polling (via [00ccf4d](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/00ccf4dda21d8cbea2c038880dcd58f1b138eebf)).
* **IX-F Member Export:** improvements include: ([7286616](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/7286616f41cfc0e0566830d76a5cff5b97ba8180))
  + Provides a more user friendly error message if the schema-required IX-F IXP ID is not set.
  + Allows the poller to provide an IX-F ID per infrastructure if one is not set via the parameter: `&ixfid_1=xx&ixfid_2=yy`.
  + Allows the poller to ignore the missing IX-F ID and set it to zero via the parameter: `?ignore_missing_ixfid=1`.
  + Tag IXP Manager as the generator of the IX-F JSON document ([4185fe6](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/4185fe6ad25c739fbab6050659979476b0a223e0))
* Better member logo layouts ([c10c712](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/c10c712143d0f9f15c1695dc1db8326360faa8d6)) and option to add a background colour to check transparency ([8a0ce56](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/commit/8a0ce567851f0dbcf6526134f58fa2e143c54347))
