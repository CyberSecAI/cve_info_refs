```
{
  "CVE-2020-24379": {
    "Root cause": "The Yaws web server's WebDAV module uses the Xmerl Erlang library for parsing XML messages, which has unsafe defaults, leading to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of XML input",
      "Use of an XML parser with unsafe defaults"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to potentially read arbitrary files from the server, cause a denial of service, or perform other attacks depending on the system's configuration and permissions.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a specially crafted XML payload within a WebDAV request (specifically the LOCK, PROPFIND, or PROPPATCH methods) to the server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and have the ability to trigger WebDAV functionality, which requires that the `dav = true` setting is enabled in the server's configuration file."
  }
