Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability in Skype for macOS, which aligns with the CVE-2020-24003 description of a local code injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
   - Skype's entitlements, specifically `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation`, which allows the loading of unsigned shared libraries.
    - A modifiable dependency path to the `Electron Framework` library within the Skype application bundle. This dependency is a symbolic link which makes it writable for the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Entitlement Misuse:** The presence of the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement bypasses the Hardened Runtime protection, which is meant to prevent loading of unsigned libraries.
2.  **Writable Dependency Path:** The symbolic link that points to the  `Electron Framework` is modifiable by the user, allowing an attacker to redirect it to a malicious library.
3.  **Unsigned Library Loading:** The ability to load an unsigned library allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the Skype process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:**  Attackers can inject malicious code into the Skype process by replacing the legitimate `Electron Framework` library with a malicious one.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected code can execute with the same privileges as the Skype application, which has entitlements to access the camera, microphone and location services.
*   **Interception of Video/Audio:** Attackers can intercept video conferences and record audio/video without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   **Silent Proxy for Recording:** Skype can be used as a silent proxy to record video and sound if the user has previously authorized access to the microphone and camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the user's machine.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the symbolic link for the `Electron Framework` library, replacing it with their own malicious library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the target macOS system.
*   **File System Write Access:** They must have write access to the Skype application bundle to modify the symbolic link within the  `Contents/Frameworks/` directory.
*   **Basic understanding of macOS libraries and linking**
