Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a weak token expiration mechanism in ForLogic Qualiex versions 1 and 3. This means that the authorization tokens used to access the application do not expire properly or have excessively long expiration periods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak Token Expiration:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper expiration for authorization tokens. This allows attackers to potentially reuse tokens for extended periods.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** This weakness stems from the ability to reuse tokens, effectively bypassing access controls meant to protect the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can use a valid token to escalate their privileges within the application.
- **Information Disclosure:** Due to the improper access control, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Qualiex system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Token Reuse:** The vulnerability is exploited by an attacker intercepting or obtaining a valid authorization token and reusing it to gain access, even after the legitimate user's session should have expired.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely, without requiring physical access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Qualiex application.
- **Token Acquisition:** An attacker must be able to obtain a valid authorization token. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
  - Interception during a legitimate user's session.
  - Compromising a user's account.
  - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to obtain a token.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without initial authentication, as once a token is obtained, it can be reused without needing valid credentials.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at UnderProtection.
- The vendor, ForLogic, was notified of the vulnerability and collaborated on a coordinated disclosure.
- The provided content also mentions that other versions of Qualiex may be affected, especially within the same product family, but this has not been confirmed.
