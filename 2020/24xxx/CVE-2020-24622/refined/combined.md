## Where did issues.sonatype.org go?[âï¸](#where-did-issuessonatypeorg-go "Permanent link")

I typed issues.sonatype.org in my browser, and the link redirected me here.
What happened to the previous issues.sonatype.org?

---

On Jan 9th, 2024 [we announced](../../news/20240109_issues_sonatype_org_deprecation/) issues.sonatype.org
will be decommissioned soon. As part of the decommissioning process we removed the access to issues.sonatype.org,
and we replaced our Jira ticketing system with a Zendesk email intake method. To open a support ticket
with us email Central Support and follow-up in the email thread. To help us get back to you faster,
please do not include previous replies in your follow-up messages.

## I used to register/update my OSSRH account at issues.sonatype.org, what do I do now?[âï¸](#i-used-to-registerupdate-my-ossrh-account-at-issuessonatypeorg-what-do-i-do-now "Permanent link")

I used to fill a form at issues.sonatype.org every time I registered a new account or if I wanted
to make changes. What is the process now ?

---

To register to publish to Maven Central, please follow the instructions in our
[Central Portal registration documentation](../../register/central-portal/).

Legacy OSSRH Service

There are still many third-party articles on how to publish to Maven Central
that have not been updated to reference the new flow. If you arrived here
because of a link to `issues.sonatype.org` in an article, it might refer to
OSSRH. Currently, we are only granting publisher access to OSSRH for users
for the following cases:

* Publishing via a workflow that is not yet supported by the Central Publisher Portal
* Requesting for a new user to be added to a namespace that is already publishing via OSSRH

If necessary, to register a new OSSRH account, please follow the instructions in
our [OSSRH registration documentation](../../register/legacy/).

To add a new publisher to an existing namespace, send us a support ticket at Central Support
and include the username(s) to be added. The username(s) must be already registered by following
the instructions in OSSRH registration page. Please make sure the email account where you submit
the support request from is registered in our system as a publisher for that namespace.
