Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24376:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `dev.freebox.fr_3533b37a_20250119_114531.html` explicitly mentions "CVE-2020-24376, DNS-rebinding in UPnP IGD" as one of the security issues fixed in the Freebox Server firmware update 4.2.3.  The content from `www.gabriel.urdhr.fr_0b117a2d_20250119_114532.html` also provides a detailed description of this vulnerability. Therefore, the provided content is directly related to CVE-2020-24376.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD) service (fbxigdd) of Freebox devices. This service does not properly validate the `Host` header in HTTP requests, making it susceptible to DNS rebinding attacks.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the `Host` header by the UPnP IGD service. This allows attackers to bypass access restrictions and interact with the service from external networks by using a DNS rebinding technique.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability using DNS rebinding. They first trick a user into visiting a malicious website. The website will then use a specially crafted DNS record that initially resolves to the attacker’s server and subsequently to the victim’s Freebox local IP address.  By manipulating DNS resolution, the attacker’s script within the user's browser is able to bypass the Same-Origin Policy and send requests to the UPnP service.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and have the victim visit that website.  The attacker does not need to be on the same local network as the victim. The attack relies on the victim's browser being on the same local network as the vulnerable Freebox device.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Port Forwarding:** The most direct impact is the ability for an attacker to forward a Wide Area Network (WAN) port to the device where the victim's browser is running on the local network. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to services running on the local device or use it as a pivot point for further attacks.
    *   **Control over Router:** The UPnP IGD service allows for control over several router functionalities, which opens the door to actions such as creating VPN tunnels, changing DNS resolvers, etc.

**3. Technical Details (from Gabriel's blog):**

*   The vulnerable UPnP IGD service listens on TCP port 5678.
*   The blog post includes a JavaScript code example demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability to forward a WAN port. This code uses a DNS rebinding technique with a domain that first points to an external IP and then to the local IP address of the Freebox.
*   It emphasizes that while an attacker can't use this specific vulnerability to directly forward a port to another device on the LAN, it enables them to attack the device on which the browser is running.
*   The exploit code uses SOAP requests to interact with the UPnP service.

**4. Resolution:**

The vulnerability was fixed in Freebox Server firmware version 4.2.3 and Freebox v5 modem firmware version 1.5.29 by implementing proper validation of the `Host` header.

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content provides more details than the typical CVE description, especially concerning the technical aspects of the attack (code example) and the impact.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Gabriel Corona.
*   The DNS rebinding technique leverages a special DNS service to dynamically switch the IP address associated with a domain name during an attack.

In summary, CVE-2020-24376 details a DNS rebinding vulnerability in the UPnP IGD service of Freebox devices. It allows an attacker to bypass network restrictions and forward ports, which could expose local devices to further attacks and compromise the router.
