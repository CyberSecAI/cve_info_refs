Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-24435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. It is triggered by a specific JavaScript code embedded within a PDF file when opened in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. The vulnerability is a reoccurrence of a previously patched vulnerability (TALOS-2020-1031).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). The application fails to properly validate the size of data being written to the heap, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information due to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploitation can cause memory corruption which can be leveraged to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file and distribute it to victims.
- **Malicious Web Page:** A user visiting a malicious web page could be tricked into triggering the vulnerability if the PDF is rendered using the browser plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs a way to get the victim to open the malicious PDF file or visit a webpage where the PDF is rendered. This can be accomplished through social engineering, email phishing, or embedding the PDF on a website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was rediscovered in a newer version of Adobe Acrobat Reader, despite being previously patched.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a form using embedded JavaScript code within a PDF, allowing precise memory manipulation.
- Adobe categorizes this as a critical vulnerability.
- The vulnerable version is Adobe Acrobat Reader DC version 2020.012.20043.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
