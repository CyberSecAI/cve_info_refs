Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled Search Path Element. This means the application is susceptible to loading and executing code from directories that are not explicitly intended for this purpose. This can occur when the application does not properly validate or restrict the locations it searches for executable files or libraries.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the lack of control over the search path, leading to a critical security issue.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This allows an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

*  **Attack vectors**: The attacker could potentially place a malicious executable or library in a location that is part of the application's search path. The application, upon starting or during operation, might then load and execute this malicious code without proper validation, leading to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have the ability to place a malicious file in a location that Lightroom Classic searches during its operation. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising a directory within the user's system or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain this access.

**Summary of CVE-2020-24447:**

The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element in Adobe Lightroom Classic, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious file in a location where the application searches for executables/libraries. This vulnerability is rated as critical.
