(For the stable branch, for the PaaS branch see [#500](https://github.com/PreMiD/PreMiD/pull/500).)

**Without this patch any website can get the Discord user information if the PreMiD desktop app is running**, as it leaves the locally hosted socketio web server (port 3020) open to all origins.

This patch implements a fix which is a function that tests the origin on each socket connection, it checks if the origin is `*` as Chrome extensions appear with that origin (`*`) so it limits it to only Chrome extensions. **There are most likely better fixes which would limit it to only the PreMiD extension and not all Chrome extensions but this is the best solution for now.**

**Please merge this (or make a similar fix) quickly as this is a serious problem as it allows any website to get the Discord user information of anyone currently running PreMiD.**

It has been successfully tested on:

* Chromium-based (Brave Nightly) - Linux (Arch)
* Firefox (Nightly) - Linux (Arch)
* Chrome - Windows
* Firefox - Windows

Without fix (user info is easily got):

With fix (it is blocked): [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19228318/86448510-c0334a00-bd0e-11ea-90c3-94a85ccc11c0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19228318/86448510-c0334a00-bd0e-11ea-90c3-94a85ccc11c0.png)
