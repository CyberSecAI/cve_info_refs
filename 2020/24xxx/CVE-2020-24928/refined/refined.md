Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24928:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The PreMiD desktop application's locally hosted socket.io web server (port 3020) was accessible from any origin due to a lack of proper CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. This means that any website could connect to this server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure CORS configuration:** The server did not properly validate the origin of incoming connections, allowing connections from any website, including malicious ones.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The socket.io server exposed sensitive user data, specifically Discord user information, to any connecting client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  A malicious website could connect to the vulnerable socket.io server and obtain the Discord user information of any user running the PreMiD desktop application. This could include sensitive information like user ID, username, discriminator, bot status, Nitro status, and flags.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attack:** Any website visited by a user running the vulnerable PreMiD application could initiate a connection to the exposed socket.io server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to have a web server serving a page that includes JavaScript code that connects to the vulnerable socket.io server running on the user's machine.
*   The victim must be running the vulnerable version of the PreMiD application and browse to the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions a patch that tests the origin of each connection and limits it to only chrome extensions. However, this was not the best solution and was later fully fixed, with the new application.
*   The provided content also contains a link to a demo of the exploit `https://cve-2020-24928.netlify.app`, as well as links to MITRE and NIST pages referencing the CVE.
*   The vulnerability was identified and patched in the PreMiD project.
