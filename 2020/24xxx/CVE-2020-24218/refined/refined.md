Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-24218:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the presence of hardcoded credentials in the firmware of the HiSilicon-based hardware video encoders, specifically, a hardcoded root password is set and copied to the system's password file. The telnet service is enabled by default and cannot be disabled through the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded root password:** The devices use a fixed password hash in the `/etc/passwd` file, which corresponds to `neworang`, `unisheen`, or `neworangetech` depending on the vendor.
*   **Enabled Telnet:** The telnet service is enabled by default and cannot be disabled via the admin web interface.
* **Password file copied during boot:** The `/etc/passwd` file is overwritten by the `run` script during boot, using the hardcoded credentials within the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full root access:** An attacker can gain full root access to the device via telnet using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Device compromise:** Gaining root access allows the attacker to fully control the device, execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the device, typically on port 23 (telnet).
*   **Telnet login:** The attacker uses the hardcoded username (`root`) and password to login via telnet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the target device or have network access to it.
*   **Knowledge of credentials:** The attacker needs knowledge of the hardcoded username ("root") and password ("neworang", "unisheen", or "neworangetech").
