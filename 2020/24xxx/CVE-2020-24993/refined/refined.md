Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it in web pages. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode potentially malicious HTML/JavaScript code entered by users, leading to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts are injected into the database/system and are executed when a user (or in some cases any visitor) views the affected pages.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly sanitize user input, especially when handling URLs and form titles, allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser.
*   **Session hijacking/cookie theft:** An attacker can potentially steal user session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Defacement or manipulation of content:** An attacker could modify the content of the website, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Privilege escalation:** In some cases, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges or gain access to administrative functionalities by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Triggering actions on behalf of the user:** An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user, e.g., posting comments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Question supplement link field:** An attacker can inject a malicious script via the link field in the question supplement function.
*   **Online submission title field:** An attacker can inject a malicious script via the title field of the online submission module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to interact with the application:** An attacker must be able to access and interact with the vulnerable input fields (question supplement and online submission modules).
*   **No prior authentication or admin access required:** The vulnerability in the question supplement is triggered when any visitor views the issue. While the second XSS needs admin approval of the submitted content before being triggered, it does not need the attacker to have admin privileges to inject.

**Specific details from the report:**

*   **First XSS:** The attacker inserts `"> < SVG / onload = alert ('xss') > <! --`  into the address item in the Question supplement function, triggering a stored XSS when any visitor views the issue.
*   **Second XSS:** The attacker inserts `<script>alert (1)</script>` into the title item of the online submission module. This XSS is triggered when an administrator opens the content management page after approving the submission.
