# Overview

Static sites are fast, secure, easy to deploy, and manageable using version
control.

Hakyll is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) library for generating static sites,
mostly aimed at small-to-medium sites and personal blogs. It is written in a
very configurable way and uses an [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)-like DSL for
configuration.

Integration with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) gives us markdown
and TeX support, including syntax highlighting and other goodies.

# Getting Started

You can get the latest version from hackage using `cabal install hakyll`, or
using [stack](http://www.haskellstack.org/) by using `stack install hakyll`. Then, you can:

* read the [tutorials](./tutorials.html);
* mail the [google discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/hakyll);
* ask questions on the IRC channel: `#hakyll` on
  [irc.libera.chat](https://libera.chat/) (we *do not* have a channel on
  Freenode anymore).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# USN-4569-1: Yaws vulnerabilities

5 October 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Yaws.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [yaws](/security/cves?package=yaws) - High performance HTTP 1.1 webserver written in Erlang

## Details

It was discovered that Yaws did not properly sanitize XML input. A remote

attacker could use this vulnerability to execute an XML External Entity

(XXE) injection attack. ([CVE-2020-24379](/security/CVE-2020-24379))

It was discovered that Yaws mishandled certain input when running CGI

scripts. A remote attacker could use this vulnerability to execute

arbitrary commands. ([CVE-2020-24916](/security/CVE-2020-24916))

This is Yaws, a webserver for dynamic content written in Erlang.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/erlyaws/yaws/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/erlyaws/yaws/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Yaws Web Page

The
[Yaws Web Page](https://erlyaws.github.io/) is available online with
documentation and examples.

## Yaws Mailing List

The
[erlyaws-list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/erlyaws-list)
is used to discuss Yaws. You might find the
[erlyaws-list archives](https://sourceforge.net/p/erlyaws/mailman/erlyaws-list/)
helpful.

## Prepare build

Get and install an Erlang system (<http://www.erlang.org>).

**To compile Yaws, Erlang/OTP 23.0 or higher is required.**

If you've cloned the source from github and you want to build using autotools,
note there is no ./configure script in the source, so create one:

```
$> autoreconf -fi

```

Install build dependencies. Required packages to compile Yaws are (based on
debian packages):

* build-essential
* autoconf/automake/libtool
* erlang - Required apps:
* erlang-{kernel/stdlib/sasl/erts}
* erlang-compiler
* erlang-crypto
* erlang-xmerl
* libpam0g-dev

To build the documentation (optional), you also need to install:

* texlive-latex-base
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-font-utils
* texlive-extra-utils
* ghostscript

On Ubuntu/debian this is pretty much equal to:

```
$> apt-get build-dep yaws

```

On MacOS and OS X, be sure the necessary Xcode command-line tools and
development environment are set up correctly by running the following
command:

```
xcode-select --install

```

Finally, to run the test suites, yaws need to install:

* git
* wget
* curl
* erlang-eunit
* erlang-inets
* erlang-mnesia
* erlang-ssl
* cadaver (optional)

## Build

You can build via autotools:

```
$> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

```

or via rebar3:

```
$> rebar3 compile

```

If using rebar3, you'll get a "local installation" that you can run
via `rebar3 shell`.

If using autotools, the build will be configured by default for installation
under /usr/local. For more information about installation directories and
other supported options, see the configure help. Useful options are:

```
--with-defaultcharset=CHARSET specify default charset, i.e UTF-8
--with-extrainclude=DIR       dir to include if e.g. pam is installed in some odd place
--with-erlang=PREFIX          prefix where Erlang is installed (optional)

```

Note to packagers (rpm, deb ...) All install targets support the DESTDIR
variable. Thus, if we do

```
$> ./configure --prefix=/usr; make

```

we can subsequently do:

```
$> make install DESTDIR=/foo/bar

```

All Yaws files will be installed under DESTDIR, but all code will assume Yaws
should be installed under /usr.

Main make targets:

* all : compile Yaws
* debug : compile Yaws with debug flags
* clean : remove files produced by all or debug target
* install : do a proper install of Yaws
* doc or docs : build the documentation
* check or test : launch tests
* cleantest : remove files produced by check target
* dialyzer : run dialyzer on Yaws
* mkinstaller : build an installer for windows
* cleaninstaller: remove files produced by mkinstaller target
* apps : compile Yaws applications (chat,mail,wiki,yapp)
* cleanapps : remove files produced by apps target
* installapps : install Yaws applications
* fullinstall : install + installapps
* fullclean : clean + cleantest + cleanapps + cleaninstaller

## Reproducible builds

It is possible to build deterministically, thus enabling reproducible builds
of Yaws.

A deterministic build is enabled either by running `configure` with options
`--enable-deterministic-build` and `--with-source-date-epoch`:

```
$> ./configure --enable-deterministic-build \
               --with-source-date-epoch=$known_unix_timestamp

```

or by setting the environment variables `YAWS_DETERMINISTIC_BUILD` and
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` before running `autoreconf` and `configure`,
respectively:

```
$> export YAWS_DETERMINISTIC_BUILD=true # set to any value will enable
%> autoreconf -fi
$> export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$known_unix_timestamp
$> ./configure

```

After either of the two configurations above are done, build as usual:

```
$> make all doc

```

The above configurations for enabling deterministic builds add the erlc flag
`+deterministic`, drop the `+debug_info` flag, generate a deterministic
`yaws_generated.beam`, and set e.g. creation date in `yaws.ps` and `yaws.pdf`
from the value of `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, which is expected to be an integer
reflecting a number of seconds since the Unix epoch. (One way to get an epoch
integer value is via the command `date '+%s'` on Linux or macOS, for example.
If you're using the bash shell version 4.2 or newer, `printf '%(%s)T\n' -1`
gives an epoch integer value, and starting at version 5, the bash shell
provides the `$EPOCHSECONDS` variable.)

Note that various paths in configuration files, templates, examples etc. are
generated from the configured installation prefix config files; thus they
will vary if the installation prefix is different across builds. This can be
mitigated by using DESTDIR when installing (see the Build section above for
more details).

## Test your build

With autotools, to test the build, you should install it somewhere:

```
$> ./configure --prefix=$PWD/_inst && make install
$> $PWD/_inst/bin/yaws -i

```

If you used rebar3 to build Yaws, you can alternatively start Yaws with

```
$> rebar3 shell

```

Either approach will start a webserver at <http://0.0.0.0:8000>
Terminate through ^C, or ^G followed by q, or

```
> init:stop()

```

*NOTE: If you've used rebar3 to build the system, none of the following
directions apply.*

## Install and run

NOTE: following commands may require root privileges, depending of the
installation prefix.

Just run:

```
$> make install

```

Then, to run Yaws, you should use its script:

```
$> ${bindir}/yaws -i

```

This starts an interactive system.

With the default yaws.conf file, this will create a webserver at
http://${host} and one at https://${host}.

You can adapt Yaws configuration by editing '${sysconfig}/yaws/yaws.conf'.

## Daemonize Yaws

Start it using '--daemon' and '--heart' options:

```
$> ${bindir}/yaws --daemon --heart

```

This will start a daemon (--daemon) which will be autorestarted when/if it
crashes or hangs (--heart).
Also, for most unices, we create proper start scripts in ${sysconfdir}/init.d

Example:

```
$> autoreconf -fi
$> ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
$> make && make install
$> /etc/init.d/yaws start

```

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : yaws
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-24379 CVE-2020-24916

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in yaws, a high performance HTTP 1.1
webserver written in Erlang.

CVE-2020-24379

    The WebDAV implementation is prone to a XML External Entity (XXE)
    injection vulnerability.

CVE-2020-24916

    The CGI implementation does not properly sanitize CGI requests
    allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands via
    specially crafted CGI executable names.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your yaws packages.

For the detailed security status of yaws please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/yaws>

# [XXE and OS command injections in Yaws](../../post/yaws-xxe-and-shell-injections/)

Yaws is a web server for dynamic-content web applications written in Erlang. The server includes several modules, typical for web servers. As a result of research, I found an XXE injection in a WebDAV module and OS command injection in a CGI module.

## XXE injection (CVE-2020-24379)

WebDAV is an HTTP protocol extension that facilitates collaboration between users in editing and managing files stored on World Wide Web servers.

The extension uses XML in some methods.

I had a working blind injection payload and started looking for a way to exploit XXE directly.

The LOCK method designed to lock the resource proved to be useful. Entity `d:href` allows returning data:

![](../../images/yaws-dav-xxe.png)

WebDAV module uses the Xmerl Erlang library for parsing messages of methods LOCK, PROPFIND and PROPPATCH. It is a rather powerful library, but it has unsafe defaults.

WebDAV must be enabled in the configuration file to be able to exploit the vulnerability:

```
<server>
  ...
  dav = true
</server>
```

Vulnerable code was introduced in the commit [16299b3](https://github.com/erlyaws/yaws/commit/16299b328a56edbc66f43588336efe8d2807cf05) on May 16, 2005. So versions 1.81 to 2.0.7 are vulnerable to XXE injection.

## OS command injection (CVE-2020-24916)

Yaws’ CGI module (Common Gateway Interface) allows executing programs that dynamically generate web pages. The usage of such interfaces is often associated with security problems.

In the Yaws, the *cgi* module is used to execute PHP scripts and other external programs.

The choice of the request handler takes place in *yaws\_server.erl*:

```
handle_ut(CliSock, ARG, UT = #urltype{type = php}, N) ->
    ...
    Fun = case SC#sconf.php_handler of
              {cgi, Exe} ->
                  fun(A)->
                          yaws_cgi:call_cgi(
                            A,Exe,lists:flatten(UT#urltype.fullpath)
                           )
    ...
```

For *.php* files, the handler calls the *Exe* program specified in the configuration.

```
handle_ut(CliSock, ARG, UT = #urltype{type = cgi}, N) ->
    ...
    deliver_dyn_part(...
                     fun(A)->yaws_cgi:call_cgi(
                               A,lists:flatten(UT#urltype.fullpath))
    ...
```

The handler makes almost the same call for *.cgi* files, except that it uses the full path to the requested file as an external program.

Yaws checks requested file existence without applying bash expansion to resolve the file path, so I was not able to exploit cgi module using these handlers.

Appmod\_cgi is a simple module that adds another handler implementing CGI behavior for anything that rests at a particular path (usually `./cgi-bin/`) and it is turned on by default.

*src/yaws\_appmod\_cgi.erl*:

```
out(Arg) ->
    yaws_cgi:call_cgi(Arg,  lists:flatten(Arg#arg.fullpath)).
```

The webserver does not check whether the requested file exists in `/cgi-bin/` but passes the path to it through a chain: call\_cgi -> cgi\_start\_worker -> cgi\_worker.

*src/yaws\_cgi.erl:*

```
cgi_worker(Parent, Arg, Exefilename, Scriptfilename, Pathinfo, ExtraEnv0, SC) ->
    ...
    CGIPort = open_port({spawn, Exefilename},
                        [{env, Env},
                         {cd, pathof(Scriptfilename)},
                         exit_status,
                         binary]),
    ...
```

The values of Exefilename, Scriptfilename, which depend on the name of the requested file, fall into the shell here.

```
call_cgi(Arg, Scriptfilename) ->
    call_cgi(Arg, undefined, Scriptfilename, undefined, []).

call_cgi(Arg, Exefilename, Scriptfilename) ->
    call_cgi(Arg, Exefilename, Scriptfilename, undefined, []).

call_cgi(Arg, Exefilename, Scriptfilename, Pathinfo) ->
    call_cgi(Arg, Exefilename, Scriptfilename, Pathinfo, []).
```

In case the *Exefilename* is undefined, its value is obtained by applying the *exeof* function to *Scriptfilename*. The function cuts everything from the beginning of the path to the last `/`.

So if we want to use `/` in our payload, we have to hide it somehow, for example, in the environment variable: `export Z=$(pwd|cut -c1)`.

Then we can get what we need from the environment: `echo pawned >> ..$Z""index.html`

Thus, a simple query allows you to write a file to the webroot:

`curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/%22%60export%20Z=$(pwd%7Ccut%20-c1);echo%20pawned%20completely%3E%3E..$Z%22%22index.html%60%22'`

Vulnerable code was introduced in the commit [7cd4080](https://github.com/erlyaws/yaws/commit/7cd40802df98ce6454bdc1003bb126a354cda3a4) on Mar 10, 2008. So versions 1.81 to 2.0.7 are vulnerable.

But Klacke retired about 5 years ago and the yaws.hyber.org site retired with him, so change almost all references to it to use something else, usually www.example.org. The only remaining references are in a couple cygwin and gentoo files, which are no longer maintained, and for historical reasons, in the www/news file. Fixes #493")

* #### [Merge rebar3 support to master](/erlyaws/yaws/commit/251c8a82d746073d8ee5687932809749890e224c "Merge rebar3 support to master The rebar3-support branch has existed for years -- Duncan McGreggor (<oubiwann@gmail.com>) first started it in April 2016 -- but has never been merged to master because of problems preventing testing with rebar3. This meant rebar3 users were usually stuck behind master until the rebar3-support branch was rebased. To alleviate these issues, and despite the testing problems with rebar3 still existing, merge rebar3 support into master. Since rebar3 doesn't need a top-level ebin directory, move ebin to ebin_src and make src/Makefile.am create the ebin directory as needed. Rename the testsuite directory to test, which is the default rebar3 looks for. Note that running tests under rebar3 still doesn't work. Use version 1.11.0 of the port_compiler. Fix issues related to deterministic builds after rebasing yaws-2.1.1 to rebar3-support. Make rebar3 create the gen-yaws-generated script. To avoid compilation errors, add nowarn_export_all to files using export_all. Change the README to no longer point users to the rebar3-support branch. Many thanks to Julius Andrikonis (<julius@erisata.lt>) for pushing this merge forward.")

* #### [Add error handling for Content-Length header](/erlyaws/yaws/commit/0556128032c9fb8efa54ca14b141bd8acb0916ca "Add error handling for Content-Length header Return HTTP 400 if Content-Length header is invalid. The Content-Length header is defined to be an integer 0 or greater. See RFC 9110 Section 8.6. Content-Length. Return HTTP 411 if Content-Length is empty for POST, if Transfer-Encoding is not set. If however Transfer-Encoding is used for POST, Content-Length is ignored. See RFC 9112 Section 6.1 Transfer-Encoding. This improves the previous behaviour when Content-Length is not an integer where Yaws immediately cut the connection. It is not totally clearly defined what to do when Content-Length is invalid, but responding with HTTP 400 Bad Request at least notifies the user of their error. One implementation detail to note is that all headers needs to be collected in order to know if Transfer-Encoding is set, if it is set Content-Lenght is ignored. However, if Transfer-Encoding is not set, the normal error handling for Content-Length is performed. This means that the report of multiple content-length headers error is deferred to when all headers are collected..")

* #### [Prevent CRLF injections in redirects](/erlyaws/yaws/commit/7ba109f3978519ffc3ea1e944ddae9e86b3cd960 "Prevent CRLF injections in redirects Redirect mappings specified in configuration are subject to CRLF injections, where the path to be redirected to on another domain is copied in the Location header, including unencoded \r and \n characters. This could lead to unwanted headers being added in the server reply, for example, a Set-cookie directive. Example in conf: <server domain1> <redirect> / = 301 https://domain2 </redirect> </server> Now, going to https://domain1/%0D%0ASet-Cookie:crlfinjection=crlfinjection would generate this reply: HTTP 1.1 301 Moved Permanently Location: https://domain2/ Set-Cookie: crlfinjection=crlfinjection ... Encode \r and \n characters as normal characters to prevent injection.")
