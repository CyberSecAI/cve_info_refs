Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24753

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing error handling check in the `cbor2json` decoder within the Objective Open CBOR Run-time (oocborrt) library. Specifically, after decoding a UTF8 string, the return value of `rtCborDecDynUTF8Str()` is not checked before using the decoded string. This function, when failing, can return prematurely, leading to the use of an uninitialized stack variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Error Check:** The core issue is the lack of a return value check after calling `rtCborDecDynUTF8Str()`.
- **Uninitialized Stack Value:** When `rtCborDecDynUTF8Str()` fails, an uninitialized stack variable, `utf8str`, which could hold leftover data from a previous operation, is passed to `rtJsonEncStringValue()`.
- **Memory Corruption:** The attacker can control the value of `utf8str` because it's uninitialized stack memory. This allows the attacker to influence memory access and cause issues such as segmentation faults, heap corruption, use-after-free, or double-free conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By causing heap corruption and influencing pointer values, an attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash due to segmentation faults, causing a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting the vulnerability can corrupt memory, leading to unpredictable behavior, data loss or program termination.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted CBOR Input:** The attack vector involves providing specially crafted CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) data to the `cbor2json` decoder.
- **Remote Exploitation:** Since the `cbor2json` utility is used in data interchange systems, the vulnerability can be potentially exploited remotely by providing malicious CBOR inputs to an affected service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious CBOR Data:** The attacker needs to be able to supply malformed CBOR data to the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of CBOR Format:** The attacker would likely need some knowledge of the CBOR format to craft the malicious inputs that exploit the vulnerability effectively.
- **System Interaction:** The attacker needs to interact with a system that uses the affected `oocborrt` library.

**Additional Information:**
- **Fuzzing Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using tools like AFL and Honggfuzz.
- **Patch Availability:** A patch was created and made available by the vendor shortly after being notified, which adds a check of return value from rtCborDecDynUTF8Str().
- **Multiple Exploitation Paths:** Proof of concepts show that this vulnerability can lead to segmentation faults, heap corruption, double frees and out of bounds heap access, depending on the specific input and system conditions.
