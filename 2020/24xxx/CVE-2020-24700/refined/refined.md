{
  "CVE-2020-24700": {
    "description": "The oAuth Proxy capability, used to exchange data with third-party services such as Twitter, can be abused to craft requests to services which are prohibited. These services may reside within a protected network and could be exposed using this technique. The code to check for allowed domains did not account for certain URL constructs.",
    "root_cause": "The oAuth Proxy capability within Open-Xchange App Suite did not properly validate URL constructs when making requests to external services.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious users can trigger network requests to web services outside of the expected trust boundary, potentially accessing internal services and retrieving content if those services lack sufficient access control. The attacker can control the request type and headers.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting API requests via /api/oauth/proxy with malicious URLs.",
      "Abusing the external mail account discovery feature to append arbitrary URL paths to email addresses, allowing access to web services outside the trust boundary by setting up malicious auto-configuration DNS records."
     ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have a valid account within the Open-Xchange App Suite. They also must be able to set up DNS records for the auto-configuration vulnerability."
