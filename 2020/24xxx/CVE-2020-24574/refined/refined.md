Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient protection of the GOG Galaxy Client service (GalaxyClientService.exe). The service attempts to verify the legitimacy of incoming requests by checking the source TCP port and associated process. However, this check can be bypassed by injecting a malicious DLL into the legitimate client process (GalaxyClient.exe). This allows an attacker to send arbitrary commands to the service with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure client verification:** The GOG Galaxy Client service relies on a simple TCP port and process check to identify trusted clients. This is insufficient and easily bypassed.
*   **Lack of DLL verification:** The service does not verify the legitimacy of DLLs loaded by its client process, allowing for DLL injection attacks.
*  **Use of a secret key:** The client signs messages using a secret key that can be extracted by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** An attacker with low-privilege access can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute any command on the system with SYSTEM privileges. This could include installing malware, creating new user accounts with admin rights, stealing data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DLL Injection:** An attacker injects a malicious DLL into the `GalaxyClient.exe` process. This injected DLL then sends malicious requests to the privileged service, `GalaxyClientService.exe`
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of local access to the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-privilege access:** The attacker must have a foothold on the target system, but not necessarily administrative rights.
*   **Ability to inject DLLs:**  The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious DLL into a running process.
*   **Knowledge of the signing key:** The attacker needs to obtain the signing key to craft valid requests to the service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects GOG Galaxy Client versions v2.0.13 through v2.0.19 and remains unpatched even after the release of v2.0.20, which was claimed to address a different security issue.
*   The vendor initially attempted to mitigate the vulnerability by changing the signing key, but this approach was ineffective and didn't address the underlying design flaw.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit tool was publicly released, demonstrating the ease of exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is considered a zero-day exploit in GOG Galaxy client due to the vendor's insufficient response.
