The provided content is related to CVE-2020-24104.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the ESSID field within the "BASIC SETTINGS" option of the PIX-LINK LV-WR07 router's web interface. This allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to store malicious JavaScript code within the router's configuration through the ESSID field.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize the ESSID field input allowing the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stolen router credentials: An attacker can use the stored XSS to steal router credentials, potentially gaining full administrative control.
- Malicious JavaScript injection: The attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript to execute malicious code on client devices accessing the router's web interface, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web interface: The vulnerability is exploited via the router's web interface, specifically through the ESSID input field in the "BASIC SETTINGS".
- HTTP Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the router's web server using the GET method at endpoint '/wireless.htm'. The malicious payload is located in the SET2 parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have network access to the router's web interface.
- HTTP Request Modification: The attacker must be capable of crafting a HTTP request containing the malicious payload in the vulnerable parameter.
