# Privilege Escalation via excessive SUDOER Permission in FruityWifi <=v2.4Â #278

## Description

![@harsh-bothra](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66528650?u=ca87545aa995016c84e171b45d6890a0a8381aff&v=4&size=48)[harsh-bothra](https://github.com/harsh-bothra)opened [on Oct 2, 2020](https://github.com/xtr4nge/FruityWifi/issues/278#issue-713817384)
# Description

During the analysis, it was observed that it is possible to abuse the Sudoer permissions of the software to perform a Privilege Escalation attack. An attacker with fruitywifi user privileges would be able to exploit issue [#276](https://github.com/xtr4nge/FruityWifi/issues/276) and can gain complete root access by executing commands as the superuser. Since the software has excessive sudo rights defined, it is possible to simply elevate the privileges without supplying any password by performing a simple command `sudo bash`.
