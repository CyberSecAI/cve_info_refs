Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-24513:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a "domain-bypass transient execution vulnerability" present in some Intel Atom Processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core weakness is a flaw in the processor's design that allows for transient execution to bypass domain restrictions. This means that under specific conditions, the processor can speculatively execute instructions beyond their intended security context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve **information disclosure**. This means that the attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data that they should not be able to see.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **local access**. This indicates that the attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system where the vulnerable processor is located.
*   Exploitation requires the attacker to be an authenticated user with the ability to execute code on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the system.
*   **Specific Intel Atom Processors:** The vulnerability only affects certain Intel Atom Processors.
*   **Specific Firmware:** The affected systems require updated firmware/BIOS to mitigate the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.6, which is considered "Medium."
*   **Mitigation:** Intel recommends users update to the latest firmware/BIOS versions provided by their system manufacturer to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** The Siemens advisory lists various industrial products (SIMATIC Drive Controllers, SIMATIC IPCs, etc.) that are affected by this CVE.

**Summary of Intel's Advisory (INTEL-SA-00465):**

*   Intel identifies this as a "domain-bypass transient execution vulnerability" specifically affecting some Intel Atom Processors.
*   Intel released firmware updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity, with the primary impact being "Information Disclosure."

**Summary of Siemens' Advisory (SSA-309571):**

*   Siemens identifies several of their industrial products using Intel CPUs as vulnerable, including: SIMATIC Drive Controller, SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller, SIMATIC IPCs, and SINUMERIK products.
*   The advisory details specific BIOS versions that remediate the vulnerability for affected products and provides links to obtain the updates.
*   For some products, no fix is currently planned, and workarounds are recommended.
*   Siemens also emphasizes the need to limit the ability to run untrusted code on affected systems.

**Debian Security Advisories:**

*   Both Debian Stable (buster) and LTS (stretch) releases received updates to `intel-microcode` packages to address this CVE, along with others.
*   These updates provide the updated CPU microcode which contains the mitigations.
*   Some regressions in certain systems were noted, requiring users to take additional action if affected (disabling microcode loading).

**In conclusion, CVE-2020-24513 is a medium-severity vulnerability related to transient execution in certain Intel Atom processors, potentially allowing local authenticated users to achieve information disclosure. Both Intel and vendors like Siemens and Debian released updates to mitigate this issue.**
