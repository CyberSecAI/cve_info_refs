WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC Field PG is a mobile, industry-standard programming device for automation engineers with all
commonly used interfaces for industrial applications that also brings pre-installed SIMATIC engineering
software.

SIMATIC IPC (Industrial PC) is the hardware platform for PC-based automation from Siemens.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility
to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in
C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel
to the STEP 7 program if required.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop floor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SINUMERIK MC is a CNC system for customized machine solutions.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automa-
tion.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some Intel Atom® Processors may allow information disclosure.Intel is releasing firmware updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2020-24513](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-24513)

Description: Domain-bypass transient execution vulnerability in some Intel Atom(R) Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 5.6 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

A list of impacted products can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/processors-affected-transient-execution-attack-mitigation-product-cpu-model).

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that users of Intel® Processorsupdate to the latest version provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.

To address this issue, an SGX TCB recovery is planned for Q2 2021. Customers will require the software update to get successful attestation responses. For customers using the Intel Attestation Service (IAS), the IAS Development Environment (DEV) will enforce the software updates beginning June 15, 2021 and the IAS Production Environment (LIV) will enforce the updates beginning July 13, 2021.

For customers that are not using IAS, but instead are constructing their own attestation infrastructure using the Intel® SGX Provisioning Certificate Service (PCS), updated Endorsements/Reference Values (i.e., PCK Certificates and verification collateral) will be available June 8, 2021. These customers decide when to enforce the software update, as part of their Appraisal Policies.

Refer to [Intel® SGX Attestation Technical Details](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/technical-details/sgx-attestation-technical-details.html) for more information on the SGX TCB recovery process.

Further [TCB Recovery Guidance](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/01/7b/Intel-SGX-Trusted-Computing-Base-Recovery.pdf) for developers is available.

### Acknowledgements:

The following issue was found internally by Intel.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.

Package        : intel-microcode
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-24489 CVE-2020-24511 CVE-2020-24512 CVE-2020-24513

This update ships updated CPU microcode for some types of Intel CPUs and
provides mitigations for security vulnerabilities which could result in
privilege escalation in combination with VT-d and various side channel
attacks.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.20210608.2~deb10u1.

Note that there are two reported regressions; for some CoffeeLake CPUs
this update may break iwlwifi
(<https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/issues/56>)
and some for Skylake R0/D0 CPUs on systems using a very outdated firmware/BIOS,
the system may hang on boot:
(<https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files/issues/31>)

If you are affected by those issues, you can recover by disabling microcode
loading on boot (as documented in README.Debian (also available online at
<https://salsa.debian.org/hmh/intel-microcode/-/blob/master/debian/README.Debian>))

We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.

For the detailed security status of intel-microcode please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/intel-microcode>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

This update ships updated CPU microcode for some types of Intel CPUs
and provides mitigations for security vulnerabilities which could
result in privilege escalation in combination with VT-d and various
side channel attacks.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.20210608.2~deb9u2.

Please note that one of the processors is not receiving this update
and so the users of 0x906ea processors that don't have Intel Wireless
on-board can use the package from the buster-security, instead.

We recommend that you upgrade your intel-microcode packages.
