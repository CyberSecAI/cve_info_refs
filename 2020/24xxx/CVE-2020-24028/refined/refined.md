Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in **insecure permissions** within ForLogic Qualiex v1 and v3. Specifically, the application does not properly enforce access control, allowing authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks, enabling users to perform actions beyond their authorized scope.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to escalate their privileges within the system.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Although not explicitly stated as an authentication bypass, the vulnerability allows authenticated users to bypass the intended access control mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability description hints at the absence of proper input validation on user creation and update processes since password changes and user creation are mentioned as attack vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain administrative or higher-level privileges within the Qualiex system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially access and disclose sensitive information.
*   **Unauthorized Account Manipulation:** The attacker can create new users, change user passwords, and modify user permissions, potentially leading to complete control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user, but does not need to have any special privileges initially.
*   **Exploiting Weak Permission Checks:** The attacker leverages the insecure permission checks on user creation, password change and update functionalities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected Qualiex v1 or v3 system.
*   No other special access or permissions are necessary.

**Summary of the Vulnerability from the provided content:**
The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to escalate privileges, disclose information, create unauthorized accounts and change passwords. This is achieved through the exploitation of insecure permissions in the application, particularly related to user creation and modifications.
