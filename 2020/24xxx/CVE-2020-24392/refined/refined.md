    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `twitter-stream` library uses the `eventmachine` library in an insecure way, specifically by not validating the hostname in the SSL/TLS certificate.",

        "Missing SSL/TLS certificate hostname validation",
        "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch (CWE-297)"

      "impact": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by impersonating a trusted server and injecting malicious data into the communication stream, compromising the integrity and authenticity of the data.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can set up a malicious server with a valid but not matching certificate and redirect traffic from the victim's application to that malicious server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and redirect the network traffic between the victim and the legitimate server (e.g., through DNS poisoning or network routing manipulation). The attacker also needs to have a valid SSL/TLS certificate for a domain that the victim's application expects."
