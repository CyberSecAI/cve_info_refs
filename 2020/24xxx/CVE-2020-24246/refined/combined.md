● PepVPN backward compatibility option is no longer available​. By deprecating the old

firmware versions, we now have a more secure handshake channel as the default setting, only
TLS 1.2 will be accepted, no more TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for the old devices. Thus, ​if you are using
devices running Firmware 6.1 or older, you will no longer be able to form PepVPN tunnels with
those devices​ unless the firmware is updated.

● Internet Explorer 11 is no longer supported by Web Admin.
● Updated minimum version of supported browser:

○ Mozilla Firefox  54
○ Google Chrome 51
○ Safari 10
○ Microsoft Edge 15
