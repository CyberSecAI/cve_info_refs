Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted JavaScript code using `JSON.stringify` in NGINX's njs module.
- Specifically, the issue occurs within the `njs_json_stringify_iterator` function when processing an array containing a getter function that modifies the array during the stringification process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is manifested as a segmentation fault (SEGV) within `memcpy`, indicating a memory corruption issue. The specific line in `njs_json.c` and the stack trace point to the `njs_json_stringify_iterator` function being the source of the vulnerability when dealing with an array.
- The getter function modifies the array structure unexpectedly during the JSON stringification. This leads to `memcpy` attempting to read data from an invalid memory address, causing the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, crashing the njs process, which will in turn cause a denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution (not explicitly stated but implied):** The heap overflow can potentially be leveraged to achieve more serious consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing specially crafted Javascript code to NGINX which utilizes `JSON.stringify` on a malicious array.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker having control over the njs module and the input data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript code within the context of an NGINX server running the vulnerable njs module. This usually involves a server-side vulnerability that allows the attacker to inject javascript code, or to provide a crafted input data that triggers the vulnerability in the server.
- The attacker must be able to provide the malicious payload (Javascript).
- Based on the Netapp advisory, a low privileged user can trigger the vulnerability locally.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub issue (#322) provides a proof-of-concept (POC) JavaScript code that triggers the crash.
- The NetApp advisory mentions that the vulnerability affects versions of njs in NGINX through 0.4.3.
- NetApp identifies this vulnerability to lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS), and provides a CVSS score of 5.5 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, which indicates that a local, low privileged attacker can cause a DoS by exploiting this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-24348 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `njs_json_stringify_iterator` function in NGINX's njs module. This can be triggered by providing specially crafted javascript code, leading to a denial of service (DoS) and potentially to remote code execution.
