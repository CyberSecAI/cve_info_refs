### Gophish just got better.

We're excited to announce the release of Gophish v0.11.0. This release includes important security fixes, adds some minor features, and fixes some bugs.

### Security Fixes

This release addresses multiple security issues that were identified and reported by the community. As always, we encourage sending in security reports via our [security policy](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/blob/master/SECURITY.md), and are appreciative of all the work that went in to finding and reporting these vulnerabilities.

The following vulnerabilities were fixed in this latest release:

#### Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Reported by: Marcus Nilsson of usd AG

Reported by: [@dunderhay](https://github.com/dunderhay) in [#1908](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/issues/1908)

An authenticated user could use certain features of Gophish to make inbound connections to the local network. The most critical of these is via the Landing Page import feature, which could be used to make arbitrary upstream web requests.

Since importing local webpages, or otherwise making local network connections (e.g. for SMTP/IMAP servers, webhook URLs, etc.) is an expected use case for Gophish we've decided to implement an opt-in allowlist. By default, we block access only to known IP addresses commonly associated with cloud metadata services, but it is now possible to explicitly set the `allowed_internal_hosts` configuration variable in the `admin_server` section of config.json to a list of allowed internal addresses.

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/e3352f481e94054ffe08494c9225d3878347b005).

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Reported By: Marcus Nilsson of usd AG

Reported By: [@dunderhay](https://github.com/dunderhay) in [#1901](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/issues/1901)

Various cross-site scripting issues were identified and fixed. All issues required authenticated access and only affected either the user that created the objects, or an administrator using our "Impersonate" issue to impersonate the user that created the objects.

More information can be found in [4e9b94b](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/4e9b94b641755f359542b246cc0c555fa3bc6715) and [19ef924](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/19ef924d89f6e2459387d5645233f16fd07e01b3).

#### CSV Injection

Reported By: Marcus Nilsson of usd AG

Malicious data could be submitted during a campaign that, when exported as a CSV and opened in a spreadsheet viewer, is interpreted as a formula leading to command execution.

More information on CSV Injection can be found [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection). More information about the fix can be found in [b25f5ac](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/b25f5ac5e468f6730e377f43c7995e18f8fccc2b).

#### Clickjacking

Reported By: Marcus Nilsson of usd AG

An attacker could create an iframe which tricks an authenticated administrator into unexpectedly clicking the "Reset" button in the settings page, causing their API key to be reset, potentially causing a denial of service condition.

More information about the fix can be found in [6df62e8](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/6df62e85fd60f0931d3c8bfdb13b436a961bc9b6).

### Adding a Password Policy

This release adds a basic password policy for administrators, and removes the default password "gophish". Instead, an initial password is randomly generated and printed in the terminal when Gophish is launched for the first time.

It is possible to override the initial password and API key with environment variables if needed.

### More Robust IMAP Support

This release adds the ability to mark emails as reported that were sent as an attachment. Additionally, it changes the underlying IMAP library to be more robust, eliminating some possible bugs.

Credit to [@glennzw](https://github.com/glennzw) for the changes!

### Changelog

You can find the full changelog for this release [here.](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/compare/v0.10.1...v0.11.0)

### How to Upgrade

To upgrade, download the release for your platform, extract into a folder, and copy (**remember to copy, not move so that you have a backup**) your existing gophish.db file into the new directory. Then, run the new Gophish binary and you'll be good to go!

Now, one more thing:

# usd-2020-0052 | Gophish v0.10.1

**Advisory ID**: usd-2020-0052
**CVE Number**: CVE-2020-24707
**Affected Product**: Gophish
**Affected Version**: v0.10.1
**Vulnerability Type**: CSV Injection
**Security Risk**: Medium
**Vendor URL**: <https://getgophish.com/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed

###

### Description

Gophish allows the creation of CSV sheets which contain malicious content.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following screenshots show how a spreadsheet formula that is injected as the first name of a mail recipient executes when opened in a spreadsheet software such as Libreoffice Calc.

Inject Spreadsheet formular `(=1+1)` at `/groups`

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-1.png "usd20200052-1")

Launch a campaign at `/campaigns`

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-2.png "usd20200052-2")

Export campaign results as CSV and open the file using LibreOffice Calc

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-3.png "usd20200052-3")

Most spreadsheet software supports the functionality of formulas as for example OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Office Excel. Here, any cell starting with an equal- (=), a plus- (+) or a minus-sign (-) will be interpreted as a formula and may contain malicious code as shown in the example above. Additionally, older software versions interpret cells starting with an at-sign (@) as formulas as well.

For OpenOffice, this vulnerability is classified as CVE-2014-3524 which emphasizes the risk of unfiltered spreadsheets. Due to this vulnerability, an attacker can take over the control of a victim’s system or gain unauthorized access to private resources.

### Fix

It is recommended to restrict the set of allowed characters as much as possible for all user input. This can, for example, be realized with a whitelist.
Additionally, every cell that starts with an equal- (=), a plus- (+), a minus- (-) or an at-sign (@), or contains a comma (,) or a semicolon (;) should be embedded in double quotes („) when generating spreadsheets, such as csv, xls or xlsx files, automatically. Furthermore, every double quote occurring within the content of a cell should be preceded by another double quote to avoid an early termination of the quoted string. In order to achieve this, a suitable library can be used.

```
I've updated the PapaParse JS library to the latest version from the master branch which supports the `escapeForumlae` option in order to prevent malicious event entries from being parsed and executed by the Gophish user's spreadsheet software.

When a new PapaParse release is created, I'll update this code to use the updated minified file.

# usd-2020-0052 | Gophish v0.10.1

**Advisory ID**: usd-2020-0052
**CVE Number**: CVE-2020-24707
**Affected Product**: Gophish
**Affected Version**: v0.10.1
**Vulnerability Type**: CSV Injection
**Security Risk**: Medium
**Vendor URL**: <https://getgophish.com/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed

###

### Description

Gophish allows the creation of CSV sheets which contain malicious content.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following screenshots show how a spreadsheet formula that is injected as the first name of a mail recipient executes when opened in a spreadsheet software such as Libreoffice Calc.

Inject Spreadsheet formular `(=1+1)` at `/groups`

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-1.png "usd20200052-1")

Launch a campaign at `/campaigns`

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-2.png "usd20200052-2")

Export campaign results as CSV and open the file using LibreOffice Calc

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/usd20200052-3.png "usd20200052-3")

Most spreadsheet software supports the functionality of formulas as for example OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Office Excel. Here, any cell starting with an equal- (=), a plus- (+) or a minus-sign (-) will be interpreted as a formula and may contain malicious code as shown in the example above. Additionally, older software versions interpret cells starting with an at-sign (@) as formulas as well.

For OpenOffice, this vulnerability is classified as CVE-2014-3524 which emphasizes the risk of unfiltered spreadsheets. Due to this vulnerability, an attacker can take over the control of a victim’s system or gain unauthorized access to private resources.

### Fix

It is recommended to restrict the set of allowed characters as much as possible for all user input. This can, for example, be realized with a whitelist.
Additionally, every cell that starts with an equal- (=), a plus- (+), a minus- (-) or an at-sign (@), or contains a comma (,) or a semicolon (;) should be embedded in double quotes („) when generating spreadsheets, such as csv, xls or xlsx files, automatically. Furthermore, every double quote occurring within the content of a cell should be preceded by another double quote to avoid an early termination of the quoted string. In order to achieve this, a suitable library can be used.

### About usd Security Advisories

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/icon-hero.png "icon-hero")

In order to protect businesses against hackers and criminals, we always have to keep our skills and knowledge up to date. Thus, security research is just as important for our work as is building up a security community to promote the exchange of knowledge. After all, more security can only be achieved if many individuals take on the task.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications. In this context, the [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) publishes a series of papers on new vulnerabilities and current security issues.

Always for the sake of our mission: „more security.“

[to usd AG](https://www.usd.de/)

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)
