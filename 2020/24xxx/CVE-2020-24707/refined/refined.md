Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when generating CSV files in the Gophish application. Specifically, spreadsheet formulas injected into user-controlled fields (e.g., first name of a mail recipient) are not escaped, leading to CSV injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The primary vulnerability is CSV injection. When a user exports data as a CSV file, spreadsheet software interprets cells starting with characters like "=", "+", "-", or "@" as formulas. By crafting malicious strings containing spreadsheet formulas, an attacker can inject code that executes when the CSV file is opened.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Execution:**  The injected formulas can lead to arbitrary command execution on the victim's machine when the exported CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet application. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to private resources or take over the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:**  The attack vector is through user-controlled input fields, specifically the first name field of a mail recipient during campaign setup.
*   **CSV Export:** The attack is triggered when an administrator exports campaign results as a CSV file and opens it using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Gophish application with the ability to create and manage campaigns. They need to be able to inject malicious data into the fields that will be exported into the CSV.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to trick the administrator into opening the malicious CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Additional Details**
The vulnerability was fixed in commit `b25f5ac5e468f6730e377f43c7995e18f8fccc2b` by using `escapeFormulae` option in PapaParse library.

The advisory from usd HeroLab also suggests whitelisting allowed input characters and using double quotes to escape special characters in CSV files as mitigation.
