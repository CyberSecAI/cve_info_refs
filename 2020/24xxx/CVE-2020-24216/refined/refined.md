Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the RTSP URL within the video encoder's firmware. The application does not check the provided URL and will stream video regardless of the URL provided in the RTSP request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The RTSP server does not validate or sanitize the RTSP URL provided by the user.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The application fails to implement access controls for video streaming via RTSP and allows unauthorized access to the video stream through any URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Video Stream:** Attackers can gain access to the video stream without authentication, potentially allowing them to view sensitive content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can access the vulnerable RTSP service remotely if exposed to the network.
*   **RTSP Protocol:** Attackers leverage the RTSP protocol to initiate a connection to the vulnerable device and request the video stream using any URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **RTSP Knowledge:** The attacker must be familiar with the basic operation of the RTSP protocol.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple vendors' devices as they appear to share the same vulnerable software.
*   The blog post provides significantly more detail than the official CVE description.
