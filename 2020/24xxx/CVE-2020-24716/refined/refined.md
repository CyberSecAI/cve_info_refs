Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-24716:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content, specifically the commit message and code changes within the GitHub diff, directly relate to the reported vulnerability described as "Fix UNIX permissions checking". This commit (716b53d0a14c72bda16c0872565dd1909757e73f) addresses an issue with how UNIX permissions were being handled in OpenZFS on FreeBSD.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the incorrect or incomplete implementation of permission checks within the ZFS file system, specifically concerning the mapping of file ownership and group membership when using non-POSIX IDs, likely related to Windows ACLs. The code was not properly checking the validity of the file's FUID.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Permission Checks:** The original code in `zfs_acl.c` had a fast-path check for execution permissions which was not correctly handling file ownership via FUIDs(File User IDs). It was checking the POSIX uid and gid of a file and not the FUID, resulting in an bypass of permission checks if the FUID was not 0.
- **Inconsistent ID Mapping:** The `zfs_fuid.c` file showed discrepancies in how IDs were mapped across different platforms (FreeBSD, Linux, and others). The original logic for non-FreeBSD systems was to simply return the given FUID, while FreeBSD used `UID_NOBODY`.
- **Missing FUID check in group membership:** The `zfs_groupmember` function also required changes to use the mapped FUIDs when checking for group membership.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially bypass file system permission checks, leading to unauthorized access to files and directories. The impact would depend on the specific system configuration, but could lead to:

- Unauthorized data access.
- Potential privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities.
- Data corruption through unauthorized modification.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the file system interface. Any operation that involves permission checks on files, such as executing files, or any form of access, is a potential attack vector.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user that does not own a file, but can potentially execute the file, if permissions checks are bypassed.
- No specific network access is required for this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- **`zfs_acl.c` Changes:** The `zfs_fastaccesschk_execute` function was modified to remove an optimization that bypassed permission checks by checking if the `FUID_INDEX` was 0 or not.
- **`zfs_fuid.c` Changes:** The `zfs_fuid_map_id` was modified to map a given FUID to a uid based on idmap using the FUID_INDEX and FUID_RID.
- **`zfs_groupmember` Changes:** The `zfs_groupmember` function was modified to map the given FUID to the correct gid before making the groupmember check.
- **`Makefile.bsd` Changes:** The make file included the HAVE_KSID define when compiling the code.
- **Header File Changes:** The header files `idmap.h`, `kidmap.h`, and `sid.h` were included to support the FUID changes.

In summary, the provided content clearly demonstrates a fix for a permission bypass vulnerability in OpenZFS on FreeBSD, where file access was not correctly enforced when FUIDs where in use, due to an incomplete implementation of permission checking.
