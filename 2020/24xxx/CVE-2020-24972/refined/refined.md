Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24972:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `openpgp4fpr:` URLs by the Kleopatra component of GnuPG. Specifically, command-line options within these URLs were not being safely handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The `openpgp4fpr:` URL handler in Kleopatra does not properly sanitize command-line parameters.
- **Unsafe use of `platformpluginpath`**: The Qt `platformpluginpath` command-line option can be used to load an arbitrary DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the Kleopatra process.
- **Denial of Service:**  Although not the primary impact, a denial of service condition is also possible through this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is initiated remotely through a specially crafted `openpgp4fpr:` URL.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to process the malicious URL, typically by clicking on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious `openpgp4fpr:` URL to the victim.
- **User Enticement:** The attacker must trick the user into interacting with the malicious URL.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Kleopatra versions prior to 3.1.12 and before 20.07.80.
- The fix involves ensuring that parameters in the URL are not treated as command-line options, but as positional arguments.  This prevents the use of options like `platformpluginpath`.
- The vulnerable code parses parameters as values, instead of positional arguments which can be exploited to inject command-line options.
- Patches have been applied to various distributions (openSUSE, Fedora, Gentoo) to remediate the issue.
