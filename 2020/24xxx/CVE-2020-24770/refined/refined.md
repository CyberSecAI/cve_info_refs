Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24770

**Affected Software:** NexusPHP 1.5

**Fixed Version:** NexusPHP v1.6.0-beta2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `modrules.php` file, specifically at line 42.
- The code directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$id`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by the unsanitized `$id` variable being used directly within the SQL query:
  ```php
  $res = @mysql_fetch_array(@sql_query("select * from rules where id='$id'"));
  ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit uses the `sleep()` function, which can be used to cause delays and potentially disrupt the application's availability.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successful SQL injection could lead to more severe attacks, such as data modification or complete system compromise, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `modrules.php` script with the `act` parameter set to `edit` and the `id` parameter containing a malicious SQL payload.
  - Example: `/modrules.php?act=edit&id=1%27%20and%20sleep(2)%23`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication as Administrator:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to exploit this vulnerability, as indicated by the presence of the `administrator_cookies` in the provided example HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided exploit demonstrates a time-based SQL injection.
- Injecting `1' and sleep(2)#` into the `id` parameter causes the server to pause for 2 seconds before responding, which confirms the injection is successful.
- Injecting `1' and sleep(0)#` causes no delay, further confirming the successful execution of the injected SQL.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable code uses the deprecated `mysql_*` functions, which are known to be vulnerable to SQL injection. This highlights a broader security issue in the application's development practices.
