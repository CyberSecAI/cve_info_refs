Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `easywebpack-cli` when handling the `-d` parameter, which specifies the directory to serve. Specifically, the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal (Directory Traversal):** The core vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By supplying paths like `../../` through the `-d` parameter, an attacker can navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files outside of the intended web directory. This can include configuration files (e.g. database connection files), source code, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive files can lead to information disclosure, potentially enabling further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Command-Line Argument:** The attack vector is the `-d` command-line argument used when running `easywebpack-cli`.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Once the server is running, HTTP requests are used to access the files via the crafted path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local or Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute `easywebpack-cli` with the crafted `-d` argument. This could be a local user or potentially someone with remote access to the server where the tool is being used.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know to use the `-d` parameter and how to craft the path traversal payload (e.g., using `../../`).
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Request:** Attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to access the files via the crafted path.

**Summary**

The content describes a path traversal vulnerability in `easywebpack-cli` where an attacker can access files outside the intended directory by providing a specially crafted path in the `-d` parameter. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
