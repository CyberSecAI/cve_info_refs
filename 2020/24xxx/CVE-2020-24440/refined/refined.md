- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application's search path for loading resources is not properly controlled, allowing an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files that will be loaded and executed by the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: By placing a malicious file in a location where the application searches for resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file in a location that is part of the application's search path.
