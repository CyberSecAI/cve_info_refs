Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Shotcut's update check mechanism not using a secure (HTTPS) network connection in previous versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure communication:** The application was making an HTTP request rather than HTTPS when checking for updates. This lack of TLS encryption exposed the communication channel to potential interception and modification.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability**: An attacker could intercept the HTTP request and replace the legitimate update information (URL to the release notes and download link) with a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware distribution:** A successful attacker could redirect users to a malicious website or server, tricking them into downloading and installing a compromised version of Shotcut or other malware, disguised as an update.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By installing a modified version of Shotcut, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **MitM attack:** An attacker needs to position themselves in the network path between the user's computer and the update server. This could be done on a public Wi-Fi network or through other network compromise techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network interception capability:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic.
- **Ability to modify HTTP responses:** The attacker must be able to modify the response from the update server to point the user to a malicious URL.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version 20.09.13 by switching to a secure HTTPS connection.
- The commit message "fix upgrade check is not using TLS correctly" from the Github content confirms the issue and the fix.
- The github diff shows the removal of the http request and enforces the https request.
