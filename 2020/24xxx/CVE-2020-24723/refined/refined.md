Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-24723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "User Registration & Login and User Management System" version 2.1. Specifically, user-supplied data entered during registration is not sanitized before being stored in the database or when displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the system and stored persistently.
- Input validation failure: The application does not filter or sanitize user input, particularly the "First name" and "Last name" fields during user registration.
- Output encoding failure: The application does not properly encode user-controlled data when it is displayed, allowing the browser to interpret the stored JavaScript as active content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Admin Account Takeover: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when an admin views the user management section. This could allow the attacker to steal the admin's session cookie and completely take over the admin account.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By injecting JavaScript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser.
- Data Theft: The attacker can steal sensitive information, like cookies, or manipulate other user's data.
- Potential for further attacks: An attacker might use the XSS vulnerability to launch further attacks, such as phishing or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User Registration Page: The attacker injects the XSS payload into the "First name" or "Last name" fields during the user registration process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the user registration page of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to register a new user account and inject the XSS payload.
- The attack is triggered when an administrator views the user list in the admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameters: "First Name" and "Last Name" fields.
- Payload example: `<script>alert(“XSS”)</script>`
- When the admin visits the "manage users" section, the XSS payload is triggered because the injected script is retrieved from the database and rendered in the browser without proper encoding.

**Mitigation:**
- Input filtering: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious characters.
- Output encoding: Encode all user-controllable data at the point of output to prevent browsers from interpreting it as active code. This involves HTML, URL, Javascript, and CSS encoding as needed.
- Use appropriate response headers: Use "Content-Type" and "X-Content-Type-Options" headers to enforce the intended interpretation of responses by browsers.
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP to limit the sources of allowed active content, adding a final layer of defense against XSS.
