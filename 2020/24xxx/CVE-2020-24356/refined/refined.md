Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24356:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in how `cloudflared` reads its configuration file on Windows. Specifically, the directory `C:\etc` is not secure by default on Windows as it lacks default access controls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Insecure default directory permissions: The `C:\etc` directory, where `cloudflared` reads its configuration from, has no default access controls, allowing any user to write files to it.
-  Unsafe configuration file handling: `cloudflared` allows users to define a log file path within its configuration. A malformed config file can be placed in the insecure `C:\etc` directory.
-  Uncontrolled log file location: The application will output an error message to a log file defined in the malformed config file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation: An unprivileged user can exploit the misconfiguration to gain system-level privileges by controlling the location of the log file.
- Arbitrary code execution: By setting the log file path to a specific location that Windows executes when any user logs in, an attacker can execute system-level commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious configuration file: An attacker crafts a malformed `config.yaml` file with a malicious log file path.
- Writing to insecure directory: The attacker places this malicious configuration file in `C:\etc` due to the lack of access controls.
- `cloudflared` reads the configuration and writes an error message to the attacker controlled log file location, leading to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access: The attacker must have local access to the Windows system where `cloudflared` is installed.
- Unprivileged user: The attacker does not need elevated privileges initially. They can be a regular user.
- Cloudflared must have been previously started as administrator: The vulnerable behavior relies on an administrator having started the `cloudflared` service.
