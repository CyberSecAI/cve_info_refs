Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-24387:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the session ID returned by the YubiHSM2 device during the session creation process within the `yh_create_session()` function in the `libyubihsm` library. The library uses the received session ID as an index into a fixed-size array of sessions without any bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds write:** If the HSM returns a session ID that exceeds the maximum allowed number of sessions (16 in this case), the library will write data outside of the bounds of the `sessions` array.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:** When an out-of-bounds session ID is used, subsequent operations that try to use the corrupted session data will cause out-of-bounds reads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The out-of-bounds write corrupts memory, which can lead to a segmentation fault (crash) when the code tries to access or manipulate corrupted session data later on, specifically when the library attempts to use the invalid session data during the secure message sending phase, or during the cleanup when closing the session. The crash terminates the process embedding the `libyubihsm` library, disrupting the functionality of the application utilizing the HSM.
*   **Memory corruption:** While the provided text does not describe more serious consequences, the out-of-bounds write can theoretically cause unpredictable behavior in the program, since the memory write can overwrite any data in the global buffer located after the session array.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HSM device:** An attacker controlling a malicious HSM device can send a crafted response with an invalid session ID during session creation.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker intercepting the communication between the host and the HSM can modify the HSM response to include an out-of-bounds session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the capability to either control the HSM or be in a position to perform a MITM attack on the communication channel between the host and the HSM.
*   The attacker does not require prior knowledge of device secrets, keys or special device states.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specific crafted response to the host, including a response with the `YHC_AUTHENTICATE_SESSION_R` flag.

**Additional Information:**
*   The blog post provides more technical details than the CVE description, including code snippets, ASAN error output, and a proof-of-concept.
*   The vulnerability exists in the client-side `libyubihsm` library, not in the HSM device itself.
*   The vulnerability is triggered before any cryptographic operations on the session level occur.
*   The blog post also mentions a related vulnerability, CVE-2020-24388, which involves a length check issue in `_send_secure_msg()`
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered using fuzzing techniques.
*   The fix was released in the YubiHSM2 SDK version 2020.10
