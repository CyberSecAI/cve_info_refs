Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an XML Entity Expansion injection vulnerability present in the Dashboard Editor of Pentaho. Specifically, the `dashboardXml` parameter is vulnerable to this attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: The software fails to properly sanitize or validate the XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities that can lead to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By exploiting the XML Entity Expansion vulnerability, an attacker can cause excessive resource consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is launched remotely over the network.
- Input Manipulation: The attacker crafts a malicious XML payload embedded within the `dashboardXml` parameter of the Dashboard Editor in Pentaho.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate with the Pentaho application and access the Dashboard Editor.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network connectivity to send malicious requests to the vulnerable Pentaho instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Pentaho versions 7.x through 8.x.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Andrej Å imko of Accenture.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Pentaho versions >= 7.1.0.25, >= 8.2.0.6, and >= 8.3.0.0 GA.
