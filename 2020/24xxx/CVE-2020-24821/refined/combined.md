## Description

![@xiaoxiongwang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48821972?u=c2953a843eb36275c37e07f8eafe2697ef97e463&v=4&size=48)[xiaoxiongwang](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang)opened [on Aug 15, 2020](https://github.com/aclements/libelfin/issues/52#issue-679574044)

Tested in Ubuntu 16.04, 64bit.

The tested program is the example program dump-tree.

The testcase is [dump\_tree\_segv3](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang/function_bugs/blob/master/libelfin/dump_tree_segv3).

I use the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-tree dump_tree_segv3

```

and get:

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

I use **valgrind** to analysis the bug and get the below information (absolute path information omitted):

```

```

I use **AddressSanitizer** to build ffjpeg and running it with the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-tree dump_tree_segv3

```

This is the ASAN information (absolute path information omitted):

```
/path-to-libelfin-address/examples/dump-tree dump_tree_segv3

```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious elf file that exploits this bug which will result in a Denial of Service (DoS).
