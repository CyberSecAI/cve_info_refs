- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect security attribute was applied in the iOS secure-store implementation of the Expo SDK. Specifically, when the `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` flag was used, the code incorrectly applied the `kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly` policy, which is one of the least secure options.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a security misconfiguration where a less restrictive security attribute was applied than intended. This means data stored with `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` was more accessible than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is that data meant to be accessible only when the device is unlocked and only on that specific device would be accessible even when the device is locked.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the device would have the ability to potentially access the data stored via the secure-store even if the device is locked (given it was stored with the `WHEN_UNLOCKED_THIS_DEVICE_ONLY` flag but incorrect implementation).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would require physical access to the unlocked or locked device.
