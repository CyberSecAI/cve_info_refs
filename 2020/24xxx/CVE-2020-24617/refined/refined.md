Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-24617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied input (`column`) when constructing a SQL query within the `statsClickedSubscribersByColumn` function in `lib/models/campaigns.js`. Specifically, the input is directly used in the `util.format` function without sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-provided input is directly incorporated into a SQL query, enabling attackers to manipulate the database.
2. **Missing CSRF Protection:** The HTTP request to trigger the SQL injection does not require CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious page that, if loaded by a logged-in user, could trigger the SQL injection, even if the attacker doesn't have direct access to the application.
3. **Improper Database User Privileges (Contextual):**  The impact of the SQL injection is heightened if the database user has broad permissions. While not a vulnerability in the code itself, improperly configured database user privileges make the vulnerability more dangerous.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of successful exploitation can vary depending on the database user privileges.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Arbitrary File Read:** If the database user has the required privileges, attackers can potentially achieve RCE or read arbitrary files from the server hosting the database.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Even with restricted database privileges, attackers can cause a denial of service by injecting queries that cause the database to slow down or crash.
* **Timing-Based Blind Read:** If direct output from the database is not revealed, an attacker could still infer data by injecting queries that cause time delays (blind SQL injection).

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exposed via a POST request to the `/campaigns/clicked/ajax` endpoint, specifically targeting the `statsClickedSubscribersByColumn` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the Mailtrain server.
2.  **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of HTTP requests and SQL.
3.  **CSRF Chaining (Optional but impactful):** If the attacker does not have valid Mailtrain credentials, they can chain a CSRF attack with the SQL injection by making a request using a logged-in user.

The provided information from the Security Lab describes the vulnerability in greater detail, noting how an unauthenticated attacker can leverage it with CSRF.  It also clearly spells out the SQL injection payload and the response.
