Based on the provided information, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-24203:

**Summary:**

The provided content details a Travel Management System project and an associated exploit, `TravelManagementSystem_Unauth_RCE`, found on GitHub. This exploit targets an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in version 1.0 of the Travel Management System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated but the existence of an unauthenticated RCE exploit implies a flaw in the application where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full system compromise:** An attacker could gain complete control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The exploit can be triggered remotely over the network, as indicated by the mention of a Python exploit script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable Travel Management System.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to authenticate or log in to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The project's description on Projectworlds indicates it uses PHP and MySQL.
*   The provided exploit code `TravelManagementRCE.py` suggests that a Python script is used to exploit the vulnerability.

**In summary:**
The provided content describes a critical RCE vulnerability in a Travel Management System which can be exploited remotely without authentication. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Relevance to CVE-2020-24203:**
While the provided content details an RCE vulnerability, it does not explicitly mention CVE-2020-24203, or make direct reference to an official CVE. It is possible that this vulnerability could be assigned this CVE number if it matches the description, but it is not currently mentioned. Further investigation of the actual vulnerability and confirmation from a trusted source like NVD would be required to confirm the association.
