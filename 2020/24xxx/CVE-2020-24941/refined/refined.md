- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unexpected updates can occur in Eloquent models using the `$guarded` property when requests are crafted with JSON column nesting expressions (e.g., `{"foo->bar": "value"}`). Even if the `foo` column is guarded, the nested `bar` key within the JSON column can be updated via mass assignment because `foo->bar` isn't explicitly listed in the guarded clause.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of JSON column nesting expressions during mass assignment when using the `$guarded` property. This allows for modification of data within guarded JSON columns.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized modification of data within guarded columns through crafted requests, potentially leading to data corruption or other security issues.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted HTTP requests containing JSON column nesting expressions used during mass assignment to update model attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests with JSON column nesting expressions to the application that trigger mass assignment operations on Eloquent models using the `$guarded` property.
