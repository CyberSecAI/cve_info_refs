- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Eloquent ORM in Laravel would automatically strip table names from mass-assigned attributes, which bypassed the intended "fillable" and "guarded" logic, leading to potential injection of unvalidated data into the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unintended mass assignment of model attributes due to automatic stripping of table names, bypassing the fillable/guarded protection mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially inject arbitrary values into the database by including table names in the mass-assigned attributes, potentially leading to data corruption, privilege escalation, or other security issues.
- **Attack vectors**: By mass assigning model attributes that include table names, attackers could bypass validation and write data directly to database columns.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to control the data used in mass assignment operations of a Laravel Eloquent model.
