**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation or sanitization of POST parameters `devicePwd` and `key` in the `/admin/powerline` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain full control of the device by executing arbitrary commands with root privileges, because the HTTP server runs as `root`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious POST data to the `/admin/powerline` endpoint with the `form` parameter set to either `plc_add` or `plc_device`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A remote authenticated attacker with access to the LAN where the device is located.
- Alternatively, an attacker with access to the web management interface exposed to the internet.
- The attacker must be able to authenticate with the web management interface, default password is `admin`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects TP-Link TL-WPA4220 Powerline Adapter/WiFi Extender hardware versions 2, 3, and 4.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available on GitHub.
- TP-Link released a firmware patch for hardware version 4, but versions 2 and 3 remain vulnerable.
- The web management interface is sometimes exposed to the internet, potentially making the device remotely exploitable by attackers.
