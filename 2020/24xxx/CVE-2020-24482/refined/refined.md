- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper buffer restrictions in the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of buffer sizes which leads to a potential denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unauthenticated user can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access and does not require any specific authentication or user interaction.
