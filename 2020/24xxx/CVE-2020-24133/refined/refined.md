Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in the commits related to CVE-2020-24133:

**Vulnerability 1: Heap Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `r_asm_swf_disass` function within `libr/asm/arch/swf/swfdis.c`. Specifically, when handling string opcodes (case 0), the code uses `sprintf` to copy the string into the `name` buffer without any size checks. The `str` pointer directly reads from the input buffer. If the string is too large it causes a heap overflow.
*   **Weakness:**  Unbounded string copy using `sprintf` into a fixed-size buffer.
*  **Impact:** A heap overflow can lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior if exploited.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious SWF file with an overly long string.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious SWF file to the vulnerable code.

**Vulnerability 2: Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `r_asm_swf_disass` function within `libr/asm/arch/swf/swfdis.c`. Specifically, two instances of `sprintf` used to format the output of `SWFACTION_GETURL` and `SWFACTION_SETTARGET` opcodes.
    *  `sprintf (buf_asm, "%s %s", op.name, url);`
    *  `sprintf (buf_asm, "%s %s", op.name, target);`
    If the combined length of `op.name` and `url` (or `target`) is larger than the size of the `buf_asm` buffer, it will cause a stack buffer overflow. The `url` and `target` pointers read directly from the input buffer and is not checked for size.
*   **Weakness:** Unbounded string copy using `sprintf` into a fixed-size stack buffer.
*   **Impact:** A stack buffer overflow can lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior if exploited.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious SWF file with opcodes that point to overly long strings.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious SWF file to the vulnerable code.

**Fixes**

The commit `9f6a221433964d9b14f3ed78bc9fb059395b893b` addresses the heap overflow vulnerability by changing the `sprintf` call to `snprintf`.

The commit `4a8b24475549ff10bdf6d07fd4b5f6c1cc6246ea` addresses the stack buffer overflow by changing the vulnerable `sprintf` calls to `snprintf` as well.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes links to the specific commits fixing these issues.
*   The issues were discovered by JJY-sec and fixed by a pull request which was merged into master.
*   The maintainer noted that additional code cleanup is needed, however, the primary concern was to resolve the exploitable buffer overflows.
