{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient access controls on the Virtual Machine Control Structure (VMCS) on Intel CPUs and the Virtual Machine Control Block (VMCB) on AMD CPUs allow root users, including those in a jail, to modify these data structures.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient access controls on VMCS/VMCB data structures.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with host root access (including to a jailed bhyve instance) can achieve kernel code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attacker with root access to the host or a jailed bhyve instance can modify the VMCS/VMCB data structures.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Root access on the host system or within a jailed bhyve instance."
