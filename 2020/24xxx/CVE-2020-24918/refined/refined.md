Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-24918:

**Verification:**
The provided content from somersetrecon.squarespace.com details research on Furbo dog cameras, specifically mentioning a vulnerability in the RTSP service which is identified as related to the Ambarella SDK. This aligns with the CVE, which involves an Ambarella product, indicating that the content is highly relevant.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the RTSP server's authentication header parsing, specifically within the `parse_authenticaton_header()` function of the `libamprotocol-rtsp.so.1` library, which is part of the Ambarella SDK.
- The `sscanf` function is used to parse the username parameter from the authentication header, and it copies the username value to a fixed-size buffer without a length check, leading to an overflow when the username exceeds 132 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `sscanf` function copies data into a fixed size buffer `value[132]` without proper bounds checking.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The RTSP server doesn't validate the length of the username before copying it into a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Attackers can overwrite the return address on the stack and potentially control the program execution flow.
- **Root Access:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker root-level code execution on the Furbo device.
- **Device Control:** With root access, attackers can perform various malicious actions such as recording audio and video, tossing treats, stealing the RTSP password, and more.
- **Denial of Service:** By sending a malformed RTSP request with an oversized username, the RTSP service can be crashed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via crafted RTSP requests.
- **RTSP Service:** The attack targets the vulnerable RTSP service running on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target device.
- **RTSP Client:** An attacker needs to be able to send RTSP requests to the device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a malicious RTSP request with an overly long username.
- **Optional:** While not strictly required, knowledge of how to bypass ASLR and NX bit could be necessary if the attacker is not able to leverage the watchdog service restarting the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Ambarella SDK which may affect other devices using their chipset.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `libamprotocol-rtsp.so.1` file, indicating the usage of Ambarella's proprietary code.
- The RTSP service uses HTTP digest authentication, which involves a realm and nonce.
- The exploit reliability is affected by ASLR, however, the watchdog service restarts the service after a crash, allowing a brute force attack for code execution by repeating the exploit with precomputed memory address.
- While this vulnerability was discovered on the Furbo Dog Camera it is likely present in other devices using the Ambarella SDK.

The content goes into great detail about the reverse engineering and exploitation process including gaining root access via UART, debugging the crash, analyzing the vulnerable function, and crafting a working PoC (Proof of Concept) and includes python scripts to exploit the issue.
