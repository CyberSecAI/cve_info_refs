Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the Episerver Find's `ClickController.Index()` method, which directly uses untrusted user input from the `_t_redirect` URL parameter to perform a redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Open Redirect:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize the URL provided in the `_t_redirect` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to any arbitrary website.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization for user-supplied parameters used in the redirection logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Redirection:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing a crafted `_t_redirect` parameter pointing to a malicious website, and when a user clicks on the crafted link, they are redirected to the attacker's website.
- **Phishing and Credential Theft:** This could enable phishing attacks, where the attacker redirects the user to a fake login page designed to steal their credentials.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to a website that downloads malware onto their system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the vulnerable `_t_redirect` parameter with a malicious URL as its value.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick the victim into clicking the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker only needs to know about the vulnerable endpoint and the `_t_redirect` parameter. They don't need prior access to the system or any specific privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to distribute the malicious crafted URL to potential victims (e.g. through emails, social media, etc.)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable versions are Episerver Find 13.2.6 and below.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 13.2.7.
- The vulnerability is located in the `Index` action of the `Click` controller (`EPiServer.Find.UI.Controllers.ClickController.Index()`).
- The fix involved sanitizing user input before redirection
