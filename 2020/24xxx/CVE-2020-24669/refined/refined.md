Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It occurs because user-supplied input, specifically the "Analysis Report Description" field in the "About this Report" section of Pentaho's New Analysis Report, is not properly sanitized or encoded before being rendered in the web page's Document Object Model (DOM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to DOM XSS because it uses unsanitized user input to modify the DOM of the webpage, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Code Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive data
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Analysis Report Description" field in the "About this Report" section within the Pentaho New Analysis Report functionality. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into this field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Pentaho application to be able to access and modify the vulnerable "Analysis Report Description" field.
- User Interaction:  An attacker must be able to create/edit a report to insert the malicious script and the victim needs to view the report for the script to be executed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Pentaho versions 7.x - 8.x
- The vulnerability is fixed in Pentaho versions 8.3.0.9 and later, 9.0.0.1 and later and 9.1.0.0 GA and later.
- The provided CVSS scores highlight the low impact of this issue for the confidentiality and integrity of data but has a low availability impact.
