Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-24654:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Ark's improper handling of symbolic links within TAR archive files. Specifically, Ark did not sanitize extraction paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink Vulnerability:**  A maliciously crafted TAR archive containing symlink entries could, during extraction, write files to locations outside of the intended extraction directory. This occurs because Ark fails to properly validate symlinks within the archive.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows for path traversal exploits by using symlinks to reach locations outside of the destination directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite existing files on the user's system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting configuration files like `.bashrc` or placing malicious scripts in autostart directories (`~/.config/autostart`), attackers could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Ark.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Though less frequently mentioned, the potential for denial of service through malicious file operations is also a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious TAR Archive:** An attacker crafts a specially designed TAR archive containing malicious symlinks.
- **User Interaction:** The victim is enticed or tricked into opening the malicious TAR archive using Ark. This could happen by downloading such an archive from the web, receiving it as an email attachment or other forms of file transfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Archives:** The attacker must be able to create a TAR archive file that contains specially crafted symlinks.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs some way to persuade the victim to open the malicious archive file.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves implementing the `ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_SECURE_SYMLINKS` option within the libarchive library used by Ark. This option ensures that each component of the target path is checked for symlinks before writing.
- The affected versions are `ark <= 20.08.0`.  The fix was released in `ark 20.08.1` and later.
- Patches for previous releases are available by backporting  commit [8bf8c5ef07b0ac5e914d752681e470dea403a5bd](https://invent.kde.org/utilities/ark/-/commit/8bf8c5ef07b0ac5e914d752681e470dea403a5bd) from the KDE git repository.

The provided content also indicates that various Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, and Gentoo, have released security updates to address this vulnerability.
