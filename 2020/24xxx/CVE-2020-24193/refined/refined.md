Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-24193:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection vulnerability present in the login functionality of the Daily Tracker System version 1.0. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `email` field before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the login process. The `email` parameter in the login form is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Data Exposure:** A successful SQL injection attack could also allow the attacker to potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page (`index.php`) with a malicious SQL payload in the `email` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the application's login page.
- **Knowledge of SQL syntax:** The attacker must be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the appropriate injection payload.
- **Ability to intercept/modify HTTP requests:** While not explicitly required, intercepting/modifying the request can help in ensuring the payload is properly sent to the server.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code snippet demonstrates how an attacker can use SQL injection to bypass authentication. By using the payload `email='+or+1%3d1+--+hyd3sec`, the attacker is able to modify the SQL query to always return a result, thus bypassing the password check.

**Vulnerable code snippet:**
```php
if(isset($_POST['login']))
{
    $email=$_POST['email'];
    $password=md5($_POST['password']);
    $query=mysqli_query($con,"select ID from tbluser where  Email='$email' && Password='$password    ' ");
    $ret=mysqli_fetch_array($query);
    if($ret>0){
        $_SESSION['detsuid']=$ret['ID'];
        header('location:dashboard.php');
    }
    else{
        $msg="Invalid Details.";
    }
}
```
The vulnerability exists because the `$email` variable taken from the POST request is inserted directly into the SQL query without any sanitization.
