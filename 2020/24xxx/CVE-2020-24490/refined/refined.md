Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-24490:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper buffer restrictions within the BlueZ software.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper buffer restrictions.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is adjacent access, meaning the attacker needs to be within the same network/local proximity (e.g. Bluetooth range).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated (unauthenticated user), but must be within the range to establish adjacent access. The attack has a high complexity.

**Summary of CVE-2020-24490:**

The vulnerability in BlueZ, identified as CVE-2020-24490, is due to improper buffer restrictions. This allows an unauthenticated attacker with adjacent access to potentially cause a denial of service (DoS). The attack is of medium severity, with high attack complexity.
