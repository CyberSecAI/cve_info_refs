The provided content describes three Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the ponzu CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. Specifically, the following endpoints are vulnerable:
    - `/admin/configure/users`: Adding a new admin user.
    - `/admin/configure/users/delete`: Deleting an admin user.
    - `/admin/configure`: Editing system configurations

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
    - Add a new administrator account, granting them full access to the system.
    - Delete existing administrator accounts, potentially locking out legitimate users.
    - Modify system configurations, including:
        - Changing HTTP Basic Auth credentials for backup access.
        - Changing the administrator email which might be used in conjunction with the add_admin vulnerability.
        - Changing client secret, compromising API validation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts malicious HTML forms (provided in the issue description) and tricks an authenticated administrator into submitting them. This can be done through various methods, such as:
    - Embedding the malicious form in a website or email.
    - Using a compromised website.
    - Social engineering attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to:
    - Have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameters.
    - Be able to induce a logged-in administrator to visit their crafted malicious page.
    - The administrator has to be logged into the vulnerable application for the attack to work.
