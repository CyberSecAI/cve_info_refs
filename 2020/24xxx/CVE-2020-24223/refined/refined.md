- The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking the malicious link (e.g. via email or other social engineering means).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `theme` parameter of `contact.php` .
- The attacker needs to convince an authenticated user to access the malicious URL.
