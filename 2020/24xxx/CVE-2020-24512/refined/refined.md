Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-24512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an observable timing discrepancy in some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Discrepancy:** The core issue is that the timing of certain operations within the processor can be observed, creating a side-channel that can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the affected machine.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** The attack is classified as having a high complexity.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **NetApp:** According to the NetApp advisory, CVE-2020-24512 has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 2.8 (Low) and is described as having a "Low" impact on their products..
*   **Intel:** Intel's advisory also mentions that this vulnerability is related to timing discrepancies and information disclosure via local access.
*   **Siemens:** Siemens lists this CVE as affecting various industrial products, requiring BIOS updates as mitigations.
*   **Debian:** Debian mentions this CVE as part of a larger intel-microcode security update, that aims to fix privilege escalation via side-channel attacks.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation for this vulnerability is updating the CPU microcode.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects various Intel processors. Specific lists of affected products are provided by NetApp and Siemens.

In summary, CVE-2020-24512 is a side-channel vulnerability stemming from observable timing differences in Intel processors, which can be exploited by a local authenticated user to disclose sensitive information.
