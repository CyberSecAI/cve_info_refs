Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24660:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that Nginx, unlike Apache, does not normalize the `REQUEST_URI` variable. This means that the LemonLDAP::NG handler, which uses regular expressions to enforce access rules, can be bypassed by using URL encodings or path traversal techniques. The handler tests regexp against the `REQUEST_URI` variable, so unnormalized URLs can bypass these checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of URL Normalization:** Nginx does not normalize the `REQUEST_URI`, allowing attackers to manipulate URLs in ways that bypass the intended access control mechanisms.
- **Reliance on `REQUEST_URI` for Access Control:** The LemonLDAP::NG handler relies on the `REQUEST_URI` variable for access control decisions, making it susceptible to bypass via URL manipulation.
- **Inadequate Regular Expressions:** It is difficult to write regular expressions that correctly catch all possible URL variations that target a protected resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to protected resources by manipulating URLs to circumvent the access rules defined by the LemonLDAP::NG handler.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, as demonstrated by the ability to access `/admin/secretfile`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the "skip" keyword is not used, a normal user can gain access to admin-only resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Encoding:** Attackers can use URL encoding (e.g., `%61dmin`) to represent characters in the URL, which can bypass regular expression checks.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use path traversal techniques (e.g., `x/../admin/secretfile`) to navigate to protected resources through unexpected paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running Nginx and LemonLDAP::NG.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or authorization to exploit this vulnerability. They just need to send crafted requests to the server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects LemonLDAP::NG version 2.0.8, but it also affects the node-lemonldap-ng-handler npm package < 0.5.1.
- The issue is specific to setups using Nginx web server.
-  The fix in node-lemonldap-ng-handler version 0.5.2 includes URL normalization.

**Remediation:**
- The suggested solution is to normalize the URL before the access control check occurs. This can be done either in the LemonLDAP::NG handler itself using a library like URI::Normalize, or by configuring Nginx to normalize the URL before passing it to the handler.

- Debian has addressed this issue in `lemonldap-ng` version `2.0.2+ds-7+deb10u5`.

- The `node-lemonldap-ng-handler` npm package has been patched in version 0.5.2.
