Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **First XSS:** The vulnerability lies in the "Question and answer module," specifically the "Question supplement function," which improperly sanitizes user-supplied input when inserting links.
*   **Second XSS:** The "online submission module" doesn't sanitize user-provided titles, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Both vulnerabilities are stored XSS, meaning the malicious scripts are saved in the application's database and are executed when a user views the affected content.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs in both the question supplement link field and the online submission title field.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **First XSS:** Any visitor who views a question containing the malicious link will trigger the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Second XSS:**  The administrator will trigger the XSS vulnerability when viewing the content management page after approving a malicious submission.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **First XSS:** An attacker injects the malicious payload `> < SVG / onload = alert ('xss') > <! --` into the "address" field when adding a link in the question supplement section.
*   **Second XSS:** An attacker injects the malicious payload `<script>alert (1)</script>` into the title field of the online submission module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **First XSS:** The attacker must be able to submit a question with a link in the supplement section. No authentication is required
*   **Second XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to submit content through the online submission module. After submission, an admin must approve the content and then view the admin content page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerable software is CmsWing version 1.3.7.
*   The first XSS can be triggered by any visitor.
*   The second XSS is triggered when the administrator opens the content management page after approving a malicious submission.
*   The provided screenshots show the specific locations where the vulnerabilities exist.
