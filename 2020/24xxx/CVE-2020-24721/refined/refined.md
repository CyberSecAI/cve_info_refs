  "CVE-2020-24721": {
    "Description": "The Corona/COVID-19 Exposure Notifications API allows for the decentralised, highly (pseudo)anonymous notification of exposure to people that were considered infectious in a certain period of time. The vulnerability lies in the fact that when a match is made and reported by the framework, the RPI that made that match is not deleted from the private store of the OS/Framework. This allows an attacker to force a user to 'prove' whether they had a notification by having them delete and reinstall the app.",
    "Root cause": "The Exposure Notifications API does not delete the RPI (Rolling Proximity Identifier) after a match is reported and the user dismisses the notification or deletes the app. The RPI remains stored in a closed part of the OS (iOS or Android) private frameworks, which the app has no control over.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Data retention: RPI data persists even after the user clears the app's data or uninstalls the app.",
        "Lack of user control: Users cannot directly clear the stored RPI data.",
      "Coercion vulnerability: The persistent data allows an attacker to force a user to reveal notification history."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with physical access to the user's device and coercion powers can force a user to prove whether they had received an exposure notification. The attacker can force the user to delete and reinstall the app and observe if a notification reappears, revealing their notification history. This impacts user privacy and could lead to discrimination or other adverse consequences for the user.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Physical access to the device",
        "Coercion of the user to delete and reinstall the app",
	  "Manipulation of app data"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Physical access to the target's device",
        "Ability to coerce the user to perform actions on their device (e.g., deleting and reinstalling the app)",
	 "Basic understanding of how the exposure notification app functions."
    ],
	"Additional details": "The vulnerability exists in both Android and iOS implementations of the Exposure Notifications API. The report includes a timeline of discovery and reporting the issue to Google and Apple. The CVSS score is 5.9 with a vector of AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:H/RL:U/RC:C/CR:H/IR:L AR:L/MAV:P/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:H/MI:N/MA:N. The vulnerability was found during the development of the Dutch 'Corona Melder' app."
