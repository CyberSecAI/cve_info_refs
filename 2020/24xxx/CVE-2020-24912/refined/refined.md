Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of SQL output in the `profile.php` file of the QCubed framework. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page by manipulating the `stQuery` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** The XSS vulnerability is leveraged through a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-24913) which allows tampering with the SQL output, facilitating XSS injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An unauthenticated attacker can steal sessions of authenticated users by injecting malicious JavaScript that can capture session cookies or other sensitive information.
*  **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `stQuery` parameter in the `profile.php` file.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target web application.
*   **Ability to craft malicious HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with a malicious payload in the `stQuery` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in all versions of QCubed framework including version 3.1.1.
* The provided proof of concept shows how an attacker can inject a JavaScript alert using a specially crafted SQL query.
*  The payload is injected into the `stQuery` parameter which is not sanitized, resulting in reflected XSS.
* The provided payload (unencoded) is :
```
a:1:{i:0;a:3:{s:12:"objBacktrace";a:1:{s:4:"args";a:1:{i:0;s:3:"PWN";}}s:8:"strQuery";s:112:"select version(); select
convert_from(decode($$PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgneHNzJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K$$,$$base64$$),$$utf-8$$)";s:11:"dblTimeInfo";s:1:"1";}}
```
* The XSS payload used is `<script>alert('xss')</script>` which is base64 encoded within the above payload.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor released a patch that allows disabling the profile functionality, which prevents the injection of malicious code through the vulnerable parameter.
