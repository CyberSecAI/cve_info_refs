Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `LibRaw::parseHassyModel` function, specifically when copying data using `strcpy`. This occurs when processing specially crafted image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking. If the source data is larger than the destination buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate the size of the data it is copying into the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker could overwrite parts of the stack and potentially execute their own code with the privileges of the process using the LibRaw library.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, a buffer overflow can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted image file that is designed to trigger the buffer overflow when processed by the LibRaw library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker could be remote as they need to entice the user to open a specially crafted image file using an application that uses the vulnerable LibRaw library.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Data:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an image file in a way that triggers the buffer overflow when processed by the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided stack trace confirms the buffer overflow during the `strcpy` operation in `LibRaw::parseHassyModel`.
*   The specific vulnerable function and code location (`strcpy` in `hasselblad_model.cpp:136`) are given.
*   The issue was reported on GitHub with a proof-of-concept (POC) file.
*   The issue is related to processing RAW image files from digital cameras, which is the core functionality of the LibRaw library.
