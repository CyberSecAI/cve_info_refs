Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-24570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues within the `com_mb24proxy` module of the mbCONNECT24 and mymbCONNECT24 software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources on behalf of the server.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to induce a logged-in user's browser to perform unwanted actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By exploiting these vulnerabilities together, an attacker can craft a specific malicious link. When a logged-in user clicks this link, the attacker can potentially steal session information. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the user and gain access to the application with the user's privileges, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious link.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a logged-in user to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to click the malicious link.
