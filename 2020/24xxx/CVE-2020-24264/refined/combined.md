## Description

![@ncresswell](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23178133?u=dc3376a5c5262cac1c52c976462503e6126b2f65&v=4&size=48)[ncresswell](https://github.com/ncresswell)opened [on Jul 27, 2020](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/4106#issue-665956241)

Right now we allow the Portainer administrator to "disable the use of bind mounts by non-admins", which is purely a front-end restriction, and is more of a "hide the capability". This feature stops using from selecting to use bind mounts in the container / service creation views, and stops the use of bind mounts when writing stacks. However, if a skilled user was to craft an API request to Portainer that included bind mounts, it would succeed as there is no backend enforcement.

To ensure security, we should enforce this restriction via the backend so that it cannot be used through the Portainer API.
