{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially stealing cookie-based authentication credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted URL with malicious script injected into the 'Referrer' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create and distribute the malicious URL to the victim, and the victim needs to click the URL for the exploit to execute. The attacker does not need prior authentication."
