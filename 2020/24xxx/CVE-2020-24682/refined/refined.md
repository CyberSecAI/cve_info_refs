- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unquoted service path in B&R Automation Studio and PVI Windows services (BrDiskImageSvcx and PviManSvcx).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the entire Windows operating system and its data.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker with access to the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated local access to the system. The attacker needs to insert malicious code into the unquoted service path.
