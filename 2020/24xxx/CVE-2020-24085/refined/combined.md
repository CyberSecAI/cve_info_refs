```
- the previous fix to the xss in the homepage setter was lacking the controller changes due to a partial commit (#bf4610c947c7dc372c4078f363d2dff6ae0703a8)

  - as originally discovered by Mislav Božičević <mislav.bozicevic@nn.cz>
  - persistence of the vulnerability after the lacking fix reported by DIEGO JURADO PALLARES from Ciberinteligencia
