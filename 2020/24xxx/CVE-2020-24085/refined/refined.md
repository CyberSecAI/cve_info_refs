The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository related to a fix for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient sanitization/validation when setting the homepage via the `setHomePage` function in the `UserSettingsController`. Specifically, the `path` parameter was not being properly handled when setting the homepage which can lead to XSS.
- The initial fix was incomplete, missing changes to the controller. This commit addresses the missing controller changes

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of the homepage path before storing in database and displaying it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send a malicious payload in the `path` parameter of the POST request to the `setHomePage` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to set the home page.
