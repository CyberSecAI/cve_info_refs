Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24876:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded encryption key ("SET-THIS-KEY") used in Pancake application versions prior to 4.13.29. This key was used to generate an MD5 hash for session cookies, which was the only mechanism preventing cookie manipulation. Since the key was the same across multiple installations and not updated by users, it allowed attackers to forge valid session cookies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hardcoded secret:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a hardcoded encryption key. This is a major security flaw as it's easily discoverable if the source code is exposed.
*   **Insufficient session validation:** The application relied solely on an MD5 hash of the serialized session data with a static key. This is insufficient because with the static key, anyone can create valid hashes.
*   **Lack of unique key generation:** The application did not enforce or provide a mechanism for users to generate a unique encryption key during installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** By forging a valid session cookie, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to any Pancake account, including administrative accounts, leading to complete control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Cookie forging:** An attacker who knows the hardcoded encryption key can construct a valid session cookie by serializing a PHP object, calculating the correct hash and setting this as cookie value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Knowledge of the hardcoded key:** The attacker must have knowledge of the hardcoded encryption key. This was obtainable by finding old versions of the source code.
*   **Ability to generate session data**: The attacker must be able to generate a serialized PHP object representing session data.
*   **Ability to set a cookie:** The attacker must be able to send a forged cookie to the web server.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a black box pentest.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Pancake before 4.13.29
*   The issue was fixed in version 4.13.29 by:
    *   Generating a unique encryption key based on a random value and storing it in the database.
    *  Adding a check in session library to remove any key which is not related to "session_id", "ip_address", "user_agent", "last_activity".
*   The content provides a PHP exploit code to generate a cookie given the session data, and the hardcoded key.
