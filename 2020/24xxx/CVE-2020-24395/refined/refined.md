Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insufficient verification of data authenticity during the firmware update process of the homee Brain Cube (Core) v2. Specifically, the update scripts and the "rootfs" (root file system) were not checked for a valid signature before installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Signature Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a digital signature verification process for the firmware update files. This allowed an attacker to replace legitimate firmware components with modified ones.
- **Insecure Update Process:** The update mechanism relied on copying an update script to a specific location (/data/update.scr) and executing it, without any verification that this script was genuine and unmodified.
- **USB access:** The device's export partition being directly accessible via USB provides an easy attack vector to drop modified firmware files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Device Control:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability gains complete control over the homee Brain Cube.
- **Malicious Firmware Installation:**  By flashing a modified firmware, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device, potentially leading to further malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, denial of service, or manipulation of the smart home environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access via USB:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the device. The attacker connects to the device via USB to access the export partition.
- **Modified Firmware:** The attacker modifies the firmware update by replacing the update script and "rootfs" within a firmware image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the homee Brain Cube to connect via USB.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires sufficient knowledge to modify firmware images, including the ability to use hex editors, and possibly repackage UBIFS images.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.29 of the homee Core software.
- The advisory provides a detailed timeline of the vulnerability discovery, reporting, and patching process.
- The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The device mounts the export partition via USB, allowing direct file system access.
- The advisory is provided by SySS GmbH, which discovered the vulnerability.
