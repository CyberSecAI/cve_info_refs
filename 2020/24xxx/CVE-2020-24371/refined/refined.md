{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-24371",
    "description": "Barriers cannot be active during sweep, even in generational mode. The colors of objects are being changed during sweep and, therefore, cannot be trusted.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The garbage collector barrier was being triggered during the sweep phase of the generational garbage collector, when object colors were unreliable. This is due to the fact that colors of objects are changed during sweep and therefore cannot be trusted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect garbage collection logic",
        "Race condition"
      ],
      "impact": "Potential memory corruption or access violation when the barrier is triggered during the sweep phase of the generational garbage collector.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploiting specific conditions that trigger garbage collection",
        "Creating objects and manipulating their references during generational garbage collection to trigger the vulnerable code"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to influence the execution flow of a Lua program. This likely means controlling the Lua code itself.",
	  "affected_components": ["lgc.c (barrier function)"]
    }
