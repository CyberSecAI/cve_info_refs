Pretty basic features, but a little clunky to use for what it does. Not a lot of options. There are better poll plugins out there.

### [It’s a great poll plugin!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/its-a-great-poll-plugin/)

This plugin does what it says it can do. You can easily create polls and embed them via widget or shortcodes. The poll looks basic, but it can be easily styled.
Polls can be set to run for specific durations, and you can have multiple polls.
The back end really shines with user statistics and poll statistics displayed as a graph.
The only problem I encountered was the questions appears squished into a table cell 100px wide instead of the full sidebar width. I added a CSS style to fix this and now it’s perfect.
Overall I am happy with it. I wish the author would make a proper ICON for his Wordpress.org listing!! The one you have in there right now is generic and does not catch people’s attention. Your plugin deserves more recognition and downloads, so make it stand out!

### [Easy, works and supports one vote per user](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/easy-works-and-supports-one-vote-per-user/)

I was looking for a poll which supports one vote per Wordpress User. This is the only poll I found and it works easy and out of the box.
I may be shown in a widget or called from a post by a special code. Only minor disadvantage is that it may not be called from bbPress forum plugin.
