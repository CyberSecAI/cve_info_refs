- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly control the paths it searches for resources, allowing an attacker to potentially influence the search path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is related to how the application searches for resources (path), but the specific vector is not described in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the search path to place a malicious file. The specific way to do this is not provided in the document.
