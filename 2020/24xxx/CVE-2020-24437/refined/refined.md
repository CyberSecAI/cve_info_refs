Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24437

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability triggered by improper handling of `Format` event actions attached to form fields in PDF documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-after-free:** The vulnerability occurs when a form field object is freed, but a stale reference to the object is retained. Subsequent access to this stale reference results in the use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully manipulating memory after the object is freed but before it's reused, an attacker can gain control of the freed memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious PDF:** A specially crafted PDF document with embedded malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** A user could be tricked into visiting a malicious web page that renders a PDF using the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create a malicious PDF file:** An attacker needs to embed specific Javascript code within a PDF file.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious website.
*   **Knowledge of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC's internal workings:** While not strictly necessary, understanding how the form fields and event handlers operate can help to reliably trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a `Format` event action is attached to a text field. The action handler deletes pages, freeing the memory of the text field object, but a reference to the freed memory is still in use. When the same object is accessed later inside the event handler, it results in a use-after-free condition.
*   The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability. The javascript code first creates a template of the document, then sets the action of a text field's Format event to delete a page. The template is used to generate additional pages. Finally the form is reset, which triggers the Format event, and the code within the event handler is executed, resulting in the UAF.
*   The vulnerability can be observed in a debugger, where the breakpoints demonstrate how the object is freed and later reused leading to a crash.

**Additional Notes**
* This vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader, including the DC (Continuous and Classic) and 2017 versions.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
