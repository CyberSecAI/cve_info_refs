Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Export to PDF" functionality in MicroStrategy's business analytics software. The application uses a headless browser (Chromium v65) to render and convert dashboards into PDF files. This process allows for the execution of JavaScript code injected into the dashboards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows users to insert arbitrary HTML code, including JavaScript, when editing dashboards. This is a feature for customization, but it lacked proper input validation, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities.
2.  **Blind XSS:** The injected JavaScript code executes within the context of the headless browser on the server, leading to Blind XSS.
3. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, attackers can manipulate the headless browser to make requests to arbitrary domains, including internal resources. This is achieved by injecting an iframe tag within the dashboard and exporting the dashboard to a PDF. This can be used to access local files on the server via `file:///` URI scheme.
4.  **Exposed AWS Instance Metadata:** Attackers can use the SSRF vulnerability to access the AWS instance metadata service, which is normally only accessible to software running on the instance. This service exposes access keys and other sensitive information used for the infrastructure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Information Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive information like local files, and potentially configuration files, from the server.
2.  **Compromised Cloud Infrastructure:** Attackers can obtain AWS access keys through the instance metadata, enabling them to potentially gain unauthorized access to the cloud environment.
3.  **Internal Network Access:** Attackers can use the SSRF vulnerability as a pivot point into the internal network.
4.  **Further Compromise:** Attackers can perform lateral movement and escalate privileges within the organization by leveraging the access gained.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **XSS via Dashboard Editing:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a dashboard.
2.  **PDF Export:** The attacker exports the compromised dashboard to a PDF file. This triggers the malicious JavaScript in the headless browser on the server.
3. **SSRF via iFrame:** The injected javascript makes requests to internal network resources via an iframe tag, allowing an attacker to read them.
4.  **Metadata Access:** The SSRF is used to access the AWS metadata service, exposing sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Access to MicroStrategy Application:** An attacker needs access to the MicroStrategy application, with the ability to edit and create dashboards.
2. **Knowledge of XSS:** Understanding of XSS vulnerabilities to craft malicious payloads.
3. **Understanding of SSRF:** Understanding of SSRF vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
4.  **Awareness of AWS Metadata Service:** Knowledge of how to access the AWS metadata service to extract sensitive information, such as access keys.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test by Triskele Labs.
*   MicroStrategy has acknowledged and addressed the vulnerability in newer versions by implementing a whitelisting facility to mitigate SSRF.
*   The recommended remediation is to upgrade to the latest version of the MicroStrategy platform.
* The vulnerability highlights the risks associated with overlooking seemingly innocuous functions, especially those that interact with other services within the infrastructure.
