## Don't let data slow you down

Business intelligence is changing fast. Those who succeed need to make confident decisions and act quickly, but it's challenging when:

![Image](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb564490bc5201f31/blt78aa15925d83874d/6628b11aca88741caeed3c09/frontline-workers-icon.svg?format=webp)

**Users can't find the right data**

**Applications are disconnected**

**Data analysis tools too complex**

**Increasing integration costs and no return**

## Interact with data in a human way

Get fast, easy-to-understand insights where and when you need them.

Businesses are drowning in data, spreadsheets and dashboards, but none of it helps the front line move ahead.

Thatâ€™s why we were the first to integrate AI technology into our trusted BI platform, MicroStrategy ONE.Â We make it easy for everyday users to find the information they need, where and when they need it.

**And your organization will experience:**

## Redefine how intelligence data gets delivered

Get relevant, instant suggestions and predictions that help users make confident decisions quickly.

**MicroStrategy AI**

Information is only valuable if you can get it into the hands of the people who need it ***quickly***. Auto integrates AI technology at every level of your organization so that:

* **Data visualization is convenient and easy to interact with**
* **Less time is wasted building more data modeling dashboards and reports**
* **Users can ask deeper questions using natural language**
* **Time to action is accelerated**

# Extracting your AWS Access Keys through a PDF file

Share

**MicroStrategy SSRF through PDF Generator (CVE-2020-24815)**

The Portable Document Format (PDF) was first developed in 1993 and since then, PDF filesÂ haveÂ gained widespread adoption, becoming theÂ de factoÂ standardÂ forÂ documentÂ publishing.Â It wasÂ onlyÂ natural that developers followedÂ the trendingÂ popularityÂ and nowadays it is common for applications to allow you to export documents to a PDF file. At firstÂ glance, thisÂ functionalityÂ may seem harmless;Â somethingÂ whichÂ youÂ might not spareÂ tooÂ much thought. This mentalityÂ often leads to security flawsÂ inÂ applicationsÂ withÂ hackersÂ focusingÂ their attentionÂ on overlookedÂ components and functionality.

In this post, we will show howÂ aÂ seeminglyÂ innocuous "Export to PDF" functionÂ canÂ be an open door to your organisation's internal network and howÂ itÂ can be used to extract sensitive information, including access keys to your organisation's cloud infrastructure. We will present the results from a recent penetration test performed by Triskele Labs, which lead to the identification of multiple vulnerabilities in a popular business analytics software.Â OneÂ of these vulnerabilities was first identified by Triskele Labs and was assigned CVE-2020-24815.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

In a recent penetration test, Triskele Labs was taskedÂ withÂ testing a popular business analytics applicationÂ createdÂ by MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy isÂ aÂ NASDAQ listed company offering a rangeÂ of analytics software since 1989 for organisationsÂ such asÂ Facebook and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).

During testing the team observed the application allowed the insertion of arbitrary HTML code when editing dashboards (also known as dossiers). This was not a flaw but indeed a feature of the application to allow the customisation of dashboards. HTML codeÂ editorsÂ often lack strict validation of user inputÂ as this is a non-trivial task.Â As such,Â these editorsÂ usually allow the insertion of arbitrary code including JavaScript. This often leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. In fact, this part of the application was affected by a known stored XSS vulnerability [1].

XSS Execution

**Taking it further: Blind XSS**

At this point,Â we had a straight-forward stored XSS vulnerability in the application. SomeÂ might have stoppedÂ hereÂ and reported the issue, but we wanted toÂ explore the impactÂ further. We started to analyse other parts of the application and one feature thatÂ caughtÂ our attention was the "Export to PDF" function which allowed users to export a dashboard as a PDF file.

To load and convert a web page to a PDF file, developers often make use of headless browsersÂ such asÂ PhantomJS.Â InformationÂ leakage in metadataÂ isÂ often overlookedÂ and as such,Â a reliable source ofÂ information.Â By analysing the metadata of an exported PDF file, we discovered that the application was created by Chromium using theÂ Skia/PDF m65 graphics library. This indicated that the application was utilising Headless Chrome version 65 to render and convert the dashboard pages, potentially allowing the execution of JavaScript code.

PDF Metadata

The next step was to attempt to trigger the execution of XSS payloads within the headless browser used by the PDF generation service. Since the conversion occurs on the server, we had no visibilityÂ ofÂ theÂ immediateÂ execution of the payloads, and thereforeÂ had to use a blind XSS payload which would alert the team when triggered. Soon after injecting the payload into a dashboard and exporting it as a PDF file, we received a notification that our payload executed successfully. This demonstrated that we could execute JavaScript code under the context of the headless browser located in the server.

Blind XSS Execution

**Taking it even further: XSS to SSRF**

In essence, theÂ successfulÂ execution of our XSS payloadÂ impliedÂ that we had some control over a browser located inside the organisation's internal network. As such, we could manipulate the browser to requestÂ arbitraryÂ restrictedÂ resourcesÂ which would beÂ unreachableÂ by outside users. This is known as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

SSRFÂ vulnerabilitiesÂ occur when an attackerÂ canÂ manipulate an application to make requests to arbitrary domains of the attacker's choosing. By itself, this does not represent a vulnerability as there are legitimate cases for allowing a user to define a resource to be fetched by an application, like loading a profile picture fromÂ aÂ given URL.Â However,Â SSRF becomes a problem when an attackerÂ canÂ exploit this behaviour to access restricted web-based services. Although SSRFsÂ issuesÂ have been known for a while, the vulnerability has gained considerable attention in the past few years. A recent caseÂ involvedÂ Facebook paying a $30,000 bounty forÂ anÂ SSRF vulnerability [2] [3], also affectingÂ aÂ componentÂ of aÂ MicroStrategy application.

In our case, as the application was allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML code, the first step was to attempt loadingÂ restricted resourcesÂ by simply using anÂ iFrameÂ tag. In fact, by injecting anÂ iFrameÂ tag in a dashboard andÂ exporting this intoÂ a PDF document, it was possible to extract the contents of local filesÂ residing onÂ the server.Â For example, the following payload was used to read the contents of theÂ host'sÂ file.

<iframeÂ src=file:///C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\hosts>

![Graphical user interface, text, application</p>

Hosts File from Local System

**Taking it much further: the Keys to****the****Cloud Infrastructure**

At this point,Â weÂ successfullyÂ demonstrated that we could access restricted data by using the PDF generation function. The next step was toÂ gainÂ accessÂ to even more sensitive information. As the application was hosted in AWS,Â an idea formed thatÂ theÂ instance metadataÂ could be accessible.

The metadata service provides information that aids the configuration and management of running instances.Â One of the solutions provided by theÂ service is thatÂ it eliminatesÂ the need for hardcoding or distribution of sensitive credentials.Â TheÂ metadata is attached locally to everyÂ instance through a local IP address (169.254.169.254) which means that only software running on the instance can access itÂ [4], much like our PDF generation service.

OnceÂ again,Â we inserted an iframe tagÂ into the dashboard,Â butÂ this time pointing to the instance metadataÂ located atÂ *http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/*. After exporting the dashboard to a PDF document, we found that the applicationÂ successfullyÂ loaded and rendered the metadata information within the exported file. More surprisingly,Â the teamÂ discoveredÂ access keys for an AWS account by further analysing the information stored within the metadata. This wasÂ aÂ similar scenario to whatÂ occurredÂ in the CapitalOne breach [5].

Access Keys from Instance Metadata

**Responsible****Disclosure & Remediation**

Upon discovering the issue, Triskele Labs immediately reported the vulnerability toÂ theÂ MicroStrategy team. MicroStrategy promptly replied that they were aware of the issue and that it had been resolved in recent versions of the platform. MicroStrategy stated that in the newest versions, "a new whitelisting facility was developed to mitigate the SSRF vulnerability" [6]. As such,Â the officialÂ MicroStrategy recommendationÂ isÂ for customers to upgrade to the latest version of the MicroStrategy platform. MicroStrategy also provided a reward under their bug bounty program,Â since the vulnerability affected supported versions of the application.

**Conclusion**

In summary,Â be careful toÂ underestimate inconspicuous functions in your applications,Â asÂ hackers willÂ certainlyÂ focus their attention on the most overlookedÂ components.Â As these functions communicate with other services within an organisationâ€™s infrastructure, they canÂ oftenÂ beÂ affected by severe vulnerabilities like SSRF,Â which can becomeÂ anÂ open door to your organisation's internal resources and data. Therefore, ensure your applications are frequentlyÂ pentestedÂ by a reliable team. At Triskele Labs we incorporate novel techniques within our test framework, so you can restÂ assuredÂ that your applications are being tested for the latest vulnerabilities.
