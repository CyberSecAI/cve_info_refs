Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-24977:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A global buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `xmlEncodeEntitiesInternal` function within the libxml2 library. This occurs during XML entity encoding, specifically when using the `xmllint --htmlout` option.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow. This implies that a write operation exceeds the allocated size of a global buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Several sources mention a potential DoS via infinite loops or memory consumption. The global buffer overflow itself can also lead to a crash, resulting in denial of service.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Some advisories mention the possibility of sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Data Modification:** The vulnerability could allow addition or modification of data, according to some sources.
*  **Out-of-bounds read:** One source mentions an out-of-bounds read, specifically when using `xmllint --htmlout`, which can lead to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Documents:** The primary attack vector involves processing specially crafted XML documents with a vulnerable version of libxml2.
*   **`xmllint --htmlout` option:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by using the `xmllint` command with the `--htmlout` option when processing a crafted XML file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing a specially crafted XML file to a service using a vulnerable libxml2 library.
*   **No Privilege Required:** Exploitation of the vulnerability doesn't require any special user privileges, allowing anyone to potentially trigger the bug given the correct input.
*   **User Interaction:** Some exploits may require user interaction to trigger the vulnerable code path, like using the xmllint command.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by the Agency for Defense Development (ADD).
*   A fix was implemented in commit `50f06b3e` in the libxml2 project.
*   Many Linux distributions and products, including openSUSE, Fedora, and NetApp products, were found to be vulnerable.
*   Patches and updates were released to address the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-24977 is a moderate severity vulnerability affecting `libxml2`, where processing crafted XML content using the `--htmlout` option in `xmllint` leads to a global buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial of service or information disclosure. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, and it was addressed through patches and software updates.
