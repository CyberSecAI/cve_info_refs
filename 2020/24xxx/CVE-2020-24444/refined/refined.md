Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24444:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a security bulletin from Adobe (APSB20-72) that explicitly mentions CVE-2020-24444. This bulletin states:

> Blind server-side request forgery | Sensitive Information Disclosure | Important | CVE-2020-24444 | AEM Forms SP6 add-on for AEM 6.5.6.0 and earlier  AEM Forms add-on package for AEM 6.4 Service Pack 8 Cumulative Fix Pack 2 (6.4.8.2) and earlier

This confirms the content's direct relevance to CVE-2020-24444.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a "Blind server-side request forgery". The root cause is not detailed in the provided content but it points to a flaw in how AEM Forms add-on handles requests, allowing an attacker to potentially cause the server to make requests to an attacker-controlled destination.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to make the AEM server initiate requests to arbitrary URLs. The "blind" aspect means the attacker may not directly see the server's response, but they can still leverage the server to interact with internal services, potentially exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information. This could be achieved by making the vulnerable server request internal resources, or by making the server authenticate to other services, revealing confidential information in the process.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the AEM Forms add-on. Specifically, this impacts:
    -   AEM Forms Service Pack 6 add-on for AEM 6.5.6.0 and earlier
    -   AEM Forms add-on package for AEM 6.4 Service Pack 8 Cumulative Fix Pack 2 (6.4.8.2) and earlier

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted requests to the vulnerable AEM Forms add-on. This suggests the attack would likely originate from outside the server's internal network or from an attacker who has a foothold in the target network.
-   The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters or data that the AEM server uses to make requests.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The Adobe Security Bulletin (APSB20-72) categorizes this vulnerability as "Important" and assigns a severity rating of 2.
-   The bulletin mentions that updates have been released to address the vulnerability.
-   The bulletin credits Frank Karlstr√∏m and Kenny Jansson of Storebrand Group, Norway for reporting the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-24444 is a Blind SSRF vulnerability in AEM Forms add-on that could lead to sensitive information disclosure. It requires the attacker to be able to manipulate server-side request generation, and it was addressed by updates released in APSB20-72.
