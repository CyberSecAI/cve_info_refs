Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **weak service permissions** assigned to the `mRemoteNG.exe` executable. Specifically, the executable had modify permissions granted to authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that standard, authenticated users have the ability to modify the `mRemoteNG.exe` service binary.
*   **Weak Service Permissions:** The mRemoteNG service, running with SYSTEM privileges, can be modified by any authenticated user due to the overly permissive access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their privileges from a standard user to administrator/SYSTEM level.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By modifying the service binary, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where mRemoteNG is installed.
*   **Malicious Executable:** The attacker replaces the legitimate service executable with a malicious one

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Windows system.
*   **File System Access:**  The attacker needs write permissions to the `mRemoteNG.exe` file, typically located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\mRemoteNG\" by default.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in mRemoteNG v1.76.20.
*   The `icacls` command output shows that `BUILTIN\Users` have `(M)` modify permissions on the `mRemoteNG.exe` executable which is incorrect and allows privilege escalation.
*   The attacker can overwrite `mRemoteNG.exe` with a malicious executable. The next time the service starts the malicious code will be executed as SYSTEM.
*  The vulnerability is described as a local privilege escalation using windows service permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Thurein Soe.
*   A fix was released in mRemoteNG v1.76.20.24615, but it was not mentioned in the provided content.
*   The issue is tracked in GitHub issue #2338, and is labeled as "Cannot Fix" and "Cannot Reproduce" by the mRemoteNG team.
*   The advisory suggests that this is due to improperly set permissions on the executable.
*   The EPSS score is 0.044% (15th percentile), which suggests a low chance of exploitation, but this can be misleading for specific target installations.
