Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's servlet `capexweb.cap_sendMail` is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to improper handling of GET request parameters. Specifically, user-provided input (user ID in this case) is directly incorporated into SQL queries without sufficient sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user lists.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** They could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In certain scenarios, attackers might escalate their privileges to gain administrative rights to the database server.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request Parameters:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `user-id` parameter in the HTTP GET request sent to `servlet/capexweb.cap_sendMail` during the "Forgot Password" process.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Summary:**

The content provides a detailed description of a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-24600) affecting the CAPExWeb application. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in SQL queries, which can lead to a range of consequences, including data breaches and privilege escalation. The attack vector is through manipulating the "user-id" parameter within the "Forgot Password" functionality. The provided steps of how to exploit this vulnerability offer a detailed proof of concept (POC) and also include database error messages. The vendor, Shilpi, has fixed this vulnerability, and the content also includes the timeline from discovery to fix confirmation by CERT-in.
