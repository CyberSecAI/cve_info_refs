- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input in the `order`, `srt`, and arbitrary URL parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website, potentially stealing cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors:**  A specially crafted URL is used to inject malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. No special attacker position is required, only the ability to deliver the malicious URL to the victim.
