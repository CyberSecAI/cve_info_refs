The provided content is related to CVE-2020-24333.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An API in Arista CloudVision Portal (CVP) allows authenticated users with "read-only" or greater access to the Configlet Management module to download files located on the CVP server that they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the Configlet Management module, specifically in a specific API.
- Information disclosure: Users can access and download files on the CVP server beyond their intended access rights.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive files: Attackers could potentially gain access to configuration files, sensitive data, or other files stored on the CVP server.
- Data breach: The ability to download unintended files could lead to a data breach, with potential negative consequences depending on the files compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker needs to access the CVP server through the network.
- API access: The vulnerability is exploited via a specific API endpoint within CVP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "read-only" access to the Configlet Management module within CVP. This includes users with "network-operator" or "network-admin" roles, or a custom role with such access rights.
- Network connectivity: The attacker must have network access to the CVP server.
