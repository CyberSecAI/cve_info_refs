Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-24186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure file upload handling within the wpDiscuz plugin. Specifically, the plugin's file type verification process could be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Mime Type Detection:** The `getMimeType` function relied on methods that could be spoofed. The function would check the mime type using `mime_content_type` or `finfo_file`, which determine file types based on content. However, these functions are vulnerable to manipulation by prepending magic bytes of allowed file types (e.g. image magic bytes to a php file). If these checks were not available, then it would fallback to `wp_check_filetype`, which checks file type based on the file name against a built-in list of allowed file types.
- **Insufficient File Type Verification:** The `isAllowedFileType` function checked if the determined mime type was in the allowed list. Since the `getMimeType` function was easily bypassed, an attacker could spoof the mime type and pass this check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers could upload any file type, including PHP files, to the server.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and then accessing a PHP file, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Full Server Control:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected website and potentially all other sites hosted on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability was exploitable by unauthenticated users, meaning anyone could trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious upload request.
- **Bypassed File Type Checks:** Attackers could craft file uploads that spoofed mime types and bypassed the file type checks.
- **Direct File Access:** Uploaded files are stored with their path exposed, allowing attackers to directly access and execute them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication to the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Knowledge of File Upload Process:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and how to craft an upload request with manipulated file content (magic bytes).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected wpDiscuz plugin versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.4.
- The vulnerability was rated as critical with a CVSS score of 10.0.
- Wordfence's firewall protected both premium and free users against this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 7.0.5 of the plugin.
- The `Disable Code Execution for Uploads directory` option in Wordfence could provide additional protection against this kind of vulnerability.
