*   **Affected Versions:**  < TLM RP 3.1.0

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive information
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would need to inject the malicious JavaScript into a field or area of the application that stores data, which is then displayed to other users.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and inject the malicious script. This would likely require having an authenticated account, although the specific user privileges required are not clear from the provided data.
