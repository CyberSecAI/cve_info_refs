- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `dwarf::line_table::line_table` function within the `dwarf/line.cc` file at line 107.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code attempts to read data beyond the bounds of the `opcode_lengths` global variable, which is an array.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash (abort). The ASan report indicates a read of size 4 occurs out of the bounds of the `opcode_lengths` array. Additionally, the crash can be leveraged to potentially achieve a buffer overflow condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted ELF file that triggers the vulnerable code path in the `dwarf::line_table::line_table` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ELF file to the `dump-lines` example program to trigger the overflow in libelfin.
