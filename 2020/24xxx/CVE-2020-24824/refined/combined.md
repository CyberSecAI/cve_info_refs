## Description

![@xiaoxiongwang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48821972?u=c2953a843eb36275c37e07f8eafe2697ef97e463&v=4&size=48)[xiaoxiongwang](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang)opened [on Aug 15, 2020](https://github.com/aclements/libelfin/issues/48#issue-679569727)

Tested in Ubuntu 16.04, 64bit.

The tested program is the example program dump\_line.

The testcase is [dump\_line\_global\_buffer\_overflow](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang/function_bugs/blob/master/libelfin/dump_line_global_buffer_overflow).

I use the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-lines dump_line_global_buffer_overflow

```

and get:

```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'dwarf::format_error'
  what():  expected 858944595 arguments for line number opcode 16, got 2
--- <0>
Aborted (core dumped)

```

I use **valgrind** to analysis the bug and get the below information (absolute path information omitted):

```

I use **AddressSanitizer** to build ffjpeg and running it with the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-lines dump_line_global_buffer_overflow

```

This is the ASAN information (absolute path information omitted):

```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious elf file that exploits this bug which will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) even buffer overflow.
