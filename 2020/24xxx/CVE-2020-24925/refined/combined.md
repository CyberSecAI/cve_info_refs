   These are great insights. It was very informative. Although most browsers can be used for [Automated website testing](https://eiliana.com/blogitem/importance-of-choosing-the-best-javascript-automation-testing-platform) across platforms, Safari and IE are the biggest roadblocks because they are OS-specific. A Mac could have a few virtual machines that run Windows or Linux. Or just Windows, since Chrome and Firefox (clones) are the main browsers for Linux. This way, you don't need to create a new OS each time. If there are any problems with the VM, you can just kill it and start a fresh one.
