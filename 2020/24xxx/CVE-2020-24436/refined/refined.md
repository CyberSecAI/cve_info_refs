Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-24436:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the exporting of PDF files. This allows a write operation to occur past the end of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  The core issue is that the software allows writing data outside the allocated memory boundaries. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user's process. This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability. This implies a social engineering aspect to the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file or a malicious page that, when processed by the vulnerable software, triggers the out-of-bounds write.
*  The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious web page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
* The severity is rated as **Critical** in the Adobe Security Bulletin.
* The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating high severity with attack vector being local but requiring user interaction for successful exploitation.

This information aligns with the description of an out-of-bounds write leading to arbitrary code execution, and provides additional details about the attack vector and exploitation requirements not present in the original CVE description.
