- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application `FruityWifi <=v2.4` lacks CSRF protection in the `page_config_adv.php` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the `newSSID` and `hostapd_wpa_passphrase` values on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can lure a victim to visit a website containing a malicious HTML page. This page will then trigger a CSRF request to the legitimate server, which will cause a change of `newSSID` and `hostapd_wpa_passphrase` values as defined by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to create an HTML page containing a malicious request.
    - The attacker must be able to lure the victim to open this HTML page.
    - The attacker does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability
