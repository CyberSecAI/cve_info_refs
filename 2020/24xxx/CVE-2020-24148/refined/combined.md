## Description

Import content from any XML or RSS file or URL.

You can import the content to any post type in your WordPress install. You can also import taxonomies.

Our plugin is especailly useful for importing content from Wix websites.

### Step by Step process

* Select the source ( URL or FILE UPLOAD ).
* Select your repeated XML element you want to import – this should be the node in your XML file which will be considered a post upon import.
* Select the post type you want to import the content to.
* Match the fields from the XML node you’ve selected (step 2) to the corresponding fields you have available on the post type.

### Supported files and URLs

* The XML source file should be a valid XML file. [You can check your feed validation here.](https://validator.w3.org/feed/)
* JSON feeds needs to be first converted to RSS or XML file [using tools such as this.](https://www.convertjson.com/json-to-xml.htm)
* The plugin will then check if the URL source or the uploaded file is valid before the import and processing starts
* If you use URL source for import, please ensure the URL is not password protected
* Supported formats: XML 1.0, XML 2.0, Atom 1, RSS

### Features

* **XML Preview** – After successfully uploading an XML file or reading an external URL, the plugin will present you with an XML preview of the selected node. This can be used to check if you’ve selected the correct node and ensure that the data are read correctly by the plugin. The preview presents one item from the selected node but it is paginated so you can navigate back and forward between the elements.
* **Linking Taxonomies to Posts** – You can import categories and taxonomies from the XML file and link the imported posts to these taxonomies. First you need to have the taxonomies created in WordPress to allow the plugin to import into these taxonomies. By default WordPress has two taxonomies: categories and tags.
* **Limit posts** – In the “Import Settings” area you can set limits for the import. You can use multiple patterns to include posts in the import. Use semicolon to separate the values, for example: 1-8;10;14-
* **Importing and linking multiple taxonomies to one post** – To import and link one post to multiple taxonomies, you need to have an XML element in your selected node with a list of categories separated by commas. These elements will be recognized and imported separately as taxonomy terms.
* **Save & Load templates** – Once the fields are matched, you can save the matching as a template, and use it again for another import.
* **Support for tag attributes**
* **Custom Fields & ACF support**

It messes up sensitive data like publication dates or categories; doesn’t actually do anything with external media except creating blank database posts… The only upside is that it supports ACF.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Editing since i have tried different approach with it, for some reason the images downloads just fine on another hosting(same config) and dates needs to have proper format.
It still pretty much can’t synchronize categories but i can live with that.

It lets you map fields and the import went well.
It would be even more helpful if it allowed us to also map attributes, in case images are stored in the RSS feed as an attribute.
Thanks for your work!

I wanted to convert an RSS feed into posts. This plugin lets you precisely map how you want meta data imported and even integrates with Advanced Custom Fields.

After searching for and trying (without success) different ways to import posts from an old Wix website blog, this plugin finally saved me from pulling out my hair. The process was smooth, easy to follow, and worked exactly as I had hoped. I was able to import all Wix blog posts into my new WP site as posts, easily select which elements from the Wix blog corresponded to the WP blog elements (title, content, date, etc).
NOTE: This did not pull in the media (photos/graphics), but that has to do with Wix being protective of anything that might have been uploaded to their site builder. So I’ll still have to go back, save those images from Wix, then upload to the new WP site. But at least I didn’t have to retype everything from scratch.
