{
  "CVE-2020-24339": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The function in picoTCP and picoTCP-NG that processes DNS responses does not check whether the number of responses specified in the DNS packet header correspond to the response data available in the DNS packet, allowing an attacker to perform memory corruption.",
    "root_cause": "The function in picoTCP and picoTCP-NG that processes DNS responses does not check if the number of responses declared in the DNS packet header match the number of responses present in the DNS packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service, leak information or potentially execute arbitrary code due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send crafted DNS responses to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network packets to a vulnerable device running picoTCP or picoTCP-NG. No authentication is required.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in multiple open-source TCP/IP stacks commonly used in IoT and embedded devices, known as 'AMNESIA:33'. The lack of input validation on the number of DNS responses can lead to an out-of-bounds read during processing of DNS response packets."
