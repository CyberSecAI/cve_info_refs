Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24368:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-24368 and describes a directory traversal vulnerability in Icinga Web 2, aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how Icinga Web 2 handles requests for static image files. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the `file` parameter in the request, allowing an attacker to manipulate this parameter to access files outside the intended directory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw, also known as path traversal. This allows an attacker to use ".." sequences to navigate to parent directories.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper validation and sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `file` parameter in the request.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that are accessible to the process running Icinga Web 2 (typically the web server or PHP-FPM process). This could expose sensitive information, configuration files, source code, or other data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the `/static/img` endpoint of Icinga Web 2. The `module_name` and `file` parameters are used to exploit the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Icinga Web 2 instance.
*   **Knowledge of a Module:** The attacker must know the name and install path of an installed, non-core Icinga Web 2 module that serves static files. The attacker may try to discover vulnerable modules by trial and error.
*   **No User Authentication:**  A valid user login is NOT required to exploit this vulnerability

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerable endpoint is `/icingaweb2/static/img`.
*   The vulnerable parameters are `module_name` and `file`.
*   An example exploit URL: `GET /icingaweb2/static/img?module_name=businessprocess&file=../../../../../../../etc/os-release`

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability exists since the initial 2.0.0 stable release.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions: 2.0.0 through 2.6.4, 2.7.4 and 2.8.2
*   The issue is fixed in Icinga Web 2 versions 2.6.4, 2.7.4, and 2.8.2, and later.
*   Modules that might be leveraged:  businessprocess, director, reporting, map, globe.
*   Detection of attacks via access log analysis: `grep -Pie '(?<=GET|POST ).+/static/img?(.*file=((\.|%2e)(\.|%2e)(/|%2f)){3,}\S*| )' access.log`
