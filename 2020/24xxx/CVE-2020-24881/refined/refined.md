Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `src` attribute in `<img>` tags within user-submitted content. The application does not verify if the URL points to a valid image before making an HTTP request to it when a ticket is printed or when "Show Images" is clicked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is SSRF. The server can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs specified in the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to scan internal network resources.
*   **Access to Internal Services:** Attackers can potentially access internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Exfiltration of Data:** In some SSRF scenarios, the attacker can potentially exfiltrate internal data by sending it to a controlled server.
*   **Loading Malicious Code/Scripts:** Although the primary issue is SSRF, the original vulnerability could potentially also be used to load malicious code if the server fetches and executes the content of a malicious script using the `<img>` tag if the image validation is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker with access to the customer portal can submit a ticket reply that contains a malicious `<img>` tag with a `src` attribute pointing to a URL they control.
*   When the ticket is printed, or the "Show Images" option is used, the server will then make a request to the URL specified in the `src` attribute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the customer portal or have a way to submit a ticket reply.
*   They need to be able to post HTML content to the ticket system, which includes the use of the HTML editor.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The exploit is triggered by inserting an `<img>` tag with a malicious URL into a ticket reply using the HTML editor, then viewing the ticket using the "Print" button or "Show Images".
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of osTicket prior to the patch, specifically before version v1.14.2.
*   The fix involves adding a new setting called `Allow External Images`. When disabled, all external images are blocked and if enabled, the system will only allow `<img>` src URLs with valid image extensions (`png`,`jpg`,`jpeg`,`gif`).
*   The patch also involves changes to `class.config.php`, `class.format.php`, `class.thread.php`, `config.yaml`, `settings.ticket.yaml`, and `settings-tickets.inc.php`.
*   A GitHub user commented that the issue with SSRF is not about loading malicious scripts but about making a request from the server and that the filter is not robust.
