  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-24370",
  "description": "lua: segmentation fault in getlocal and setlocal functions in ldebug.c",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Negation overflow when accessing local variables in the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions of Lua's debugging library (`ldebug.c`). Specifically, when a large negative index is passed to these functions, it leads to a segmentation fault.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to segmentation fault, potentially crashing the application or service using the vulnerable Lua library.",
    "attack_vectors": "By calling the vulnerable `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions with specific large negative index values. For example, `getlocal(3, 2^31)`.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute Lua code and call the vulnerable `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "Lua 5.4.0 and prior versions"
   ],
  "patch_information": [
   "The vulnerability was fixed in Lua commit `a585eae6e7ada1ca9271607a4f48dfb17868ab7b`",
    "Patched versions of lua5.3: 5.3.3-1.1+deb10u1 (Debian 10), 5.3.3-1+deb9u1 (Debian 9), 5.3.5-8.fc31 (Fedora 31), 5.3.5-8.fc32 (Fedora 32)."
