Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PDF files within Adobe Illustrator. Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. This means the software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the allocated buffer, leading to a read past the end of an allocated structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This means the attacker can potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious PDF file.
*   **Malicious Page:** A user could be tricked into visiting a malicious page which could then trigger the vulnerability via an embedded malicious PDF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into either opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the exploit.
*   **Local Access:** The ZDI advisory indicates the attack vector is local, however, the adobe advisory notes that this vulnerability could be triggered by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page. Therefore, an attacker can also remotely exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as critical.
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Illustrator 2020 versions 24.2 and earlier on Windows.
*   Adobe has released an update (version 25.0) to address this vulnerability.
