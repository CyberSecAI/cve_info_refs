# Fossil version 2.12.1 - update recommended

### (1) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2020-08-20 14:50:04 [[source]](/forum/forumpost/a05ae3ce7760daf6?raw)

New Fossil patch releases are available on the [download page](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html). Upgrading
your Fossil client is recommended. The available releases are:

* 2.12.1 ← your best choice
* 2.11.2
* 2.10.2

These patch releases fix problems in Fossil whereby a collaborator whom
you trust can cause harm to your system. The attacks can only be carried out
by a site administrator or by someone with check-in privileges on the
repository, not by random passers-by on the internet. Nevertheless, these
are important vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. You should upgrade
at your earliest opportunity.

The patches work exactly the same as prior versions, except that
the [allow-symlinks](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help?cmd=allow-symlinks) property is no longer on by default on unix systems
and is no longer a versioned setting. This change is not strictly necessary
to fix the problem, though it seems a prudent security precaution.
The uncommon user who actually makes use of the legacy behavior
can recompile using the -DFOSSIL\_LEGACY\_ALLOW\_SYMLINKS compile-time option,
or can run the one-time command:

```
    fossil setting allow-symlinks on --global

```

Source code for the patch releases is provided. However, the dozens of
check-ins that went into preparing these patches, and tickets describing the
problems addressed, will be embargoed for a few days, to give everyone an
opportunity to update their clients.

### (2) By Sylvain Beucler ([beucnet](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=beucnet)) on 2020-08-20 16:27:54 in reply to [1](/forum/forumpost/a05ae3ce77) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/50a5b41e1600a195) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/50a5b41e1600a195?raw)

I am confused: does that mean there is no way to securely use symlinks in a Fossil repository?

By comparison, git appears to manage it ([doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-coresymlinks)).

(candid question, no trolling intended)

### (3.2) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2020-08-20 20:00:38 edited from [3.1](/forum/forumpost/0460750cc5?hist) in reply to [2](/forum/forumpost/50a5b41e16) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/87d012df9c51a0d9) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/87d012df9c51a0d9?raw)

We believe that activating "allow-symlinks" (and thus turning on the versioning
of symlinks) is secure. Nevertheless, the use of symlinks is risky, as the
code is complex. Who knows what undiscovered bugs might yet be lurking in the
convoluted code needed to manage symlinks safely. So, if you do not need
symlinks, it is safest to leave them turned off. Most people do not use
symlinks in their repositories. (Some people argue, persuasively I think,
that symlinks in a source repository are an abomination.) And so why should
we expose the majority of people who do not use symlinks to potential bugs
when it is so much safer and easier to just to turn them completely off.

The "allow-symlinks" option was made non-versioned in order to prevent a hostile
committer from turning them on without you knowing. If you want to enable
symlinks, that's fine. But you, the developer, should make that choice for
yourself. Some other collaborator from whom you pulled should not be able
to override that choice without your knowledge.

## Summary:

* Using symlinks in Fossil is secure, as far as we know.
* Nevertheless, they are now off by default, since they are seldom
  used and there is a risk of undetected bugs. In other words,
  symbolic links are disabled by default for defense in depth.
* Future versions of Fossil will include further safety measures
  to help ensure that symlinks are not abused. Hence future
  versions of Fossil make the use of symlinks even safer.

Yes.

It is *hilarious* that you (of all people) point that out, because i said to someone a couple days ago that if the site is running a version which is not in the timeline, Sean is going to notice the mysterious hash number and ask about it.

## How Long Should The Source Code Be Embargoed?

The dozens of individual check-ins that went into the security patch,
and the tickets that describe the security patch, have been embargoed
for a while to prevent miscreants from *easily* finding the vulnerabilities
until after everyone has had a chance to update. The question is, how
long should that embargo last.

In particular, I observe that people are building and using the Fossil from
trunk, which lacks the security patches. Which is better?

1. Release the source code now, so that people who build from trunk
   can have immediate access to the security patches
2. Delay releasing source code, giving people who use precompiled binaries
   more time to update before the vulnerabilities become easily
   discoverable?

### (8) By John Rouillard ([rouilj](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=rouilj)) on 2020-08-22 19:40:49 in reply to [7](/forum/forumpost/4dc62bc210) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/23017628a475c5a8) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/23017628a475c5a8?raw)

I would say wait a week from the announcement, so on the 27 unembargo.

I assume there is a CVE on this so people who get their info on security updates
via that mechanism will be alerted and perform their updates.

I am interested in how you are embargoing the changes and tickets. I didn't know
you could do that. Code wise, I assume a private branch could do that but how do you embargo tickets?

### (10) By Stephan Beal ([stephan](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=stephan)) on 2020-08-22 19:49:55 in reply to [8](/forum/forumpost/23017628a4) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/3757fa6d3a1d79b1) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/3757fa6d3a1d79b1?raw)

There is no CVE, but Openwall hosts a public announcement list for this sort of thing which all of the distro maintainers supposedly subscribe to, and it was announced there:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/20/1>

### (9) By [anonymous](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=anonymous) on 2020-08-22 19:41:33 in reply to [7](/forum/forumpost/4dc62bc210) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/b366d7402cf98c28) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/b366d7402cf98c28?raw)

I would argue it is easier for most scriptkiddies to diff two tarballs than to learn how to use Fossil. I mean, really, wget two tarballs, untar two tarballs, diff -Nru. It is that easy. I just did that and yeah, it is immediately obvious what was changed - it's not a long diff. Embargoing only creates a false sense of security, while people using trunk are unpatched. Given how trivial it is to diff, embargoing does more harm than good.

### (11) By John Rouillard ([rouilj](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=rouilj)) on 2020-08-22 20:26:04 in reply to [9](/forum/forumpost/b366d7402c) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/07fab2e27d9ef911) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/07fab2e27d9ef911?raw)

Well they don't need to know how to use fossil, just click on two items on the timeline.

However if you have published the tarball with the required changes, then
the cat's out of the bag. No need to embargo the changes as they have
already been published.

### (12) By sean ([jungleboogie](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=jungleboogie)) on 2020-08-22 23:58:52 in reply to [7](/forum/forumpost/4dc62bc210) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/7e0adf35038bb17a) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/7e0adf35038bb17a?raw)

Good question. I think I like John's approach of waiting a week, but that's really just arbitrary date.

FWIW, James committed a change for [OpenBSD](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports-cvs&m=159813565510691&w=2). Looks like [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/devel/fossil/) is running with 2.11.2.

I have no idea how to check other packages for the Linux OS's.

> I am interested in how you are embargoing the changes and tickets. I didn't know you could do that. Code wise, I assume a private branch could do that but how do you embargo tickets?

Yes, once the embargo is lifted at your discretion, could you explain what the heck you did?

As to the first half of the question...

An embargo is the easy part: keep in mind that each clone is a standalone copy of the original. If you change the project code on a clone you can even prohibit accidental syncing back to the original, while the `--project-code` flag to the [the pull command](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help/pull) allows the original to be pulled from if/when needed. So long as the copy doesn't commit directly to the same branch names being used by the parent, there will be no unintentional forks when/if the original is pulled back in.

There's also the closely-related concept of [child projects](https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/childprojects.wiki), in which case the `--from-parent` flag to `pull` would be useful.

You're probably saying, "of course! It's so obvious now!" However...

As for the other way around (the "unembargo"), that's something i'm eagerly waiting to see. It won't simply be a `pull --project-id ...` is about all i know.

*Hypothetically* it could be done by using [deconstruct](http://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help/deconstruct) on two repos, moving the "interesting" artifact from the clone to the original copy, and then using [reconstruct](http://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help/reconstruct) to reassemble it, but that would be exceedingly tedious for more than a small handful of artifacts. A script could build a list of artifacts the clone has which the parent doesn't, which could then be filtered out by type to allow re-import of, say, only wiki changes or only commits or only tickets, but it's still somewhat tedious. (The [bundle](http://fossil-scm.org/fossil/help/bundle) command could be used for commits, but not tickets, wiki pages, attachments, forum posts, ...)

We'll soon see what wizardry Richard invokes.

Wouldn't a private branch been simpler yet just as effective?

I dimly anticipate that playing games with the project code is the only way to keep some things private (e.g. wiki posts, for which there is no such thing as "private wiki") but assuming this embargoed change was all code, wasn't this a perfect use for this Fossil feature?

### (15) By Stephan Beal ([stephan](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=stephan)) on 2020-08-23 01:13:48 in reply to [14](/forum/forumpost/d749ff4807) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/c03c8f6f4606e03d) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/c03c8f6f4606e03d?raw)

> Wouldn't a private branch been simpler yet just as effective?

Possibly, with the usability caveat that everyone involved would have to explicitly use the `--private` flag when syncing and `--private` applies to *all* private branches. Autosync does not support that flag, so private branches would not be honored for autosync purposes when using `update` or `ci`. That could, of course, be overcome by disabling autosync and explicitly passing `--private` to all `pull` and `push` invocations, but that would get old really quickly and would break down if one participant had their own unrelated private branches which they didn't intend to publish.

> I dimly anticipate that playing games with the project code is the only way to keep some things private

So long as the repo is never pushed to the original and its URL is never published, it's "private" regardless of its project code. Changing the project code is only a "hardening" step, to prevent an accidental sync back to the original.

> but assuming this embargoed change was all code, wasn't this a perfect use for this Fossil feature?

If the assumption were correct, then possibly so, aside from the usability annoyances of the `--private` flag in a multi-user setup.

Barak Pearlmutter tells me that 2.12.1 is uploaded to Debian. I haven't heard
anything from any of the others. But based on the limited reports I've
received, it seems that package maintainers follow Openwall closely
and respond to vulnerability reports quickly. I'll probably release the
development sources on Monday night or Tuesday morning.

FreeBSD is not running with 2.11.2, it has 2.11,2
(the comma stands for port epoch, so this is still 2.11). I'm a regular FreeBSD user and I am wondering why the port hasn't been updated yet :/

### (21) By sean ([jungleboogie](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=jungleboogie)) on 2020-08-23 05:59:58 in reply to [20](/forum/forumpost/8ce9ae03de) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/39df01149d3a0073) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/39df01149d3a0073?raw)

That's right. I had forgotten about that. I'd suggest emailing the maintainer asking if they'd be willing to update the port. Additionally, request they use the tagged changes page. What I saw was pointing to an artifact (or something to that effect) of the changes.wiki page.

vs

If you're able, you can compile the released version and use that locally.

Yes I already did that, I manually updated the port Makefile to 2.12.1 . I think I will send the maintainer an email asking for official update of the port.

```

> The question is, how long should that embargo last.

I believe the  answer to that question depends largely  on the risk that
it presents to individuals and teams using Fossil.

If  the  majority  of  Fossil  usage is  found  in  small  groups  where
individuals inherently trust one another, then that risk seems minimal.

But if Fossil  is being adopted more widely into  environments where the
individuals are less likely to be trusted, then the risk is greater.

It's hard to  answer this question---seems that only  those using Fossil
in their own environments can know.

That's how *I* use Fossil. But I don't know whether or not my usage is
typical of others. I have no data on that.

That one (cross-repo localStorage sharing) was unrelated and turned out not to be a security issue at all, just an unsightly bug.

Subject: Fossil-SCM patch fixes RCE in all historic versions

Researcher Max Justicz discovered a potential RCE and other
vulnerabilities in the Fossil distributed version control system.
(<https://fossil-scm.org/>)  Patches to address these issues are now
available for download.  Package maintainers who bundle Fossil are
encouraged to update their packages without unnecessary delay.

All vulnerabilities require a pre-existing trust relationship between
the victim and the attacker.  In other words, the attacker must be
either a site administrator, or someone with check-in privileges on
the project.  There are no known vulnerabilities to servers from web
users entering tickets or forum messages or wiki or doing other
on-line operations.  The attacks require the ability to push, at
least, and the most serious RCE problem requires the ability to
configure a server in malicious ways.  If you are unable to upgrade to
one of the patched versions of Fossil, then you are encouraged at
least to know well the people from whom you clone or pull.

Precompiled binaries and source tarballs for the patched versions of
Fossil are available on the Fossil download page
(<http://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html>).  However, the dozens
of check-ins that went into generating these patches, and the tickets
that describe the specifics of the vulnerabilities, will be embargoed
for a few days.

See the thread on the Fossil Forum
(<https://fossil-scm.org/forum/info/a05ae3ce7760daf6>) for follow up
information or to communicate directly with the Fossil developers.

An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for fossil fixes the following issues:
- fossil 2.12.1:
\* CVE-2020-24614: Remote authenticated users with check-in or
administrative privileges could have executed arbitrary code
[boo#1175760]
\* Security fix in the "fossil git export" command. New "safety-net"
features were added to prevent similar problems in the future.
\* Enhancements to the graph display for cases when there are many
cherry-pick merges into a single check-in. Example
\* Enhance the fossil open command with the new --workdir option and the
ability to accept a URL as the repository name, causing the remote
repository to be cloned automatically. Do not allow "fossil open" to
open in a non-empty working directory unless the --keep option or the
new --force option is used.
\* Enhance the markdown formatter to more closely follow the CommonMark
specification with regard to text highlighting. Underscores in the
middle of identifiers (ex: fossil\_printf()) no longer need to be
escaped.
\* The markdown-to-html translator can prevent unsafe HTML (for example:
<script>) on user-contributed pages like forum and tickets and wiki.
The admin can adjust this behavior using the safe-html setting on the
Admin/Wiki page. The default is to disallow unsafe HTML everywhere.
\* Added the "collapse" and "expand" capability for long forum posts.
\* The "fossil remote" command now has options for specifying multiple
persistent remotes with symbolic names. Currently
only one remote can be used at a time, but that might change in the
future.
\* Add the "Remember me?" checkbox on the login page. Use a session
cookie for the login if it is not checked.
\* Added the experimental "fossil hook" command for managing "hook
scripts" that run before checkin or after a push.
\* Enhance the fossil revert command so that it is able to revert all
files beneath a directory.
\* Add the fossil bisect skip command.
\* Add the fossil backup command.
\* Enhance fossil bisect ui so that it shows all unchecked check-ins in
between the innermost "good" and "bad" check-ins.
\* Added the --reset flag to the "fossil add", "fossil rm", and "fossil
addremove" commands.
\* Added the "--min N" and "--logfile FILENAME" flags to the backoffice
command, as well as other enhancements to make the backoffice command
a viable replacement for automatic backoffice. Other incremental
backoffice improvements.
\* Added the /fileedit page, which allows editing of text files
online. Requires explicit activation by a setup user.
\* Translate built-in help text into HTML for display on web pages.
\* On the /timeline webpage, the combination of query parameters
"p=CHECKIN" and "bt=ANCESTOR" draws all ancestors of CHECKIN going
back to ANCESTOR.
\* Update the built-in SQLite so that the "fossil sql" command supports
new output modes ".mode box" and ".mode json".
\* Add the "obscure()" SQL function to the "fossil sql" command.
\* Added virtual tables "helptext" and "builtin" to the "fossil sql"
command, providing access to the dispatch table including all help
text, and the builtin data files, respectively.
\* Delta compression is now applied to forum edits.
\* The wiki editor has been modernized and is now Ajax-based.
- Package the fossil.1 manual page.
- fossil 2.11.1:
\* Make the "fossil git export" command more restrictive about characters
that it allows in the tag names
- Add fossil-2.11-reproducible.patch to override build date (boo#1047218)
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended installation methods

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
