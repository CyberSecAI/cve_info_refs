## FAQ

> [More FAQ’s](//www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/downloadsmanager/#faq/)
>
> [Detailed User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/8-download-manager-cmdm)

### How can I customize the look & feel of the plugin?

In your template you can create a directory called “CMDM”. Inside this you can place a structure that is similar to the one inside “cm-download-manager/views/frontend/”. If the file can be found in your template directory, then it will have a priority. Otherwise, the default file from the plugin directory will be used.

After installing the plugin it was very unresponsive on mobile, I had layout issues, pages overflowing outside the viewport width. Other than that it just has a very outdated look to it, which isn’t shown on the CM website. The plugin looks like a site from the mid 2000s.
I requested help multiple times from their support, to which they just respond with links to their documentation with no reference, and half the time the link they send doesn’t even answer your query.
After having a painful week back and forth with their support I asked for a refund as I had to seek another plugin that actually did as asked.
They refused a refund, unsurprisingly once I asked for my money back they were very quick to respond telling me why I couldn’t get my money back. They wanted me to reinstall the plugin so they could address the issues I had brought to their attention a week before, absolutely laughable.
AVOID AVOID AVOID!

Do not buy any plugins from Creative Minds. Their plugins do not do what they claim and require you to download and install no less than 3-4 add-on plugins to get the functionality it should have out of the box. Plus once you have the now 4-5 plugins installed you will find it is missing one or more basic features that it really should have. For this particular plugin just trying to customize the user front end was impossible and after several emails to support I was told they would do it for me at a rate of $60 per hours and a minimum of 12 hours. There are always better options for less out there so please do your research before purchasing anything from Creative Minds. Oh and there is no demo or trial period so again do not waste your money because they will fight you for a refund when you realize they lied and their plugin isn’t capable of doing what you expected without hours of additional customization by their ridiculously slow “experts”.
