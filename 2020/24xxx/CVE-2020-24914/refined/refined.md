Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24914:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `profile.php` file of the QCubed framework.
- It's caused by the unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data from the `strProfileData` POST variable. Specifically, the `unserialize(base64_decode($_POST['strProfileData']))` function is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the application unserializes untrusted data, leading to potential object injection.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the `strProfileData` before deserializing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
- The application does not check if the posted data is valid before passing it to unserialize.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `profile.php`.
- **`strProfileData` POST Variable:** The malicious serialized data is passed within the `strProfileData` variable, which is then base64 decoded and unserialized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Crafting Serialized Data:** The attacker needs the ability to create or obtain a payload consisting of a malicious PHP object serialized in base64.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- All versions of QCubed including 3.1.1 are affected.
- A patch was released by QCubed that allows disabling the profile functionality as a mitigation.
