The content is related to CVE-2020-24978.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A double-free vulnerability exists in the `pp_tokline` function in `asm/preproc.c` at line 6750.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a double-free, meaning a memory region is freed more than once. This leads to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to program crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted input file to the `nasm` assembler. Specifically, a malicious macro can cause a double free. The PoC provided in the bug report demonstrates how to trigger the double free by using the `-f win -o tmp.o $PoC` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the NASM assembler. The attacker does not need special privileges, but the program must be run with the malicious input.
