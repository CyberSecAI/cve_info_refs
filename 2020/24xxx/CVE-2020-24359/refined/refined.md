Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2020-24359:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `vault-ssh-helper` incorrectly accepted Vault-issued SSH OTPs for the subnet in which a host's network interface was located, instead of validating against the specific IP address assigned to that interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper IP address validation. The tool was validating against the subnet rather than the specific IP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass the intended access control by using a valid OTP from a different host within the same subnet.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to systems that rely on `vault-ssh-helper` for authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with a valid SSH OTP intended for a host within a subnet could reuse that OTP to access other hosts within the same subnet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid SSH OTP issued by Vault.
- The attacker must be within the same subnet as the target machine.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.2.0 of `vault-ssh-helper`.
- The changelog entry for version 0.2.0 specifically mentions CVE-2020-24359.
