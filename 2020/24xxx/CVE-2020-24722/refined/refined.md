Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the GAEN (Google/Apple Exposure Notification) protocol handles the Transmit Power (TX Power) value within the Associated Encrypted Metadata (AEM). Specifically:

1.  **Lack of Authentication:** The AEM, which includes the TX Power value, is encrypted but not authenticated. This allows attackers to manipulate the metadata by flipping bits in the encrypted data without detection.
2.  **Predictable TX Power Values:**  TX power values are device-dependent and can be known or estimated. Attackers can leverage this knowledge to manipulate the TX power value to their advantage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Risk-Score Inflation:**
    *   Attackers can manipulate the TX Power value in replayed beacons to make them appear closer than they are, artificially increasing the risk score of the victim's device.
    *   By bit-flipping the TX Power value, attackers can change it to a lower, valid value, creating the impression of closer proximity and thus increasing risk scores.
    *   Attackers can also flip specific bits in the TX power, leading to values that don't correspond to an existing device but are still interpreted as very close contact.
2.  **Deanonymization:**
    *   The TX power value is device-dependent, and some devices have unique TX power values, making it possible to deanonymize diagnosed users who own those devices.
    *   This is exacerbated when combined with statistical data about device usage in specific areas. Attackers can correlate observed TX power values with device models, especially for devices with uncommon values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Increased Risk Scores:** Attackers can manipulate the risk score calculated by the GAEN system, leading to unnecessary self-isolation or anxiety.
2.  **Privacy Violation:**  Attackers can deanonymize users infected with COVID-19, potentially exposing their identity and health status.
3. **Misleading Exposure Notifications:** By manipulating the metadata, attackers can induce false exposure notifications, disrupting the system's efficiency.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Replay Attacks:** Attackers record legitimate Bluetooth beacons and replay them with modified TX Power values.
2.  **Bit Flipping:** Exploiting the lack of authentication, attackers flip bits in the encrypted metadata to alter the TX power value.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Combining observed TX power values with statistical information about device usage to identify users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Proximity:** Attackers need to be within Bluetooth range to intercept and replay beacons.
2.  **Technical Knowledge:**  Attackers need to understand the GAEN protocol, the structure of the metadata, and how bit flipping works within the AES-CTR encryption.
3.  **Equipment:**  Attackers need tools to capture, modify, and rebroadcast Bluetooth signals.
4.  **Optional Knowledge of Devices:** Knowing or having a probabilistic understanding of device types can allow attackers to more accurately manipulate the TX power values.
5.  **Optional Access to Diagnosis Keys:** For the deanonymization attack, the attacker may need diagnosis keys of infected individuals or access to network traffic related to these keys.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Google and Apple. Google acknowledged the report but stated that they do not consider TX power authentication as a useful defense against relay attacks due to the existing tolerance for transmit power variations and the complexity of implementing such a defense.
*   The provided text includes C code that demonstrates calculating the most effective bit flips to lower TX power values and increase risk-scoring.
*   Google has published a reference verification service design and open source code to verify positive test results, mitigating some of the risks related to relay attacks.
*   Google has acknowledged that  location settings are not used by the Exposure Notification system for location purposes, but are required by Android's bluetooth API. Google also acknowledged that on Android 11 users will be able to use Exposure Notification Apps without turning on the device location setting.
