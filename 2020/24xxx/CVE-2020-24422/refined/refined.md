- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path in the Creative Cloud Desktop Application installer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but the vulnerability resides within the installer itself, so an attacker would likely need to inject malicious code into a location where the installer searches for executables or libraries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to influence the search path of the installer or replace files within the search path with malicious files. This could require local access or the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack during the installation process, depending on the specific implementation of the vulnerable installer.
