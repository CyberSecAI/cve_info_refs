Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24913:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the QCubed PHP framework. Specifically, the `profile.php` file is vulnerable via the `strQuery` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `strQuery` parameter, when passed within a serialized array to `profile.php`, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Unfiltered Query Execution:** The injected SQL code is directly passed to the `ExplainStatement` method of the database provider, which then executes the query without any filtering or sanitization.
- The `PrintExplainStatement` method concatenates "EXPLAIN " with the user-supplied `strQuery` parameter and executes it, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Potential Code Execution:** In worst-case scenarios, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the remote machine via the database.
- Data exfiltration and manipulation

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to `profile.php` with a malicious payload within the serialized array.
- The `strQuery` parameter within the serialized array is the entry point for SQL injection

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know that the `strQuery` parameter within the serialized array in profile.php can be used to inject SQL code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of QCubed, including version 3.1.1.
- Proof-of-concept exploits have been developed for both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. While a stacked-queries payload was not usable for MySQL, a time-based approach was viable.
- A patch to disable the profile functionality was released to address the vulnerability.
