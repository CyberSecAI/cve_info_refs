  "CVE-2020-24601": {
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the Openfire product. The XSS payload is executed whenever a user views a crafted POST request containing the malicious payload.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of user-supplied input within POST requests, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session. This can lead to:\n\t* Stealing cookies\n\t* Disclosure of end-user files\n\t* Redirection of the user to malicious websites",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted POST request containing the malicious XSS payload. The attack targets users by using the vulnerable application as the vehicle.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable Openfire instance.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was tested on Openfire version 4.5.0. The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning that the malicious script is injected into the response the user receives.  The specific vulnerable areas are not described in detail, but the provided PoC shows injected payloads are reflected in browser responses.",
    "remediation": "The suggested remediations include:\n\t* Context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input before echoing to the browser using an encoding library.\n\t* Input validation for special characters on all variables reflected to the browser.\n\t* Client-side validation."
