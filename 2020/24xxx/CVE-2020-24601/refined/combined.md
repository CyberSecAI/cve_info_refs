## CVE-2020-24601 – Multiple Cross-Site Scripting in Openfire Product

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### Openfire

#### Affected Product

##### Ignite Realtime Openfire

#### CVE

##### CVE-2020-24601

#### Securin ID

##### 2020-CSW-01-1039

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### February 5, 2020

### Description

A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code (javascript) to run in a userâs browser while the browser is connected to a trusted web site. The application targets your applicationâs users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. XSS payload is executed whenever the user views the crafted POST request with XSS Payload in Openfire 4.5.0 Product.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on Openfire version 4.5.0 Product.

Issue 01: Reflected cross-site scripting

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 01:* *Injected XSS payload ‘+accesskey=’X’+onclick=’alert(document.cookie), gets reflected in the browser response.***

Issue 02: Reflected cross-site scripting

![](data:image/png;base64...)***Figure 02:* *Injected XSS payload ‘+accesskey=’X’+onclick=’alert(document.cookie), gets reflected in the browser response.***

### Impact

* Stealing cookies
* End-user files disclosure.
* Redirection of the user to some other page or site.

### Remediations

Perform context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input before it is echoed back to a browser by using an encoding library. Implement input validation for special characters on all the variables that are reflecting to the browser and storing it in the database. Implement client-side validation
