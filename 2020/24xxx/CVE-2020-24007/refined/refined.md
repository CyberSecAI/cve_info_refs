Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-24007:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Umanni RH application does not implement any rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms on the login page, which allows for unlimited failed login attempts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of a limit on the number of login attempts.
*   **User Enumeration:** The content mentions that a user enumeration vulnerability exists in the password recovery feature. This allows an attacker to discover valid usernames prior to a brute force attack

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker can perform a brute-force attack to guess user passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Data Breach:** If successful, an attacker could access sensitive data managed within the application.
*   **Service Disruption:** While not explicitly stated, a large brute-force attack could potentially cause a denial-of-service by overloading the system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Login Page:** The attack is performed by making repeated login attempts to the login page of the Umanni RH application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to initiate the brute-force attack.
*   **User Enumeration:** The attacker requires the ability to enumerate valid usernames
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to reach the login page of the Umanni RH application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes screenshots of the login page and the outcomes of successful and unsuccessful login attempts, further demonstrating the described vulnerability and the process of a brute-force attack.
