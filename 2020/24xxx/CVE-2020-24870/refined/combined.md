# LibRaw: Stack buffer overread — GLSA **202208-07**

A buffer overread in LibRaw might allow an attacker to cause denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libraw** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.20.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.20.2** |

### Background

LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo cameras.

### Description

LibRaw incorrectly handles parsing DNG fields in some cases, potentially resulting in a buffer overread leading to denial of service.

### Impact

An attacker capable of providing crafted input to LibRaw could trigger denial of service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LibRaw users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libraw-0.20.2"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Steven Scott    2002-09-15 02:34:59 UTC  ``` HTTrack is the well-known (I think) website mirroring tool. Uses a slightly non-standard build/install that doesn't read $CFLAGS, won't compile with emake, and won't allow a simple "make install" to install it.  However I think I worked around the install issues generically enough by examining the makefiles and reimplementing the install using ebuild commands. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Steven Scott    2002-09-15 02:35:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3930](attachment.cgi?id=3930 "httrack-3.20.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3930&action=edit "httrack-3.20.ebuild")] httrack-3.20.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Maik Schreiber    2003-01-17 17:41:22 UTC  ``` Bouncing back to bug-wranglers due to time constraints. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Seth Chandler    2003-02-10 03:53:41 UTC  ``` already added it to portage (different bug) ``` |  |
