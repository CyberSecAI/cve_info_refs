Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-24394:

**1. Verification of Relevance**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-24394. The provided information from the Linux kernel commits mentions a fix for an issue where the NFS server fails to apply the umask on file systems without ACL support. This behavior is also mentioned in the Ubuntu security notice USN-4485-1.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the NFS server in the Linux kernel was not properly applying the umask when creating new file system objects on filesystems that lacked ACL (Access Control List) support. This happened because the server code was directly calling `vfs_create()`, `vfs_mknod()`, or `vfs_mkdir()`  without considering the current umask, as it was expected that ACL-aware file systems would handle it.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
- Improper handling of umask during file creation in the NFS server when the underlying filesystem does not support ACLs
- The server relies on the file system to take care of the umask, which is not correct for file systems without ACL support.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a potential for privilege escalation or data exposure where files can be created with more permissive permissions than desired, as the umask is not honored.
-  The vulnerability can lead to denial of service if an attacker is able to create malicious files on the filesystem.

**5. Attack Vectors**
- The vulnerability is triggered when an NFS client is creating files/directories through an NFSv4.2 server and if server is exporting a filesystem that does not support ACLs.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
- A local or remote attacker would require an account capable of creating files on an exported NFS filesystem.
- The attacker also needs to be mounting a filesystem from an NFS server using NFSv4.2 with server where ACL support is not present.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The issue is related to a server-side implementation, where the server bypasses applying the umask and passes the request straight to `vfs_create()`, `vfs_mknod()`, or `vfs_mkdir()`.
- The bug occurs because, for filesystems without ACL support, it is the responsibility of the caller of `vfs_create()`, `vfs_mknod()`, or `vfs_mkdir()` to apply the umask which was not happening. Filesystems that support ACLs are expected to handle the umask themselves.
- The server implementation correctly transmits the umask value to the vfs layer, where the problem lies. The vfs layer is not applying the umask if the underlying filesystem does not support ACLs.
- A fix involves adding a check for ACL support before applying the umask, making the server responsible for applying umask for non-ACL-aware file systems.
- There exists a similar, related issue which is fixed in the same patch set, where the same fix is also required for  `vfs_mknod` and `vfs_mkdir`.
