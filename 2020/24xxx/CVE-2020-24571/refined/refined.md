- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied paths, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access files outside the server's designated directory, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files or system files.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a path containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The provided example shows how to achieve this via `curl`.
