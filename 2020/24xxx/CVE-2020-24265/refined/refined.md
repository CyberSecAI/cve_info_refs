Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24265:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `MemcmpInterceptorCommon()` function within the `tcpreplay` suite, specifically triggered when using the `tcpprep` utility.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: A memory safety violation occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory block. This happens when the `MemcmpInterceptorCommon` function reads past the allocated buffer size, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The heap buffer overflow can cause the program to crash, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition. This could interrupt network traffic analysis and replay processes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious network capture file: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious network capture file that, when processed by `tcpprep`, triggers the heap buffer overflow in the `MemcmpInterceptorCommon()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted pcap or snoop capture file to a user who uses `tcpprep` to process it.
- No special privileges are needed, as the vulnerability occurs during normal usage of the `tcpprep` utility.
- The attacker could be remote.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Fedora and Fedora EPEL, with fixes being pushed to stable repositories.
- The bug was discovered in version 4.3.3 of tcpreplay.
- The `get_l2len()` function is also mentioned in the call stack trace, indicating that it may also have a role in triggering this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable function is located in the `/src/tcpreplay-4.3.3/src/common/get.c` file.
- The provided reproduction steps include the necessary commands to compile and trigger the vulnerability using a provided PoC file.
- Gentoo also mentions the vulnerability and provides an advisory for it.
