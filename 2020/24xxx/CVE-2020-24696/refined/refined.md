Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-24696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the GSS-TSIG support of PowerDNS Authoritative Server. Specifically, a race condition can be triggered by crafted DNS queries containing GSS-TSIG signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Race condition within the GSS-TSIG handling code.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution due to the race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crashes of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted DNS queries with a GSS-TSIG signature to the vulnerable PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- The attacker is unauthenticated and remote.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS queries.
- No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The GSS-TSIG feature had to be explicitly enabled at compile-time using `--enable-experimental-gss-tsig`. It was not enabled in official packages.
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the GSS-TSIG code completely in PowerDNS Authoritative version 4.4.0.
-  Versions prior to 4.4.0 are affected if compiled with the experimental GSS-TSIG flag.
-  The vulnerability is classified as low severity despite the possibility of arbitrary code execution
