Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24585:

**Verification:**

The content from the second GitHub page, specifically the release notes for wolfSSL version 4.5.0, mentions a fix for a DTLS vulnerability. It states: "During the handshake, clear application_data messages in epoch 0 are processed and returned to the application. Fixed by dropping received application_data messages in epoch 0.". This aligns with the description of CVE-2020-24585, which involves improper handling of DTLS application data in epoch 0.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the DTLS implementation in wolfSSL was incorrectly processing application data messages received during the initial handshake phase (epoch 0) before the security parameters were established.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper handling of DTLS handshake:** The application was accepting and processing application data packets too early in the handshake process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Leakage:** Clear application data sent in epoch 0 could potentially be intercepted and read by an attacker. This could expose sensitive information before the encryption is established.
-   **Potential for other attacks**: The improper handling of application data during handshake might potentially lead to other unspecified vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** An attacker positioned on the network can intercept traffic and send specially crafted DTLS packets to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) or privileged network position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and inject DTLS traffic between the client and server to send application data in epoch 0.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
