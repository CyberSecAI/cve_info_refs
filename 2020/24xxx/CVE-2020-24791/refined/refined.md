{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'fuel_replace_id' parameter before using it in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can compromise the application, access, or modify data, and exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the 'fuel_replace_id' parameter in the '/fuel/pages/replace/1' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint. They must also be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, which is typically done using a tool like Burp Suite."
