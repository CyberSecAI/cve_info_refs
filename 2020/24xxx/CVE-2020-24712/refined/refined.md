Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "IMAP Host" input field within the Gophish application. Specifically, when a user enters a malicious JavaScript payload into this field and subsequently clicks the "Test Settings" button, the application executes the script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Non-persistent Self-Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS):** The application is vulnerable to a self-XSS attack where the malicious script is executed within the user's browser session but is not stored. This vulnerability occurs because the application does not sanitize or encode user-provided input before displaying it in the context of a JavaScript execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Limited Scope:** This is a self-XSS vulnerability, meaning the impact is primarily on the user who enters the malicious input. The attacker cannot directly impact other users unless they can trick them into injecting the payload into their own session.
- **Potential for User Compromise:** While not a severe vulnerability due to its "self" nature, an attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the user's session if they trick the user into entering a payload. This can lead to cookie theft or other malicious actions within the user's browser.
- **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, the clickjacking vulnerability fixed in the same release (mentioned in the release notes) highlights potential for attackers to trick authenticated users into actions, such as resetting their API key, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Input:** The attack vector is through the "IMAP Host" input field in the settings page of the Gophish application.
- **Triggering the Payload:** The vulnerability is triggered by pressing the "Test Settings" button after entering the malicious script in the "IMAP Host" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User Access:** The attacker needs to have valid access to the Gophish application settings page. This generally means the attacker must be a legitimate administrator or user with the necessary access.
- **User Manipulation:** Since this is a self-XSS, the attacker would have to trick a user into entering the malicious payload into their own browser session.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by adding input sanitization to the application.
- **Mitigation:** The advisory recommends treating all user input as potentially dangerous and encoding all output based on user-controlled data. They also recommend server-side validation, preferably using whitelist filters.
- **Timeline:** The advisory shows a clear timeline of discovery, contact with the vendor, fix implementation, and release of the security advisory.
- **Vendor Response:** The vendor (Gophish) responded promptly to the report and addressed the vulnerability with a commit.
- **Release Notes:** Gophish v0.11.0 release notes mentions that this XSS was one of the multiple vulnerabilities fixed, which required authenticated access and only affected the user that created the objects or an administrator using "Impersonate" feature.
- **Fix Details:** The commit [4e9b94b](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/commit/4e9b94b641755f359542b246cc0c555fa3bc6715) specifically shows the changes made to sanitize the IMAP hostname in `settings.js`, using `escapeHtml()` function before rendering the user-supplied value.
