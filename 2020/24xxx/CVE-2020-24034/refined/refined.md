    {
      "cve": "CVE-2020-24034",
      "root_cause": "Insecure deserialization of the session cookie.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The router uses a serialized session cookie that can be manipulated by an attacker.",
        "The 'user' value within the session cookie is not properly validated.",
        "The 'internal' user account has permissions that exceed those of a legitimate administrator, including the ability to flash custom firmware."
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated user can escalate privileges to any other user, including the 'internal' user. This allows the attacker to flash custom firmware and gain complete control of the router.",
       "attack_vector": "By modifying the 'user' value within the session cookie.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a valid session (sess_id, nonce, ha1 values). They need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests or use a tool to do so."
