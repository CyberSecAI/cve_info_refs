Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `fullname` parameter in the `user-profile.php` file. The value of this parameter is directly inserted into an HTML tag attribute without any encoding or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application echoes user-supplied input from the `fullname` parameter directly into the HTML output, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application's response, potentially leading to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session information.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web page.
    - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the `fullname` POST parameter of the `user-profile.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to `user-profile.php` with a malicious payload in the `fullname` parameter. No authentication is required for exploitation.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into making the crafted request to the vulnerable page, or have the user access a malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `user-profile.php` where the `fullname` parameter is retrieved: `$fullname = $_POST['fullname'];` and in `includes/sidebar.php` where it's displayed `<div class="profile-usertitle-name"><?php echo $name; ?></div>`.
- A proof-of-concept payload used to trigger the XSS is: `rwsg6"><script>alert(1)</script>x88n2` which is injected into the fullname parameter within a POST request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a low risk due to the medium attack complexity.
- The CVSS base score is 4.3, with an exploitability subscore of 8.6 and an impact subscore of 2.9.
- The vulnerable software is Daily Tracker System v1.0 from SourceCodester.
- The CWE is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
