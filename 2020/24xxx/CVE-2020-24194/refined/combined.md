# Exploit Title: Daily Tracker System - Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
# Exploit Author: Adeeb Shah (@hyd3sec) & Bobby Cooke (boku)
# CVE ID: CVE-2020-24194
# Date: September 2, 2020
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.sourcecodester.com/
# Software Link: https://www.sourcecodester.com/download-code?nid=14372&title=Daily+Tracker+System+in+PHP%2FMySQL
# Version: v1.0
# Tested On: Windows 10 Pro (x64) + XAMPP
# Vulnerability Details:
# The value of the fullname request parameter is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in double quotation marks. The payload rwsg6"><script>alert(1)</script>x88n2 was submitted in the fullname parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the application's response. This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response.
# Vulnerable Source Code
# ./user-profile.php
# 11 $fullname=$\_POST['fullname'];
# ./includes/sidebar.php
# 21 <div class="profile-usertitle-name"><?php echo $name; ?></div>
