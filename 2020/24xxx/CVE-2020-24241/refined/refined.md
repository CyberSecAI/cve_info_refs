The provided content is related to CVE-2020-24241.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free error in the `saa_wbytes` function within `nasmlib/saa.c` at line 132. This occurs due to incorrect memory management when handling specific input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free: A memory region is freed and then accessed afterwards, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The primary impact is a crash of the NASM assembler due to memory corruption.
- Potential for other issues: While not explicitly stated, heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited for more serious impacts such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted assembly source code: The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specific assembly input to NASM which exploits a flaw in the memory management within the `saa_wbytes` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input to the NASM assembler: An attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted assembly file as input to NASM, either directly or indirectly through a process that uses NASM.
