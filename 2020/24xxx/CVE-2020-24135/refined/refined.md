Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `cssjs.php` file directly embedding user-supplied input from the `type` GET parameter into the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the unsanitized user input directly into the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `type` parameter. When a victim loads the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
*   This can lead to a full compromise of the user, allowing attackers to perform actions such as:
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Modifying the content of the webpage
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious script in the `type` GET parameter. For example `wcms/wcms/wex/cssjs.php?type=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
*   Attackers can distribute the crafted URL through various means, such as:
    *   Phishing emails
    *   Malicious links on websites
    *   Social engineering

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim into visiting it.
*   No special access or position within the application is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided description references a code snippet `type='<?php echo $_GET['type'];?>'`, highlighting the exact location of the vulnerability.
* It also offers a proof-of-concept example by sending `<script>alert()</script>` in the `type` parameter, clearly demonstrating how the XSS vulnerability can be triggered.
* It also references a Portswigger link on how to prevent XSS.
