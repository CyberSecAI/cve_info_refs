Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24924

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Policy[name]" and "Policy[description]" parameters when editing policies within the ElkarBackup application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the mentioned fields, which is then stored in the database. This code will be executed when other users view or interact with the affected policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Modifying page content
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
- By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the ElkarBackup application and the data it manages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of ElkarBackup, specifically within the policy editing section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to edit policies within ElkarBackup.
- **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
-  The attacker injects malicious payloads such as `<svg/onload=alert(4)>` or `<svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>` into the `Policy[name]` and `Policy[description]` fields when editing a policy.
- The injected JavaScript executes when a user views the policy.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable version is ElkarBackup 1.3.3.
- The provided exploit steps include logging in with default credentials, navigating to the policy edit page, injecting the payload, and saving the changes. The injected code then executes when viewing the policy.
