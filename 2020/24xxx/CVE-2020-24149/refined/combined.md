## Description

Sync Podcast RSS feeds with your WordPress website automatically. The Podcast Importer plugin helps to easily import podcasts into WordPress. You can import your podcast into the regular WordPress posts or into a custom post type (if you have an existing one).

The plugin fully supports popular WordPress podcasting plugins such as PowerPress, Seriously Simple Podcasting, Simple Podcast Press, and works even better with podcast themes developed by [SecondLineThemes](https://secondlinethemes.com)

The plugin supports importing episodes into existing custom post types, assign categories, import featured images and more. Additionally, the plugin enables continuous import or “Sync” of podcast RSS feeds, so every time you release a new podcast episode, it could be automatically created within WordPress. You can also set multiple import schedules and import different podcasts from separate sources at the same time. (For example, when importing separate podcasts from separate feeds into one website)

To use the plugin, simply run a new import under “Tools -> Podcast Importer SecondLine” via the main menu that appears in your WordPress dashboard. Set the different options and if you need a continuous import process for future episodes, make sure to hit that checkbox before running the import process.

You can disable a schedueld import at any time by simply deleting the import entry.

The plugin also supports automatic import of native / embed audio players from 15+ podcast hosting providers, including: Buzzsprout, Megaphone, Pinecast, Captivate, Transistor, [Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm), Simplecast, Podbean, Whooshkaa, Omny, Ausha, Spreaker, [Podcastpage.io](https://podcastpage.io) Audioboom, Fireside, Libsyn and more.

### Pro Version

The Pro version can be found here – <https://secondlinethemes.com/podcast-importer-pro>

It includes:

\* Unlimited scheduled imports for podcasts/shows.

\* Import to any Custom Post Type or Custom Taxonomy.

\* Set specific import intervals / times.

\* Import transcripts from RSS feed.

\* Import audio player to custom fields.

\* Import tags and categories from the feeds.

\* Force a re-sync on all existing episodes (to update metadata)

\* Set a global featured image to all imported episodes.

\* Manual “Sync” button to sync on demand.

  Add multiple continuous import processes of separate podcasts.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/podcast-importer-secondline` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress.
3. Run a new import via the “Tools -> Podcast Importer Secondline” section in your WordPress admin panel.
4. If needed, delete any of the scheduled import processes.

## FAQ

### The import failed or takes too much time to process?

You can run the improter multiple times, as it will never import the same post twice. Once all episodes are imported, only future ones would be imported, assuming you selected the continuous import option.

If you import a large feed while importing featured images, it may take several runs to fully complete, so make sure to run the import process several times until all episodes were imported.

### Do you support podcast feeds from any host?

Sure. All types of podcast feeds can be imported, as long as they are in an RSS/XML format. If you feel something is missing, please reach out and we will ensure to look into it.

### The import does not work for my podcast feed

First of all, make sure you are filling in a valid URL, of a valid podcast RSS feed. Second, make sure your server is up to modern requirements – we recommend PHP 7 or above.

Having a bit of a challenge to add existing Podcasts from Podbean to a new website I was pretty much at a loss on the best way to do it.This plugin is awesome, imported everything perfectly and with a bit of setup I have it working with a custom Avada blog layout as well.Thanks SecondLine for solving my problem. The site is still in development but I think we’ll buy the pro version before we go live.

If you want to import your podcasts automatically this is the perfect plugin.
The customer support is amazing as well, even for the free version.
Support good plugins or they go away, people!

An excellent plugin for importing podcasts into your WordPress website.
The only downside is that there is no option to limit the number or age of the post on the initial download. Can be a bit out of date when you’re downloading podcasts from 2011 and earlier.

Downgraded rating from 5 stars to 3 stars due to latest update placing in nudge spam on every admin page to use their theme.

I love that it continuously imports podcasts from any RSS feed so I can keep several podcasts on their current hosts but display them in one place. Thank you, looking forward to future features!
