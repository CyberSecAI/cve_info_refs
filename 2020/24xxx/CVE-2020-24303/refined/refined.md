  "vulnerability": {
    "id": "CVE-2020-24303",
    "summary": "Grafana versions prior to 7.1.0-beta are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.",
    "details": "The problem is caused by the bs-typeahead directive which evals the select options passed to it. We are using an old version of ng-strap which allows only an array of strings to be passed as available options. The alias in Elastic and TestData query editor allows providing special characters, so, for instance, specifying alias as `<img src onerror=\"alert(document.cookie)\">` creates a possible XSS attack vector.",
    "affected_products": [
      "NetApp products incorporating Grafana versions prior to 7.1.0-beta"
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by specifying a malicious series alias in the Elastic and TestData query editor, which will be rendered by the bs-typeahead directive.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to access and modify the alias fields in the corresponding query editors (Elasticsearch or TestData query editor)."
