Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2020-11-13: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)

Discovery Status:
=================
Published

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local

Severity Level:
===============
Medium

Authentication Type:
====================
Restricted Authentication (User Privileges)

User Interaction:
=================
No User Interaction

Disclosure Type:
================
Bug Bounty

Technical Details & Description:
================================
Insecure inherited permissions in firmware update tool for some Intel(R)
NUCs may allow an authenticated user with
system privileges to potentially enable an escalation of the local
process privilege via local system access.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Intel recommends that users update to the latest NUC firmware version
(see provided table). Intel recommends
users update HDMI Firmware Update Tool for NUC7i3DN, NUC7i5DN and
NUC7i7DN to an updated version 1.76 via the
following URL: <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27315?v=t>

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local privilege escalation vulnerability in the
intel nuc is estimated as medium.
