Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `scanServer64` module of Trend Micro Apex One. This missing validation leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The vulnerability specifically allows reading data beyond the boundaries of an allocated memory buffer.
- Lack of input validation: The core issue is the absence of adequate checks on user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: The primary impact is the ability for an attacker to disclose sensitive information present in the system's memory.
- Privilege escalation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used along with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and achieve SYSTEM level code execution, although this specific vulnerability does not directly allow for code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs local access to the target machine and the ability to execute low-privileged code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system before exploiting this vulnerability.
