  "CVE-2020-24659": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the PSK binder calculation within the `client_send_params` function in `lib/ext/pre_shared_key.c`. A realloc on `extdata->data` invalidates `client_hello.data`, which is later accessed in `compute_psk_binder` function.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Use-after-free",
         "Memory Corruption"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a denial of service (DoS). In TLS 1.3 clients, a null-pointer dereference can cause a crash via an invalid read.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted TLS handshake where the server sends a \"no_renegotiation\" alert at an unexpected time, followed by an invalid second handshake.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the server and initiate a TLS handshake with a vulnerable client, by acting as a man-in-the-middle. "
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A server can trigger the client to run into heap buffer overflow if a `no_renegotiation` alert is sent at an unexpected timing. This may cause the client to crash at the session deinitialization phase.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS).",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted TLS handshake with a server sending a `no_renegotiation` alert in an unexpected timing.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to control a TLS server and make a connection to a vulnerable client to exploit this vulnerability."
