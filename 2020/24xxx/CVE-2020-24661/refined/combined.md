This allows a meddler in the middle to present a different invalid certificate to intercept incoming and outgoing mail.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1872968#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-08-27 04:05:01 UTC  ``` Created geary tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1872970](show_bug.cgi?id=1872970 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-24661 geary: mishandles pinned TLS certificate verification for IMAP and SMTP services using invalid TLS certificates [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1872968#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-08-27 07:17:31 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

Fedora Update Notification

2020-09-03 16:38:32.949710
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : geary
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 3.36.3.1
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary>
Summary : A lightweight email program designed around conversations
Description :
Geary is a new email reader for GNOME designed to let you read your
email quickly and effortlessly. Its interface is based on
conversations, so you can easily read an entire discussion without
having to click from message to message. Geary is still in early
development and has limited features today, but we're planning to add
drag-and-drop attachments, lightning-fast searching, multiple account
support and much more. Eventually we'd like Geary to have an
extensible plugin architecture so that developers will be able to add
all kinds of nifty features in a modular way.

# (CVE-2020-24661) Invalid certificates not checked against locally pinned certificates when GCR support not available

If there is no read-write PKCS#11 store accessible by GCR (e.g, gnome-keyring-daemon is not installed, the gnome-keyring user PKCS#11 store is not installed or enabled, or gnome-keyring has dropped support for it, again), and an exception for an invalid TLS certificate has previously been allowed by the user for a specific server identity (e.g. the host name/IP address configured for the service), then subsequent connections to the same server identity will be accepted without comparing the certificate presented by the server with the certificate that was originally presented and pinned.

This allows e.g. MITM attacks against connections with the same configured identity when using invalid certificates.

This can be mitigated by any of: a) ensuring your system is [correctly configured](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary/FAQ#Not_running_GNOME_3.3F) WRT PKCS#11 stores, b) not using invalid certificates (including self-signed certificates), c) not creating exceptions for invalid certificates.

Original description:

**Bug Summary**

Geary accepts self-signed X.509 certificates when doing STARTTLS (and probably also implicit TLS). This allows a Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) to steal emails and user credentials.

**Your installation**

* Geary version: geary-3.34.2 (NixOS)
* Installation method: nix-env -i
* Desktop environment: KDE
* Operating system and version: <https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-20.03/latest-nixos-x86_64-linux.ova>
* Email provider: not important

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Setup a local mailserver with an "invalid" X.509 certificate, i.e. self-signed, one where the root-CA is not trusted by the operating system, etc.
   (I used mkcert, <https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert>)
2. Try to connect Geary to that mail server and observe that no warning is displayed.

**What did you expect to happen?**

Geary should under no circumstances just proceed with the connection. It must issue a warning and obtain user permission to do so. IMHO Thunderbird is a good example how to do it properly.

**Relevant logs and/or screenshots**

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-95f2c5cc25
2020-09-08 15:13:30.490624
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : geary
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 3.34.2
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary>
Summary : A lightweight email program designed around conversations
Description :
Geary is a new email reader for GNOME designed to let you read your
email quickly and effortlessly. Its interface is based on
conversations, so you can easily read an entire discussion without
having to click from message to message. Geary is still in early
development and has limited features today, but we're planning to add
drag-and-drop attachments, lightning-fast searching, multiple account
support and much more. Eventually we'd like Geary to have an
extensible plugin architecture so that developers will be able to add
all kinds of nifty features in a modular way.
