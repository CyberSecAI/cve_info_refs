Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-24661:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Geary handles pinned TLS certificates when a system is not configured to use a system-provided PKCS#11 store, such as gnome-keyring. Specifically, if a user has previously created an exception for an invalid certificate (e.g., a self-signed certificate) for a specific server, subsequent connections to that same server identity are accepted without validating the certificate against the originally presented and "pinned" certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Insecure Certificate Pinning:** Geary does not properly enforce certificate pinning when a system PKCS#11 store is unavailable. It trusts a previously accepted certificate for a server without re-validating its authenticity.
-   **Mishandling of Invalid Certificates:** Geary does not properly handle invalid or self-signed certificates when not using the PKCS#11 store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the user and the mail server can intercept incoming and outgoing mail by presenting a different, invalid certificate.
-   **Credential Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal email credentials if the user enters them over the compromised connection.
-   **Data Exposure:**  Sensitive email content could be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Geary client and the mail server.
-   **MitM position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Interception:**  The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting network traffic between the client and the mail server.
-   **Certificate Forgery/Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to present an invalid certificate that will be accepted by the vulnerable Geary client due to the bypassed pinning.
-   **Targeted Server:** The attacker needs to target a server for which the user has previously created a certificate exception.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when Geary does not have access to a read-write PKCS#11 store. This can happen if gnome-keyring-daemon is not installed or the user PKCS#11 store is not enabled, among other scenarios.
- The vulnerability exists for both IMAP and SMTP services.
- The issue is mitigated in Geary versions 3.36.3.1 and 3.37.91 and later.
- Workarounds include properly configuring system PKCS#11 stores, avoiding invalid certificates, and not creating exceptions for invalid certificates.
