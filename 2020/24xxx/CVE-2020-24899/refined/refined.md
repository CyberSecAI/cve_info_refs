The provided content discusses a post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Nagios 5.7.2. This vulnerability is not related to the specified CVE-2020-24899 which is a placeholder.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-provided input within one of the configuration wizards. Specifically, the application executes user-supplied data as shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application directly executes user-controlled input within a shell context.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: There's no proper sanitization or validation of the input before it is passed to the shell.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the Nagios application. This includes the possibility of gaining a reverse shell and taking full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the Nagios web interface
- The attacker needs to navigate to a specific Configuration Wizard
- The attacker injects malicious shell code via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires valid login credentials for the Nagios application.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Nagios server.
