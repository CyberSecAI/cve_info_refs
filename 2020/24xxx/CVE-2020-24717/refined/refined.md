Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commits, which relates to CVE-2020-24717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in incorrect permission checking within the ZFS file system implementation on FreeBSD. Specifically, the issue is related to how ZFS handles and maps user and group IDs, particularly when dealing with non-POSIX IDs (like SIDs from Active Directory). The initial implementation had flaws in how it verified permissions, potentially leading to incorrect access control decisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect permission checks:** The `zfs_fastaccesschk_execute` function in `zfs_acl.c` was performing insufficient checks when dealing with non-POSIX IDs, specifically with regards to file execute permissions. This could allow users to bypass intended file permissions.
- **Incorrect FUID mapping:** The mapping of FUIDs (File User IDs) to system UIDs and GIDs was flawed, particularly in the FreeBSD implementation. This could lead to the system not properly recognizing user/group ownership of files and directories.
- **Lack of KSID handling**:  The initial code did not correctly consider KSIDs which are used to represent Windows security identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The primary impact is unauthorized access or execution of files. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to data or execute files they would normally not have permission to, which could escalate privileges or result in data compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have some form of access to the system and be able to interact with the ZFS file system. This could be a user with limited privileges who leverages the incorrect permission checks to gain more access.
Specifically, if the user has a non-POSIX ID, the flawed `zfs_fastaccesschk_execute` logic would not verify correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a user on a FreeBSD system with a ZFS file system.
- They would need to have access to files with execute permissions, which are controlled via flawed permission checks.
- The attacker's user or group membership needs to be represented by a non-POSIX ID.

**Technical Details:**

The provided commits include several code changes to correct the issue, including:

- **`include/os/freebsd/spl/sys/idmap.h`:** Defines constants related to ID mapping and error codes, including handling of non-POSIX IDs like SIDs.
- **`include/os/freebsd/spl/sys/kidmap.h`:**  Defines an interface for kernel ID mapping.
- **`include/os/freebsd/spl/sys/sid.h`:** Defines the structure for KSIDs.
-   **`module/Makefile.bsd`**: Adds `-DHAVE_KSID` flag for compilation
-   **`module/os/freebsd/zfs/zfs_acl.c`:**  Removes the fast path for execute permission checking when non-POSIX ID's are being used, thus making sure the slow path with correct permission checking is always used.
-   **`module/os/freebsd/zfs/zfs_fuid_os.c`:** Removed in the commit and the functionality moved to `zfs_fuid.c`.
-   **`module/zfs/zfs_fuid.c`:** The function `zfs_fuid_map_id()` was modified to correctly map FUIDs, especially when dealing with SIDs using `ksid_to_uid()`.
- `zfs_groupmember`: Correctly uses ksidlist to check group membership.
- The creation of FUIDs now correctly takes into account the kdomain.
- The logic for looking up mapped IDs was corrected.

The commit messages explicitly state "FreeBSD: Fix UNIX permissions checking" and reference a pull request that highlights the issue's resolution.

**In summary:** The commits address vulnerabilities stemming from incorrect permission checks and faulty ID mappings in the ZFS file system on FreeBSD when non-POSIX IDs (like SIDs) are present. The fixes ensure correct mapping of user and group identifiers and proper enforcement of access control lists.
