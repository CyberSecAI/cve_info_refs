Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-24455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing initialization of a variable within the Trusted Platform Module (TPM2) software stack (tpm2-tss) when handling FAPI (Feature API) PolicyPCR. Specifically, when reading PCR values via the 'ifapi_read_pcr' routine, a PCR list counter was not being set. This caused an incorrect policy instantiation, omitting PCR checks when using `currentPcrs` and `currentPcrsAndBank` options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect policy instantiation for `PolicyPCR` objects when using `currentPcrs` and `currentPcrsAndBank` options in FAPI. The generated policy omits PCR checks which are intended to verify that the platform is in a specific state before allowing operations.
- This leads to a bypass of intended PCR based access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Data encrypted using TPM2-TSS might not be protected from a local attacker. An attacker could bypass intended PCR checks, which are used to ensure a specific system state is present before allowing operations such as decryption.
- Privilege Escalation: A privileged local user could potentially exploit the vulnerability to achieve an escalation of privilege.
- Potential DoS: An incorrect policy instantiation can lead to a denial-of-service scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access.
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user to create/modify policies using the vulnerable API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be a privileged user who can create or modify FAPI policies.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed in `tpm2-tss` versions 2.4.3 and 3.0.1.
- The vulnerability affects all TPM objects created using `PolicyPCR` with the `currentPcrs` and `currentPcrsAndBank` options. These objects need to be recreated after the fix.
- Non-FAPI policies created using `tpm2_createpolicy` with explicit PCR values are not affected.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a policy to lock against the "current" value of the PCR, and then changing the PCR value, which should prevent the policy from working. However, due to the bug, the policy still succeeds.
