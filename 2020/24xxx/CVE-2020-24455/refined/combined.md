### Changed or Fixed

* Fix [CVE-2020-24455](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qh4p-3mhw-2cp7 "CVE-2020-24455") FAPI PolicyPCR not instatiating correctly

  Note that all TPM object created with a PolicyPCR with the currentPcrs

  and currentPcrsAndBank options have been created with an incorrect policy

  that ommits PCR checks. All these objects have to be recreated!
* Fix bug in FAPI NV creation with custom index values
* Cleanup of leftover sessions in error cases in FAPI
* Better error messages in several FAPI errors
* Add checks to FAPI policy paths
* Add checks if FAPI is correctly provisioned
* Fix execution of FAPI policies in some cases
* Allow 0x prefixes for TPMU\_HA in JSON encoding

If a FAPI policy is created to lock against the "current" value of the PCR, it doesn't actually do so. So the above policy does not actually work as it should. See below:  # assume the TPM is provisioned already (it can be provisioned though the tss2_provision command)  tpm2_pcrreset 16 tss2_import -i pol_pcr16_read.json -p pol_pcr16_read tss2_createkey -p HS/SRK/myCryptKey -t decrypt,noda -a "" -P pol_pcr16_read echo "verysecret" | tss2_encrypt -p HS/SRK/myCryptKey -i -  -o secret.out tpm2_pcrextend 16:sha256=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 # this should fail tss2_decrypt -p HS/SRK/myCryptKey -i secret.out -o secret.txt  However, due the above CVE, this is not the case, and it succeeds. FAPI policies create with explicit PCR values and non-FAPI policies created tpm2_createpolicy are not affected. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2020-10-11 09:30:14 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=dafe3d1624affb9c284e9820a4dafaee48c92694>  commit dafe3d1624affb9c284e9820a4dafaee48c92694 Author:     Salah Coronya <salah.coronya@gmail.com> AuthorDate: 2020-09-23 21:02:54 +0000 Commit:     Joonas Niilola <juippis@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2020-10-11 09:29:56 +0000      app-crypt/tpm2-tss: Bump to 3.0.1, fix CVE-2020-24455          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/746563>     Package-Manager: Portage-3.0.4, Repoman-3.0.1     Signed-off-by: Salah Coronya <salah.coronya@gmail.com>     Signed-off-by: Joonas Niilola <juippis@gentoo.org>   app-crypt/tpm2-tss/Manifest              |  1 +  app-crypt/tpm2-tss/tpm2-tss-3.0.1.ebuild | 75 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 76 insertions(+) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-10-11 14:20:20 UTC  ``` Maintainer, please call for stabilization when ready. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Christopher Byrne    2020-10-12 00:19:01 UTC  ``` Ok to stabilize just 2.4.3.

disclosure to a local attacker.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/tpm2-tss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.3** |

### Background

TCG TPM2 Software Stack is a library to interface with trusted platform
modules.

### Description

protect data encrypted with the trusted platform module.

### Impact

protected from an attacker.

### Workaround

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/tpm2-tss-2.4.3"

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
