Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Freebox Server's UPnP MediaServer service (fbxupnpd/0.1.0), running on TCP port 52424, is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks. This is due to the service accepting any value of the `Host` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DNS Rebinding:** The UPnP MediaServer service does not properly validate the `Host` header, allowing an attacker to bypass the same-origin policy by manipulating DNS resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Exfiltration:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access and exfiltrate files from the storage attached to the Freebox.
*   The attacker can list the files through DNS rebinding by sending crafted SOAP requests
*   The attacker can read the files using URIs of the form `http://<rebinding-domain>:52424/files/<volume>/<file>`

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Rebinding:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that uses a DNS rebinding technique (e.g., using a service like `rebind.network`).
*   The victim visits the attacker's malicious web page, which initiates the DNS rebinding.
*   The malicious Javascript on the web page makes requests to the vulnerable service on the local network after the DNS rebinding is successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website accessible to the victim.
*   **Victim in the Same Network:** The victim must be on the same local network (LAN) as the vulnerable Freebox device.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting their malicious website. This could be achieved by embedding the malicious javascript in an iframe on a seemingly harmless website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The article mentions that while the attacker can exfiltrate files using this vulnerability, the Freebox does not seem to support writing to the storage or uploading files using this interface, which limits the severity of the impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Freebox Server version 4.2.3
*   The fix involved validating the host header against a list of suitable values.
