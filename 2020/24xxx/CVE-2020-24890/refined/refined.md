Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-24890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs within the `parse_tiff_ifd` function in the `src/metadata/tiff.cpp` file of the LibRaw library. This happens when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is not pointing to a valid location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault (crash) of the application using LibRaw.
- In some cases, the vulnerability may be exploited by a remote attacker by enticing a user to open a specially crafted image file using an application linked against LibRaw, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process. This is also mentioned in the Gentoo Security Advisory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted image file, specifically a TIFF file, that leads to the null pointer dereference in the `parse_tiff_ifd` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious image file which can trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted image file using an application that uses a vulnerable version of LibRaw.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bugzilla entries ([1882345](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1882345), [1882349](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1882349)) are tracking bugs for the same vulnerability in Fedora.
- The vulnerability was fixed in LibRaw version 0.20.0, so upgrading to this version or higher should fix it.
- The Github issue #335 provides a stack trace and a reproducer for the issue.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202010-05) confirms the vulnerability and recommends upgrading to a patched version.
- The Fedora update notification indicates that a patch for CVE-2020-24890 has been applied to the LibRaw package.
