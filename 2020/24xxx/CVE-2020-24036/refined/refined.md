Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-24036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in the `GenerateUrl` AJAX action within the ForkCMS backend. Specifically, the `parameters` value from a request is directly passed to `unserialize()` without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a PHP object injection. By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object and providing it as the `parameters`, an attacker can force the application to instantiate arbitrary objects with attacker-controlled data.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate or sanitize the input before passing it to `unserialize()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the potential for remote code execution on the server. By injecting malicious objects, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute arbitrary PHP code, enabling them to compromise the entire system.
*   **File Deletion:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates file and directory deletion on the webserver.
*   **Webshell Execution:** The attacker could gain a webshell.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
*   **Backend Ajax Endpoint:**  The attack occurs through the `GenerateUrl` AJAX action within the backend of ForkCMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of ForkCMS, however the required permissions are minimal ("Dashboard" permissions are sufficient).
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the ForkCMS installation.
*   **Understanding of PHP object injection and gadget chains:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious payload using available gadgets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of ForkCMS below 5.8.3.
*   The advisory provides a timeline of vendor contact, indicating the vulnerability was responsibly disclosed.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is described which demonstrates file deletion, which can lead to RCE with more effort to find a suitable payload.
