Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the password recovery mechanism of Umanni RH. The system provides different responses based on whether a user exists with the provided email address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **User Enumeration:** The system reveals whether a given email address is associated with a user account through distinct messages during the password recovery process. Specifically, a message indicating "Email not found" is displayed for invalid email addresses, while valid ones trigger a "You will receive an email..." message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can enumerate valid user accounts.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** By knowing valid usernames/emails, attackers can focus their efforts on brute-forcing passwords or attempting other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is the password reset functionality. An attacker can use the password reset form to test email addresses to determine if they are associated with an active account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The password reset form is available to the general public.
*   **Basic Tooling:** An attacker would need the ability to submit HTTP requests to the password reset endpoint. This can be accomplished with tools readily available in most operating systems or via custom scripts.

**Additional Details:**
The provided GitHub repository ([https://github.com/inflixim4be/User-Enumeration-on-Umanni-RH](https://github.com/inflixim4be/User-Enumeration-on-Umanni-RH)) contains a detailed explanation, including screenshots demonstrating different messages and the process of performing brute-force attacks based on user enumeration. This confirms the issue and makes it easy to understand. The exploit is straight-forward to perform with the password reset form and by simply observing the server's response.
