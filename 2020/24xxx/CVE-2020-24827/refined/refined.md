- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an invalid read in the `dwarf::cursor::skip_form` function at `cursor.cc:181`. This occurs when processing a malformed or crafted ELF file's DWARF debugging information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `dwarf::cursor::skip_form` function attempts to read data from an address that is not mapped, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specific DWARF forms within the ELF file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a segmentation fault and a denial of service (DoS). The program crashes due to the invalid memory access, making it unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious ELF file, specially crafted to trigger the vulnerability during DWARF information parsing.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted ELF file to the vulnerable application.
