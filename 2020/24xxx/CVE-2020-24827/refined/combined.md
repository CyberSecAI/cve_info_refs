## Description

![@xiaoxiongwang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48821972?u=c2953a843eb36275c37e07f8eafe2697ef97e463&v=4&size=48)[xiaoxiongwang](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang)opened [on Aug 15, 2020](https://github.com/aclements/libelfin/issues/47#issue-679568029)

Tested in Ubuntu 16.04, 64bit.

The tested program is the example program dump-lines.

The testcase is [dump\_line\_segv2](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang/function_bugs/blob/master/libelfin/dump_line_segv2).

I use the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-lines dump_line_segv2

```

and got:

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

I use **valgrind** to analysis the bug and get the below information (absolute path information omitted):

```

```

I use **AddressSanitizer** to build ffjpeg and running it with the following command:

```
/path-to-libelfin/examples/dump-lines dump_line_segv2

```

This is the ASAN information (absolute path information omitted):

```

```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious elf file that exploits this bug which will result in a Denial of Service (DoS).
