    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) of the `tcpprep` utility.",
     "attack_vector": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted pcap file using `tcpprep`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed pcap file.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed or crafted network capture file.
