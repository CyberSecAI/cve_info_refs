Subject: various 802.11 security issues - fragattacks.com

Hi,

Several security issues in the 802.11 implementations were found by
Mathy Vanhoef (New York University Abu Dhabi), who has published all
the details at

	<https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/usenix2021.pdf>

and

	<https://www.fragattacks.com/>

For Linux, we've developed the set of patches posted here:

[https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20210511180259.159598-1-johannes@sipsolutions.net/](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/20210511180259.159598-1-johannes%40sipsolutions.net/)

Specifically, the following CVEs were assigned:

 * CVE-2020-24586 - Fragmentation cache not cleared on reconnection
 * CVE-2020-24587 - Reassembling fragments encrypted under different
                    keys
 * CVE-2020-24588 - Accepting non-SPP A-MSDU frames, which leads to
                    payload being parsed as an L2 frame under an
                    A-MSDU bit toggling attack
 * CVE-2020-26139 - Forwarding EAPOL from unauthenticated sender
 * CVE-2020-26140 - Accepting plaintext data frames in protected
                    networks
 * CVE-2020-26141 - Not verifying TKIP MIC of fragmented frames
 * CVE-2020-26142 - Processing fragmented frames as full frames
 * CVE-2020-26143 - Accepting fragmented plaintext frames in
                    protected networks
 * CVE-2020-26144 - Always accepting unencrypted A-MSDU frames that
                    start with RFC1042 header with EAPOL ethertype
 * CVE-2020-26145 - Accepting plaintext broadcast fragments as full
                    frames
 * CVE-2020-26146 - Reassembling encrypted fragments with non-consecutive
                    packet numbers
 * CVE-2020-26147 - Reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments

In general, the scope of these attacks is that they may allow an
attacker to
 * inject L2 frames that they can more or less control (depending on the
   vulnerability and attack method) into an otherwise protected network;
 * exfiltrate (some) network data under certain conditions, this is
   specific to the fragmentation issues.

A subset of these issues is known to apply to the Linux IEEE 802.11
implementation (mac80211). Where it is affected, the attached patches
fix the issues, even if not all of them reference the exact CVE IDs.

In addition, driver and/or firmware updates may be necessary, as well
as potentially more fixes to mac80211, depending on how drivers are
using it.

Specifically, for Intel devices, firmware needs to be updated to the
most recently released versions (which was done without any reference
to the security issues) to address some of the vulnerabilities.

To have a single set of patches, I have included the patches for ath10k
and ath11k drivers in my patch posting linked to above.

We currently don't have information about how other drivers are, if
at all, affected.

Thanks,
johannes

                 CVE-2021-33034

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armel (ARM EABI soft-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
    filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
    images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

    It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
    drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
    drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure.  A local
    user on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    for privilege escalation.  The API has been changed to match
    driver expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host
    (server) implementation which can lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On a system acting as a USB/IP host, a client
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

    Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
    Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem.  A local user permitted to access
    video devices (by default, any member of the "video" group) could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Performing aggregation attack
(CVE-2020-24588) in practice

Mathy Vanhoef

20 January 2021

Aggr. Attack

2

Aggr. Attack

This is the Wi-Fi network we are targeting.

3

Aggr. Attack

This is a server on the internet
under control of the attacker.
For example, a website owned
by the attacker.

4

Aggr. Attack

Visit website
of attacker

Step 1: victim is tricked into connect to the attacker’s server,
for instance by visiting their website. This causes the victim
to create a TCP connection with the attacker’s server.

Note: this doesn’t require code execution on the victim.

5

Aggr. Attack

Visit website
of attacker

Send special
IPv4 packet

Step 2: the attacker’s server sends a special IPv4 packet to
the client over this TCP connection.

This special IPv4 packet contains the “create_msdu_subframe(…, last=True)”
payload that is also sent in the “amsdu-inject[-bad]” test.

6

Aggr. Attack

Visit website
of attacker

Send special
IPv4 packet

Encrypt as
normal frame

The AP will encrypt the special IPv4 packet and sent it to
the client… but the attacker will intercept it first!

7

Aggr. Attack

Visit website
of attacker

Send special
IPv4 packet

Encrypt as
normal frame

Set A-MSDU flag

Step 3: attacker sets the A-MSDU flag and
then forwards the encrypted Wi-Fi frame.

8

Aggr. Attack

Visit website
of attacker

Send special
IPv4 packet

Encrypt as
normal frame

Set A-MSDU flag

2nd subframe contains
injected frame

When victim treats the special IPv4 packet as an A-MSDU,
the 2nd subframe contains the frame we want to inject!

9

Conclusion

We can inject arbitrary network packets, such as DHCP and
ICMPv6 RA packets!

Not a trivial threat model:
› Need to trick victim into connecting to attacker’s server
› Simultaneously need to be within radio range of the victim

But most devices are affected: even if non-trivial, somewhere
this attack is feasible... Patch now before attacks get better.

Introduction
This submission defines a means to allow the protection of A-MSDUs and coexistence with STAs that do not support A-MSDU protection
Interpretation of a Motion to Adopt
A motion to approve this submission means that the editing instructions and any changed or added material are actioned in the TGn Draft. This introduction, is not part of the adopted material.
TGn Editor: Editing instructions preceded by �TGn Editor� are instructions to the TGn editor to modify existing material in the TGn draft. As a result of adopting the changes, the TGn editor will execute the instructions rather than copy them to the TGn Draft.
Summission Note: Notes to the reader of this submission are not part of the motion to adopt. These notes are there to clarify or provide context
CID 289
289��GeneralA-MSDU is a different encapsulation than MSDU, it's designation as an A-MSDU, e.g. QoS bit 7 should be protected to guard against attack that at minimum leads to a flood of traffic even on the wired side.The QoS bit 7 should be protected when dot11HighThroughputOptionImplemented is TRUE and the frame is an A-MSDU.
Proposed Resolution: Counter
Two MIB variables are defined in 11-07-0397, a capability bit, and a policy bit. A truth table is defined for these two bits with respect to each STA and its peer. Some combinations in the truth table lead to QoS bit 7 being protected, some do not.
CID 302
30291198.3.3.3.2To protect A-MSDU, the only addition needed is the inclusion of QoS bit 7 in the AAD construction. So, when using HT Qos bit 7 should not be muted.Suggestion is to define new MIB, dot11AMSDUProtected as a TruthValue in Annex D and change the text in this clause to read " g) QC � QoS Control field, if present, a 2-octet field that includes the MSDU priority. The QC TID and, when dot11AMSDUProtected is TRUE, bit 7 (A-MSDU presence) are is used in the construction of the AAD, and the remaining QC fields are set to 0 for the AAD calculation (bits 4 to 6 and bits 8 to 15 are set to 0).
Proposed Resolution: Counter
This document defines two new MIB variables:
dot11SPPAMSDUCapable which signifies a capability to protect QoS bit 7
dot11SPPAMSDURequired which signifies a policy for whether protect QoS bit 7 must be protected.
CID 643
64391198.3.3Bit 7 is masked out, which may become a problem inviting man-in-middle attacks. It may be flipped by an attacker which causes the receiver to mistake if A-MSDU is present.Protect QoS control field bit 7.
Proposed Resolution: Counter
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. Whether it is protected depends on the capability bit and the policy bit of each STA and its peer. The dependency is defined in the truth table in 11-07-0397.
CID 1117
111791198.3.3.3.2masking the A-MSDU indication in the QoS Control field allows a MITM attack. This bit shold be protectedchange g) to keep bit 7 intact for this calculation
Proposed Resolution: Counter
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. Whether it is protected depends on the capability bit and the policy bit of each STA and its peer. The dependency is defined in the truth table in 11-07-0397
CID 1822
182291208.3.3.3.2The QoS bit 7 should nto be set to zero in makign this calculation, as it leads to a security flaw where rogue devices can recover a pcaket, flip this bit and resend it.Indicate that the A-MSDU Present indicator (QoS bit 7) is not set to zero in making this computation.
Proposed Resolution: Counter
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. Whether it is protected depends on the capability bit and the policy bit of each STA and its peer. The dependency is defined in the truth table in 11-07-0397.
CID 2144
214491218.3.3.3.2The A-MSDU indicator bit (QoS Control field bit 7) should be unmasked in the AAD calculation. As it is currently masked, an attacker can modify the value of this bit without detection, resulting in injection of garbage MSDUs up the stack (i.e. by turning a replayed A-MSDU into an MSDU and vice versa).While it is hard to see how this can be exploited, it is clearly a flaw that is capable of being fixed.Unmask QoS control field bit 7 from the AAD.Note, we have to face up to the reality of the final TGn draft coexisting with large numbers of "pre-N" devices designed to support D2.0 and earlier drafts in circulation. The unmasking needs to be done in a backwards compatible fashion, i.e. using a capability bit set to 1 to indicate the new behaviour.
Proposed Resolution: Accept
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. This submission also provides a means for stations capable of protection QoS bit 7 to interoperate with Draft 2.0 devices.
CID 2835
283591208.3.3.3.2Unmasking of the QoS bit 7 may improve A-MSDU protection but will lead to incompatibility with devices that does not unmask this bitSolve the incompatibility problem
Proposed Resolution: Accept
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. This submission also provides a means for stations capable of protection QoS bit 7 to interoperate with Draft 2.0 devices.
CID 3000
283591208.3.3.3.2Unmasking of the QoS bit 7 may improve A-MSDU protection but will lead to incompatibility with devices that does not unmask this bitSolve the incompatibility problem
Proposed Resolution: Accept
This document defines a mechanism for protecting QoS bit 7 by including it in the AAD. This submission also provides a means for stations capable of protection QoS bit 7 to interoperate with Draft 2.0 devices.
CID 3286
328690�8.3.3.3.2A-MSDU signaling bit (QOS control field bit 7) should be protected by the AAD.Make A-MSDU reception optional.
Proposed Resolution: Reject
Very large numbers of Draft 2.0 devices have been shipped. Those Draft 2.0 devices believe A-MSDU reception is mandatory. Making A-MSDU reception optional would lead to interoperability problems between Draft 2.0 devices and future devices that do not support A-MSDU reception.
CID 298
29866247.3.2.27As A-MSDU should be protected, negotiation for such a capability will be needed. A suggestion is to usurp b3 of the HT Extended Capabilities field to address this.Designate b3 as A-MSDU Protection
Proposed Resolution: Counter
Two different bits were defined in the RSN Capabilities Field to meet the signaling needs proposed in this CID.
SPP A-MSDU Capable
SPP A-MSDU Required
CID 299
2996747.3.2.27As A-MSDU should be protected, negotiation for such a capability will be needed. A suggestion is to usurp b3 of the HT Extended Capabilities field to address this and add its description on table n27Add the following entry: "A-MSDU protection" as the subfield. Definition: "Indicates support for protection of A-MSDU". Encoding: "Set to 0 if not supported. Set to 1 if supported."
Proposed Resolution: Reject
Two different bits were defined in the RSN Capabilities Field to meet the signaling needs proposed in this CID.
SPP A-MSDU Capable
SPP A-MSDU Required
CID 1960
196038�7.1.3.5New use of Bit 7 is not protected in the MIC, resulting in insecure Aggregated MSDU operationEither unmute the bit in the MIC calculation, delete use of Aggregated MSDUs in the QoS context, or developsome other means to prohibit insecure operation.
Proposed Resolution: Counter
This document submission provides the network administrators with the option to unmute the bit in the MIC calculation and it develops some othe rmeans to prohibit insecure operation. It does not delete the use of Aggregated MSDUs in the QoS context.

Proposed Edits
TGn Editor: Include into the TGn draft with the following text:
3. Definitions
Insert the following definitions in their appropriate alphabetical order:
Editorital note: Based on the 802.11-2007 specification, Payload Protected A-MSDU should follow 3.114 and Signaling and Payload Protected A-MSDU should follow 3.135
3.114n Payload Protected A-MSDU (PP A-MSDU): An A-MSDU that is CCMP protected but does not include the A-MSDU Present field (bit 7 of the QoS control field) in the construction of the AAD.
3.135n Signaling and Payload Protected A-MSDU (SPP A-MSDU): An A-MSDU that is CCMP protected and does include the A-MSDU Present field (bit 7 of the Qos control field) in the construction of the AAD.
4.Abbreviations and acronyms
Insert the following acronyms in their alphabetical order:
PP A-MSDU Payload Protected A-MSDU
SPP A-MSDU Signaling and Payload Protected A-MSDU
7.3.2.25.3 RSN capabilities
Replace Figure 91 with the following figure that assigns 2 bits to signal the SPP A-MSDU capability and SPP A-MSDU required bits, changing "Reserved" as appropriate:
Editorial note: the bits are currently positioned in B10 and B11 so as not to collide with other current drafts, but the fields are left as  and  as they are to be assigned by ANA. The actual bit positions will be inserted once the 802.11 ANA has assigned them.

Insert the following text in the appropriate Bit assignment order in 7.3.2.25.3:
�
-- bit  : SPP A-MSDU Capable. A STA sets the SPP A-MSDU Capable subfield of the RSN Capabilities field to 1 to signal that it supports SPP A-MSDU (see 11.18). Otherwise, it shall be set to 0.
-- bit : SPP A-MSDU Required. A STA sets the SPP A-MSDU Required subfield of the RSN Capabilities field to 1 when it disallows (i.e. will not send or receive) PP A-MSDUs . (see 11.18). Otherwise, it shall be set to 0.
8.3.3.3.2 Construct AAD
Replace item " g)" of the last paragraph in 8.3.3.3.2
g) QC � QoS Control field, if present, a 2-octet field that includes the MSDU priority. The QC TID is used in the construction of the AAD, and the remaining QC fields are set to 0 for the AAD calculation (bits 4 to 15 are set to 0).
with the following paragraph:
g) QC � QoS Control field, if present, a 2-octet field that includes the MSDU priority. The QC TID field is used in the construction of the AAD, When both the station and its peer have SPP A-MSDU Capable bits set to TRUE, bit 7 (the A-MSDU Present field) is used in the construction of the AAD, . The remaining QC fields are set to 0 for the AAD calculation (bits 4 to 6, bits 8 to 15, and bit 7 when either the station or its peer has the SPP A-MSDU bit set to FALSE ).
Add new subclause �11.18 RSNA A-MSDU procedures� after �11.17 STA-STA HT Information Exchange�
11.18 RSNA A-MSDU procedures
When dot11RSNAEnabled is TRUE, a STA indicates support for PP A-MSDU or SPP A-MSDU during (re)association. On (re)association, both STA and its peer STA determine and maintain a record of whether an encrypted A-MSDU sent to its peer is to be PP A-MSDU or SPP A-MSDU based on both STAs SPP A-MSDU Capable and SPP A-MSDU Required RSNIE settings.
The SME of an RSNA and HT-capable STA may choose to associate with RSNA STAs with or without the SPP A-MSDU Capable field set in the RSNIE and with or without the SPP A-MSDU Required field set in the RSNIE.
Figure n61-B defines both transmit and receive behaviour of a STA (STA1) that has successfully negotiated an HT and RSNA (re)association with another STA (STA2). Reception and transmission of A-MSDUs on non-RSNA associations is unaffected by the values of the SPP A-MSDU Capable and SPP A-MSDU Required bits.`

This paper discusses 12 vulnerabilities in the 802.11 standard. One vulnerability is in the frame aggregation functionality, two vulnerabilities are in the frame fragmentation functionality, and the other nine are implementation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to forge encrypted frames, which could in turn enable the exfiltration of sensitive data from a targeted device.  This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wifi-faf-22epcEWu>  Affected Products  * Cisco is investigating its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities. As the investigation progresses, Cisco will update this advisory with information about affected products.    Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.       | CVE ID | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release

The firmware-nonfree package has been updated to include addtional firmware
that may be requested by some drivers in Linux 5.10, availble for Debian LTS as
backported kernel.

Some of the updated firmware files adresses security vulnerabilities, which may
allow Escalation of Privileges, Denial of Services and Information Disclosures.

CVE-2020-24586 (INTEL-SA-00473)

    The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA,
    WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require
    that received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting
    to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device
    sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can
    be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user
    data.

CVE-2020-24587  (INTEL-SA-00473)

    The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA,
    WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require
    that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An
    adversary can abuse this to decrypt selected fragments when another
    device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption
    key is periodically renewed.

CVE-2020-24588  (INTEL-SA-00473)

    The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA,
    WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require
    that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is
    authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU
    frames (which is mandatory as part of 802.11n), an adversary can
    abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.

CVE-2021-23168  (INTEL-SA-00621)

    Out of bounds read for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and
    Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow an unauthenticated user to
    potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access.

CVE-2021-23223 (INTEL-SA-00621)

    Improper initialization for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and
    Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially
    enable escalation of privilege via local access.

CVE-2021-37409 (INTEL-SA-00621)

    Improper access control for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and
    Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially
    enable escalation of privilege via local access.

CVE-2021-44545 (INTEL-SA-00621)

    Improper input validation for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and
    Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow an unauthenticated user to
    potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access.

CVE-2022-21181 (INTEL-SA-00621)

    Improper input validation for some Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi and
    Killer(TM) WiFi products may allow a privileged user to potentially
    enable escalation of privilege via local access.

The following advisories are also fixed by this upload, but needs an
updated Linux kernel to load the updated firmware:

CVE-2020-12362 (INTEL-SA-00438)

    Integer overflow in the firmware for some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers
    for Windows * before version 26.20.100.7212 and before Linux kernel
    version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable an
    escalation of privilege via local access.

CVE-2020-12363 (INTEL-SA-00438)

    Improper input validation in some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers for
    Windows* before version 26.20.100.7212 and before Linux kernel
    version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable a
    denial of service via local access.

CVE-2020-12364 (INTEL-SA-00438)

    Null pointer reference in some Intel(R) Graphics Drivers for
    Windows* before version 26.20.100.7212 and before version Linux
    kernel version 5.5 may allow a privileged user to potentially enable
    a denial of service via local access.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
20190114+really20220913-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your firmware-nonfree packages.

### **Description**

This security advisory documents the exposure of Arista’s Wi-Fi products to multiple publicly documented security vulnerabilities related to packet fragmentation and aggregation, known as Fragmentation and Forge. These vulnerabilities impact any deployments using WEP, WPA, WPA2 and WPA3 security methods with any SSID. The vulnerabilities span multiple vectors and types of attack.

The vulnerabilities are documented by Arista under Bug 561363.

| **CVE** | **Description** | **CVSS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2020-24586 | During a connection/reconnection, fragments are cached in memory. This vulnerability can be used to inject fragmented packets; or to exfiltrate user data if the cache is accessed during the connection. | **3.5**  AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N |
| CVE-2020-24587 | When reassembling packets, the encryption key used on fragments is not required to be consistent. As a result, unrelated fragments can be mixed using valid keys. This requires a “Man in the Middle” presence level. | **2.6** AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N |
| CVE-2020-24588 | A payload protected wireless frame (PP A-MSDU) does not protect the Present subfield of the QoS header. As this subfield is not authenticated, the bit can be flipped to alter the aggregation status of the packet. | **3.5** AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26139 | During the authentication process, the AP will forward EAPOL frames, prior to sender completing authentication. Allows for packet injection into an encrypted networking during authentication. | **5.3** AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |
| CVE-2020-26140 | Plaintext data frames are accepted, despite network encryption. Allows for packet injection into an encrypted network. | **6.5** AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26141 | If using Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), the Message Integrity Check (MIC) will be skipped for fragmented frames. Can be leveraged for packet injection and decryption against an encrypted network. This CVE is not applicable to the Arista Wi-Fi Solution. | NA |
| CVE-2020-26142 | AP will treat fragmented frames as full frames. This CVE is not applicable to the Arista Wi-Fi Solution. | NA |
| CVE-2020-26143 | Plaintext data fragments are accepted, despite network encryption. Allows for packet injection into an encrypted network. | **6.5** AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26144 | Plaintext A-MSDU frames are accepted on an encrypted network if the frame begins with an EAPOL LLC/Snap header. Allows for packet injection into an encrypted network. | **6.5** AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26135 | If a fragmented multi-destination packet is received, it will be accepted on encrypted networks if the fragment is plaintext. Allows for packet injection into an encrypted network. | **6.5** AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26146 | Encrypted fragments will be reassembled, even if they do not have consecutive packet numbers. When combined with fragment injection this can cause users to process malicious data. | **5.3** AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N |
| CVE-2020-26147 | Encrypted fragments will be reassembled, even if other fragments have been received plaintext. When combined with fragment injection this can cause users to process malicious data. | **5.4** AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N |

### **Symptoms**

The CVEs discussed primarily create opportunities for packet injection attack vectors:

* Adversaries can inject/cause receipt of arbitrary TCP/IP packets that were never sent by the legitimate client or AP.
* Adversaries can exfiltrate data under specific conditions.
* Adversary can make the victim use the adversary's DNS server and intercept the victim’s traffic.
* Adversaries can get access to victim’s TCP ports that have active services listening (portscan).
* Adversaries may target delivery of illegitimate TCP/IP packets to any routable network devices.
* Adversary may route malicious traffic over operator network (hotspot mode).

### **Vulnerability Assessment**

| CVE-2020-26146 | Y | Y | Y |
| CVE-2020-26147 | N | N | Y |

**Mitigation**

As a security best practice, it is recommended to restrict public access to internal devices to safeguard from potential attacks. A machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is required to reliably exploit many of these vulnerabilities (except those applicable to the hotspot scenarios). In this type of attack the adversary sets up a clone of the real AP on a different channel and the client connects to this attacker’s clone instead of the real AP. This enables the attacker to block or modify 802.11 frames.

Arista Access Points are already capable of detecting Rogue APs spoofing the MAC address of a legitimate AP. They can also launch an automatic mitigation session in some cases to prevent legitimate clients from connecting to the Rogue AP. Arista AP models equipped with a dedicated scanning radio are capable of this detection and prevention features by scanning the entire spectrum.

Arista overlay WIPS solution can also detect and mitigate the Rogue AP spoofing attacks.

We recommend enabling the following WIPS settings if they are not already enabled:

**Configure > Alerts > MAC Spoofing > AP MAC Spoofing**

Enable “Display” and “Affects Security Status”:

**Configure > WIPS > Automatic Intrusion Detection > MAC Spoofing**

Enable “Spoofing of an Authorized Access Point MAC address”:

As a full resolution against this vulnerability, refer to the next section for remediated software versions and hotfix details.

**Resolution**

This vulnerability is tracked by Bug 561363 and can manifest in any environment leveraging WEP, WPA, WPA2 and WPA3 security methods with any SSID for encryption. Arista is actively working with our chip vendors on incorporating fixes into Arista CloudVision Wi-Fi AP software. A new AP software version which addresses the above vulnerabilities will be released by Arista. This will be a regular upgrade similar to other new version upgrades. Arista will notify all customers and partners once the new version with the fixes is released and available. The recommended course of action is to install the provided hotfix or upgrade to a remediated CloudVision Wi-Fi AP software version once available.

# Summary of Vulnerabilities

## Design Flaws

* **CVE-2020-24588: Accepting non-SPP A-MSDU frames**: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SPP A-MSDU frames, which is mandatory as part of 802.11n, an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
* **CVE-2020-24587: Reassembling fragments encrypted under different keys**: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
* **CVE-2020-24586: Not clearing fragments from memory when (re)connecting to a network:** The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments must be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.

## Implementation flaws allowing trivial packet injection

* **CVE-2020-26145: Accepting plaintext broadcast fragments as full frames (in an encrypted network)**: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
* **CVE-2020-26144: Accepting plaintext A-MSDU frames that start with an RFC1042 header with EtherType EAPOL (in an encrypted network)**: Vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
* **CVE-2020-26140: Accepting plaintext data frames in a protected network**: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.
* **CVE-2020-26143: Accepting *fragmented* plaintext data frames in a protected network**: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept fragmented plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.

## Other Implementation Vulnerabilities

* **CVE-2020-26139: Forwarding EAPOL frames even though the sender is not yet authenticated**: Vulnerable Access Points (APs) forward EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. An adversary might be able to abuse this in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients, and this makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.
* **CVE-2020-26146: Reassembling encrypted fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers**: Vulnerable WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design.
* **CVE-2020-26147: Reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments**: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
* **CVE-2020-26142: Processing fragmented frames as full frames**: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations treat fragmented frames as full frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets, independent of the network configuration.
* **CVE-2020-26141: Not verifying the TKIP MIC of fragmented frames**: Vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations do not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol.

Debian Bug     : 986949 988352 989451

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3506

    The ADLab of venustech discovered a bug in the F2FS driver which
    could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a crafted
    filesystem.  A local user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash) or other
    security impact.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29155, CVE-2021-31829

    Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the Extended
    BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information
    leaks due to speculative execution.  A local user could exploit
    these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.194-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#986949, #988352, and #989451; and includes many more bug fixes from

SUMMARY

Twelve vulnerabilities in the implementation of frame aggregation and fragmentation of the 802.11
standard, under the name of FragAttacks, have been published.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker within Wi-Fi range to forge encrypted
frames, which could result in sensitive data disclosure and possibly trafﬁc manipulation.

The advised Siemens products are only affected by some of the published vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As these vulnerabilities can only be exploited within Wi-Fi range, when possible reduce Wi-Fi
transmission power or make sure to have the devices in private areas with physical access controls

SSA-913875

© Siemens 2022

Page 10 of 14

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

• When possible, A-MSDU can be disabled to mitigate CVE-2020-24588 and CVE-2020-26144

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

SCALANCE W-1700 products are wireless communication devices based on IEEE 802.11 standards.
They are used to connect all to sorts of WLAN devices (Access Points or Clients, depending on the
operating mode) with a strong focus on industrial components, like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and others.

The SCALANCE W1750D controller-based Direct Access Points support radio transmission according to
the latest IWLAN standard IEEE 802.11ac Wave 2.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-24588

The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn’t require that the A-MSDU ﬂag in the plaintext QoS header ﬁeld is
authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SSP A-MSDU frames (which is mandatory
as part of 802.11n), an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-26139

An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames
to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might
be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients
and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.

# Summary of Vulnerabilities
## Design Flaws
- \*\*CVE-2020-24588: Accepting non-SPP A-MSDU frames\*\*: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that the A-MSDU flag in the plaintext QoS header field is authenticated. Against devices that support receiving non-SPP A-MSDU frames, which is mandatory as part of 802.11n, an adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets.
- \*\*CVE-2020-24587: Reassembling fragments encrypted under different keys\*\*: The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that all fragments of a frame are encrypted under the same key. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP encryption key is periodically renewed.
- \*\*CVE-2020-24586: Not clearing fragments from memory when (re)connecting to a network:\*\* The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that received fragments must be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user data.
## Implementation flaws allowing trivial packet injection
- \*\*CVE-2020-26145: Accepting plaintext broadcast fragments as full frames (in an encrypted network)\*\*: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext and process them as full unfragmented frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26144: Accepting plaintext A-MSDU frames that start with an RFC1042 header with EtherType EAPOL (in an encrypted network)\*\*: Vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations accept plaintext A-MSDU frames as long as the first 8 bytes correspond to a valid RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP) header for EAPOL. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets independent of the network configuration.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26140: Accepting plaintext data frames in a protected network\*\*: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26143: Accepting \_fragmented\_ plaintext data frames in a protected network\*\*: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations accept fragmented plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary data frames independent of the network configuration.
## Other Implementation Vulnerabilities
- \*\*CVE-2020-26139: Forwarding EAPOL frames even though the sender is not yet authenticated\*\*: Vulnerable Access Points (APs) forward EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. An adversary might be able to abuse this in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients, and this makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26146: Reassembling encrypted fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers\*\*: Vulnerable WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26147: Reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments\*\*: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments even though some of them were sent in plaintext. This vulnerability can be abused to inject packets and/or exfiltrate selected fragments when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26142: Processing fragmented frames as full frames\*\*: Vulnerable WEP, WPA, WPA2, or WPA3 implementations treat fragmented frames as full frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject arbitrary network packets, independent of the network configuration.
- \*\*CVE-2020-26141: Not verifying the TKIP MIC of fragmented frames\*\*: Vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations do not verify the Message Integrity Check (authenticity) of fragmented TKIP frames. An adversary can abuse this to inject and possibly decrypt packets in WPA or WPA2 networks that support the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol.

## [Introduction](#intro)

11 May 2021 —
This website presents FragAttacks (**fr**agmentation
and **ag**gregation **attacks**) which is a collection of new
security vulnerabilities that affect Wi-Fi devices. An adversary that is within range of a victim's Wi-Fi network can abuse these
vulnerabilities to steal user information or attack devices. Three of the discovered vulnerabilities are design flaws in the
Wi-Fi standard and therefore affect most devices. On top of this, several other vulnerabilities were discovered that are
caused by widespread programming mistakes in Wi-Fi products. Experiments indicate that every Wi-Fi product is affected
by at least one vulnerability and that most products are affected by several vulnerabilities.

The discovered vulnerabilities affect all modern security protocols of Wi-Fi, including the latest WPA3 specification.
Even the original security protocol of Wi-Fi, called WEP, is affected. This means that several of the newly discovered
design flaws have been part of Wi-Fi since its release in 1997!
Fortunately, the **design flaws are hard to abuse** because doing so requires user interaction or is only
possible when using uncommon network settings.
As a result, in practice the **biggest concern are the programming mistakes in Wi-Fi products** since
several of them are trivial to exploit.

The discovery of these vulnerabilities comes as a surprise, because the security of Wi-Fi has in fact significantly
improved over the past years.
For instance, previously we discovered the [KRACK attacks](https://www.krackattacks.com/), the defenses
against KRACK were [proven secure](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/cremers),
and the latest WPA3 security specification has [improved](https://www.wi-fi.org/file/wi-fi-security-roadmap-and-wpa3-updates-december-2020).
Unfortunately, a feature that could have prevented one of the newly discovered design flaws was not adopted in practice,
and the other two design flaws are present in a feature of Wi-Fi that was previously not widely studied.
This shows it stays important to analyze even the most well-known security protocols (if you want to help,
we are [hiring](#hiring)). Additionally, it shows that it's essential to regularly
test Wi-Fi products for security vulnerabilities, which can for instance be done when certifying them.

To protect users, security updates were prepared during a 9-month-long coordinated disclosure that was supervised by
the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://www.wi-fi.org/security-update-fragmentation) and
[ICASI](https://www.icasi.org/aggregation-fragmentation-attacks-against-wifi/). If updates for your device
are not yet available, you can [mitigate](#notpatched) some attacks (but not all)
by assuring that websites use HTTPS and by assuring that your devices received all other available updates.

The research will be presented at the [USENIX Security](#usenixpres) conference and a longer talk with more background will also be given at
[Black Hat USA](https://blackhat.com/us-21/briefings/schedule/index.html#fragattacks-breaking-wi-fi-through-fragmentation-and-aggregation-23518)
this summer.

## [Demo](#demo)

The following video shows three examples of how an adversary can abuse the vulnerabilities. First,
the aggregation design flaw is abused to intercept sensitive information (e.g. the victim's username and password).
Second, it's shown how an adversary can exploit insecure internet-of-things
devices by remotely turning on and off a smart power socket. Finally, it's demonstrated how the
vulnerabilities can be abused as a stepping stone to launch advanced attacks. In particular, the video shows how an adversary
can take over an outdated Windows 7 machine inside a local network.

As the demo illustrates, the Wi-Fi flaws can be abused in two ways. First, under the right conditions they can be abused
to steal sensitive data. Second, an adversary can abuse the Wi-Fi flaws to attack devices in someone's home network.

The biggest risk in practice is likely the ability to abuse the discovered flaws to attack devices in someone's home network.
For instance, many smart home and [internet-of-things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Consumer_applications)
devices are rarely updated, and Wi-Fi security is the last line of defense that prevents someone from attacking
these devices. Unfortunately, due to the discover vulnerabilities, this last line of defense can now be bypassed.
In the demo above, this is illustrated by remotely controlling a smart power plug and by taking over an outdated Windows 7 machine.

The Wi-Fi flaws can also be abused to exfiltrate transmitted data. The demo shows how this can be abused to learn
the username and password of the victim when they use the NYU website. However, when a website is configured with
[HSTS](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/websites-hsts) to always
use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) as an extra layer of security, which nowadays
[close](https://www.troyhunt.com/padlocks-phishing-and-privacy-the-value-proposition-of-a-vpn/#1-https-still-has-a-long-way-to-go)
[to](https://twitter.com/Scott_Helme/status/1305605547106983951)
[20%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-hsts) of websites are,
the transmitted data cannot be stolen.
Additionally, several browsers now [warn](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure)
the user when HTTPS is not being used.
Finally, although [not always](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/oltrogge) perfect,
recent mobile apps by default use HTTPS and therefore also use this extra protection.

### [Presentations](#presentations)

If you don't want to read the following text, you can also watch my [USENIX Security](#usenixpres)
or [WAC4](#wac4pres) presentation.

### [Plaintext injection vulnerabilities](#plaininject)

Several implementation flaws can be abused to easily inject frames into a protected Wi-Fi network. In particular, an adversary
can often inject an unencrypted Wi-Fi frame by carefully constructing this frame. This can for instance be abused to
intercept a client's traffic by tricking the client into using a [malicious DNS server](#extradocs) as shown in the
[demo](#demo) (the intercepted traffic may have [another layer of protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) though).
Against routers this can also be abused to [bypass the NAT/firewall](#extadocs), allowing the adversary to
subsequently attack devices in the local Wi-Fi network (e.g. attacking an outdated Windows 7 machine as shown in the [demo](#demo)).

How can the adversary construct unencrypted Wi-Fi frames so they are accepted by a vulnerable device?
First, certain Wi-Fi devices **accept any unencrypted frame even when connected to a protected Wi-Fi network**.
This means the attacker doesn't have to do anything special!
Two of out of four tested home routers were affected by this vulnerability, several internet-of-things devices were affected,
and some smartphones were affected. Additionally, many Wi-Fi dongles on Windows will wrongly accept plaintext frames when
they are split into several (plaintext) fragments.

Additionally, certain devices **accept plaintext aggregated frames that look like handshake messages**.
An adversary can exploit this by sending an aggregated frame whose starts resembles a handshake message and whose second
subframe contains the packet that the adversary wants to inject.
A vulnerable device will first interpret this frame as a handshake message, but will subsequently process it as an aggregated frame.
In a sense, one part of the code will think the frame is a handshake message and will accept it even though it's not encrypted.
Another part of the code will instead see it as an aggregated frame and will process the packet that the adversary wants to inject.

![](images/tenor.gif)

A plaintext aggregated frame that also looks like a handshake message ☺

Finally, several devices process broadcasted fragments as normal unfragmented frames. More problematic, some devices
**accept broadcast fragments even when sent unencrypted**.
An attacker can abuse this to inject packets by encapsulating them in the second fragment of a plaintext broadcast frame.

### [Design flaw: aggregation attack](#aggregationattack "CVE-2020-24588")

The first design flaw is in the frame aggregation feature of Wi-Fi. This feature increases the speed and throughput of a network
by combining small frames into a larger aggregated frame. To implement this feature, the header of each frame contains a flag that
indicates whether the (encrypted) transported data contains a single or aggregated frame. This is illustrated in the following figure:

Unfortunately,
this **"is aggregated" flag is not authenticated** and can be modified by an adversary, meaning a victim can
be tricked into processing the encrypted transported data in an unintended manner. An adversary can abuse this to inject
arbitrary network packets by tricking the victim into connecting to their server and then setting the "is aggregated" flag
of carefully selected packets. Practically all tested devices were vulnerable to this attack. The ability to inject packets
can in turn be abused to intercept a victim’s traffic by making it use a malicious DNS server (see the [demo](#demo)).

This design flaw can be fixed by authenticating the "is aggregated" flag. The Wi-Fi standard already contains a feature to
authenticate this flag, namely requiring SPP A-MSDU frames, but this defense is not backwards-compatible and not supported
in practice. Attacks can also be mitigated using an ad-hoc fix, though new attacks may remain possible.

### [Design flaw: mixed key attack](#mixedkeyattack "CVE-2020-24587")

The second design flaw is in the frame fragmentation feature of Wi-Fi. This feature increases the reliability of a connection
by splitting large frames into smaller fragments. When doing this, every fragment that belongs to the
same frame is encrypted using the same key. However, receivers are not required to check this and will **reassemble fragments
that were decrypted using different keys**.
Under rare conditions this can be abused to exfiltrate data. This is accomplished by mixing fragments that are encrypted under different keys,
as illustrated in the following figure:

In the above figure, the first fragment received by the access point is decrypted using a different key
than the second fragment. Nevertheless, the victim will reassemble both fragments. In practice this allows
an adversary to exfiltrate selected client data.

This design flaw can be fixed in a backwards-compatible manner by only reassembling fragments
that were decrypted using the same key.
Because the attack is only possible under rare conditions **it is considered a theoretical attack**.

### [Design flaw: fragment cache attack](#fragcacheattack "CVE-2020-24586")

The third design flaw is also in Wi-Fi's frame fragmentation feature. The problem is that, when a client disconnects
from the network, the Wi-Fi device is **not required to remove non-reassembled fragments from memory**.
This can be abused against hotspot-like networks such as [eduroam and govroam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduroam)
and against enterprise network where users distrust each other. In those cases, selected data sent by the victim can be
exfiltrated. This is achieved by injecting a malicious fragment in the memory (i.e. fragment cache) of the access point.
When the victim then connects to the access point and sends a fragmented frame, selected fragments will be combined (i.e. reassembled)
with the injected fragment of the adversary. This is illustrated in the following figure:

In the above figure, the adversary injects the first fragment into the fragment cache of the access point. After the
adversary disconnects the fragment stays in the fragment cache and will be reassembled with a fragment of the victim.
If the victim sends fragmented frames, which appears uncommon in practice, this can be abused to exfiltrate data.

This design flaw can be fixed in a backwards-compatible manner by removing fragments from memory whenever disconnecting
or (re)connecting to a network.

### [Other implementation vulnerabilities](#codeflaws)

Some routers will forward handshake frames to another client even when the sender hasn't
authenticated yet. This vulnerability allows an adversary to perform the aggregation attack,
and inject arbitrary frames, without user interaction.

Another extremely common implementation flaw is that receivers do not check whether all
fragments belong to the same frame, meaning an adversary can trivially forge frames by mixing the fragments of two
different frames.

Additionally, against several implementations it is possible to mix encrypted and plaintext fragments.

Finally, some devices don't support fragmentation or aggregation, but are still vulnerable to attacks
because they process fragmented frames as full frames. Under the right circumstances this
can be abused to inject packets.

### [Assigned CVE identifiers](#cves)

An overview of all assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/blob/master/SUMMARY.md),
and there is a list of [known advisories](https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/blob/master/ADVISORIES.md) from companies.
Summarized, the design flaws were assigned the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2020-24588](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24588): aggregation attack (accepting non-SPP A-MSDU frames).
* [CVE-2020-24587](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24587): mixed key attack (reassembling fragments encrypted under different keys).
* [CVE-2020-24586](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24586): fragment cache attack (not clearing fragments from memory when (re)connecting to a network).

Implementation vulnerabilities that allow the trivial injection of plaintext frames in a protected Wi-Fi network are assigned the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2020-26145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26145): Accepting plaintext broadcast fragments as full frames (in an encrypted network).
* [CVE-2020-26144](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26144): Accepting plaintext A-MSDU frames that start with an RFC1042 header with EtherType EAPOL (in an encrypted network).
* [CVE-2020-26140](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26140): Accepting plaintext data frames in a protected network.
* [CVE-2020-26143](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26143): Accepting fragmented plaintext data frames in a protected network.

Other implementation flaws are assigned the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2020-26139](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26139): Forwarding EAPOL frames even though the sender is not yet authenticated (should only affect APs).
* [CVE-2020-26146](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26146): Reassembling encrypted fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers.
* [CVE-2020-26147](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26147): Reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments.
* [CVE-2020-26142](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26142): Processing fragmented frames as full frames.
* [CVE-2020-26141](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26141): Not verifying the TKIP MIC of fragmented frames.

For each implementation vulnerability we listed the reference CVE identifier.
Although each affected codebase normally receives a unique CVE,
the agreement between affected vendors was that, in this specific case,
using the same CVE across different codebases would make communication easier.
For instance, by tying one CVE to each vulnerability, a customer can now ask a vendor
whether their product is affected by a specific CVE.

Please note that this deviates from normal MITRE guidelines, and that this decision was made
by affected vendors independently of MITRE, and that this in no way reflects any changes in how MITRE assigns CVEs.

### [Extra Documents](#extadocs)

* An [overview](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/fragattacks-overview.pdf) of all
  **attacks and their preconditions**. It also contains two extra examples on how an
  adversary can: (1) abuse packet injection vulnerabilities to make a victim use a malicious DNS; and
  (2) how packet injection can be abused to bypass the NAT/firewall of a router.
* [Slides](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/fragattacks-slides-amsdu.pdf) illustrating
  how the aggregation attack (CVE-2020-24588) works in practice. Performing this attack requires tricking
  the victim into connecting to the adversary's server. This can be done by making the victim download an
  image from the adversary’s server. Note that JavaScript code execution on the victim is not required.

    illustrating only the root cause of each discovered vulnerability.

## [Tools](#tools)

A [tool was made](https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks) that can test if clients or APs are
affected by the discovered design and implementations flaws. It can test home networks and enterprise networks where
authentication is done using, e.g., PEAP-MSCHAPv2 or EAP-TLS. The **tool supports over 45 test cases** and requires modified
drivers in order to reliable test for the discovered vulnerabilities. Without modified drivers, one may wrongly conclude
that a device is not affected while in reality it is.

A **live USB image** is [also available](https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks#id-live-image).
This image contains pre-installed modified drivers, modified firmware for certain Atheros USB dongles, and a
pre-configured Python environment for the tool. Using a live image is useful when you cannot install the modified
drivers natively (and using a virtual machine can be unreliable for some network cards).

Apart from a tool to test if a device is vulnerable I also made proof-of-concepts to exploit weaknesses. Because not all
devices currently have received updates these attacks scripts will be released at a later point if deemed useful.

### [Why did nobody notice the aggregation design flaw before?](#ieeenoticed)

When the 802.11n amendment was being written in 2007, which introduced supported for aggregated (A-MSDU) frames,
[several IEEE members](https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/07/11-07-0397-07-000n-msdu-protection.doc)
noticed that the "is aggregated" flag was not authenticated. Unfortunately, many products already implemented
a draft of the 802.11n amendment, meaning this problem had to be addressed in a backwards-compatible manner.
The decision was made that devices would advertise whether they are capable of authenticating the "is aggregated"
flag. Only when devices implement and advertise this capability is the "is aggregated" flag protected. Unfortunately,
in 2020 not a single tested device supported this capability, likely because it was considered hard to exploit.
[To quote](https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/07/11-07-0397-07-000n-msdu-protection.doc) a remark
made back in 2007:
*"While it is hard to see how this can be exploited, it is clearly a flaw that is capable of being fixed."*

In other words, people did notice this vulnerability and a defense was standardized, but in practice the defense
was never adopted. This is a good example that security defenses must be adopted before attacks become practical.

### [Why was the defense against the aggregation attack (CVE-2020-24588) not adopted?](#whynotadopted)

Likely because it was only considered a theoretic vulnerability when the defense was created.
[To quote](https://mentor.ieee.org/802.11/dcn/07/11-07-0397-07-000n-msdu-protection.doc) a remark
made back in 2007:
*"While it is hard to see how this can be exploited, it is clearly a flaw that is capable of being fixed."*

Additionally, the threat model that was used in the aggregation attack, were the victim is induced into connecting to the
adversary's server, only become widely accepted in 2011 after the disclosure of the [BEAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack)
attack. In other words, the threat model was not yet widely known back in 2007 when the IEEE added the optional feature
that would have prevented the attack. And even after this threat model became more common,
the resulting attack isn't obvious.

### [My device isn't patched yet, what can I do?](#notpatched)

First, it's always good to remember general security best practices: update your devices, don't reuse your passwords,
make sure you have backups of important data, don't visit shady websites, and so on.

In regards to the discovered Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, you can mitigate attacks that exfiltrate sensitive data by
double-checking that websites you are visiting
[use HTTPS](https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure).
Even better, you can install the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) plugin. This plugin
forces the usage of HTTPS on websites that are known to support it.

To mitigate attacks where your router's NAT/firewall is bypassed and devices are directly attacked, you must assure that
all your devices are updated. Unfortunately, not all products regularly receive updates, in particular smart or internet-of-things
devices, in which case it is difficult (if not impossible) to properly secure them.

More technically, the impact of attacks can also be reduced by manually configuring your DNS server so that it cannot be poisoned.
Specific to your Wi-Fi configuration, you can mitigate attacks (but not fully prevent them) by disabling fragmentation,
disabling pairwise rekeys, and disabling dynamic fragmentation in Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) devices.

### [Does using EAP-TLS increase the difficulty of attacks?](#eaptls)

No. All attacks are possible no matter how the client authenticates the network. In other words, attacks are identical
against home and enterprise networks. Moreover, it doesn't matter which EAP method you use in an enterprise network:
all attacks remain possible and can be abused in exactly the same manner.

Important to remark is that exploiting the design flaws relies on a multi-channel machine-in-the-middle position
(and abusing CVE-2020-26146 relies on this MitM as well). This MitM is not a traditional rogue AP. Instead, the attacker
is copying all frames from the real AP to a different Wi-Fi channel. This can be done no matter which authentication method
the network is using. You can read more about this MitM in
[my blog post](https://www.mathyvanhoef.com/2021/05/fragattacks-clarifying-some-aspects.html#rogue-ap).

### [Does using 802.11w help mitigate attacks?](#mfp)

No. Using 802.11w, also known as management frame protection, has no impact on any of the attacks. Even attacks that rely
on the multi-channel machine-in-the-middle position (i.e. the design flaws and CVE-2020-26146) remain possible when using 802.11w.
This is because this MitM isn't established
by sending deauthentication or disassociation frames to first disconnect the client from the network. Instead, to establish
this MitM, the attacker forces the client to switch to another channel. This is accomplished by spoofing beacon frames
that contain malicious Channel Switch Announcements. These beacon frames can be spoofed even when 802.11w is enabled, meaning
that enabling 802.11w won't make attacks harder.

You can read more about the multi-channel MitM in
[my blog post](https://www.mathyvanhoef.com/2021/05/fragattacks-clarifying-some-aspects.html#rogue-ap).
This MitM can be established in precisely the same manner whether or not 802.11w is used.

### [Why is Wi-Fi security important? We already have HTTPS.](#whyimportant)

These days a lot of websites and apps use [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to encrypt data.
When using HTTPS, an adversary cannot see the data you are transmitting even when you are connected to an open Wi-Fi network.
This also means that you can safely use open Wi-Fi hotspots as long as you keep your devices up-to-date and as long as you assure
that websites are using HTTPS. Unfortunately, not all websites require the usage of HTTPS (i.e. they're not using
[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)), meaning they remain
vulnerable to possible attacks.

At home, the security of your Wi-Fi network is also essential. An insecure network means that others might be able
to connect to the internet through your home. Additionally, more and more devices are using Wi-Fi to transfer personal
files in your local network without an extra layer of protection (e.g. when printing files, smart display screens, when
sending files to a local backup storage, digital photo stands, and so on). More problematic, a lot of internet-of-things devices have tons
of security vulnerabilities that can be exploited if an adversary can communicate with them. The main thing that prevents
an adversary from exploiting these insecure internet-of-things devices is the security of your Wi-Fi network. It therefore
remains essential to have strong encryption and authentication at the Wi-Fi layer.

At work, the security of Wi-Fi is also essential for the same reasons as mentioned above. Additionally, many
companies will automatically allow access to sensitive services when a user (or adversary) is able to
connect to the Wi-Fi network. Therefore strong Wi-Fi security is also essential in a work setting.

### [Will using a VPN prevent attacks?](#vpn)

Using a VPN can prevent attacks where an adversary is trying to exfiltrate data. It will not prevent an
adversary from bypassing your router's NAT/firewall to directly attack devices.

### [How did you discover this?](#howfound)

The seeds of this research were already planted while I was investigating the [KRACK attack](https://krackattacks.com).
At that time, on 8 June 2017 to be
precise, I wrote down some notes to further investigate (de)fragmentation support in Linux. In particular, I thought there might be an
implementation vulnerability in Linux. However, a single unconfirmed implementation flaw isn't too spectacular research-wise, so after disclosing
the KRACK attack I decided to work on other research instead. The idea of inspecting (de)fragmentation in Wi-Fi, and determining whether
there really was a vulnerability or not, was always at the back of my mind though.

Fast-forward three years later, and after gaining some additional ideas to investigate, closer inspection confirmed some of my hunches
and also revealed that these issues were more widespread than I initially assumed. And with some extra insights I also discovered all
the other vulnerabilities. Interestingly, this also shows the advantage of fleshing out ideas before rushing to publish (though actually
finishing the paper before submission was still a race against time..).

### [How sure are you that all Wi-Fi devices are affected?](#allaffected)

In experiments on more than 75 devices, all of them were vulnerable to one or more of the discovered attacks.
I'm curious myself whether *all* devices in the whole world are indeed affected though! To find this out, if you
find a device that isn't affected by at least one of the discovered vulnerabilities, let me know.

Also, if your company provides Wi-Fi devices and you think that your product was not affected by any of the discovered vulnerabilities,
you can send your product to me. Once I confirmed that it indeed was not affected by any vulnerabilities the name of
your product and company will be put here! Note that I do need a method to assure that I'm indeed testing a version
of the product that was available before the disclosure of the vulnerabilities (and that you didn't silently patch
some vulnerabilities).

### [Does this mean every Wi-Fi device is trivial to attack?](#istrivial)

The design issues are, on their own, tedious to exploit in practice. Unfortunately, some of the implementation
vulnerabilities are common and trivial to exploit. Additionally, by combining the design issues with certain implementation
issues, the resulting attacks become more serious. This means the impact of our findings depends on the specific
target. Your vendor can inform you what the precise impact is for specific devices. In other words, for some devices
the impact is minor, while for others it's disastrous.

### [How many networks use fragmentation?](#usagefrag)

By default devices don't send fragmented frames. This means that the mixed key attack and the fragment cache attack,
on their own, will be hard to exploit in practice, unless Wi-Fi 6 is used. When using Wi-Fi 6, which is based on the
802.11ax standard, a device may dynamically fragment frames to fill up available airtime.

### [How many networks periodically refresh the pairwise session key?](#usagerenew)

By default access points don't renew the pairwise session key, even though some may periodically renew the group key.
This means that the default mixed key attack as described in the paper is only possible against networks that deviate from
this default setting.

### [Isn't it irresponsible to release tools to perform the attacks?](#abusetools)

The test tool that we released can only be used to test whether a device is vulnerable. It cannot be used
to perform attacks: an adversary would have to write their own tools for that. This approach enables network
administrators to test if devices are affected while reducing the chance of someone abusing the released code.

### [Where are all the attack tools?](#attacktools)

The code that has currently been released focusses on *detecting* vulnerable implementations. The proof-of-concepts
scripts that perform actual attacks are not released to provide everyone with more time to implement and deploy patches.
Once a large enough fraction of devices has been patched, and if deemed necessary and/or beneficial, the attack script
will be publicly released as well.

### [Do you have example network captures of the vulnerabilities?](#captures)

There are example [network captures](https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/tree/master/example-pcaps) of the
[test tool](#tools) that illustrate the root causes of several vulnerabilities.

### [How long will you maintain the driver patches needed to run the test scripts?](#maintaindriver)

The modifications to certain drivers have been submitted upstream to Linux meaning they will be maintained by the Linux developers
themselves. The patches to the Intel driver have not been submitted upstream because they're a bit hacky. Concretely, this means that
drivers such as ath9k\_htc will be supported out of the box, while for Intel devices you will have to use patched drivers and I'm not
sure how much time I'll have to maintain those.

### [Why are so many implementations vulnerable to be non-consecutive PN attack?](#nonsecdesign)

That's a good question. I'm not sure why so many developers missed this. This widespread implementation vulnerability
does highlight that leaving important cryptographic operations up to developers is not ideal. Put another way, it might
have been better if the standard required an authenticity check over the reassembled frame instead. That would also better
follow the principle of authenticated encryption.

### [Why are so many implementations vulnerable to the mixed plaintext/encrypted fragment attack?](#mixeddesign)

The 802.11 standard states in section 10.6: "If security encapsulation has been applied to the fragment, it shall be
deencapsulated and decrypted before the fragment is used for defragmentation of the MSDU or MMPDU". There is unfortunately
no warning that unencrypted *fragments* should be dropped. And there are no recommend checks that should be
performed when reassembling two (decrypted) fragments.

### [Can an implementation be vulnerable to a cache attack without being vulnerable to a mixed key attack?](#cachenotmixed)

Yes, although this is unlikely to occur in practice. More technically, let's assume that an implementation tries to prevent mixed key
attacks by: (1) assigning an unique key ID to every fragment; (2) incrementing this key ID whenever the pairwise transient
key (PTK) is updated; and (3) assuring all fragments were decrypted under the same key ID. Unfortunately, in that case
cache attacks may still be feasible. In particular, if under this defense key IDs are reused
after (re)connecting to a network, for example because they are reset to zero, fragments that are decrypted
using a different key may still be assigned the same key ID. As a result, cache attacks remain possible, because the
fragments will still be reassembled as they have the same key ID.

### [Can the mixed-key attack be prevented in a backward-compatible manner?](#mixedbackward)

Strictly speaking not, because the 802.11 standard does not explicitly require that a sender encrypts all fragments
of a specific frame under the same key. Fortunately, all implementations that we tested did encrypt all fragments using
the same key, at least under the normal circumstances that we tested, meaning in practice the mixed key attack can be
prevented without introducing incompatibilities.

### [Is the old WPA-TKIP protocol also affected by the design flaws?](#tkip)

Strictly speaking not, though implementations can still be vulnerable. Note that TKIP should not be used because it
is affected by other more serious security flaws. Additionally, TKIP has been
[deprecated](https://www.wi-fi.org/file/technical-note-removal-of-tkip-from-wi-fi-devices) by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

The TKIP protocol is not affected by the fragmentation-based design flaws (CVE-2020-24587 and CVE-2020-24586) because it
verifies the authenticity of the full reassembled frame. This is in contrast to CCMP and GCMP,
which only verify the authenticity of individual fragments, and rely on sequential packet numbers to securely reassemble
the individual (decrypted) fragments.

Additionally, TKIP is not affected by the aggregation design flaw (CVE-2020-24588) because a receiver is supposed
to drop A-MSDUs that are encrypted using TKIP. Indeed, in Section "12.9.2.8 Per-MSDU/Per-A-MSDU Rx pseudocode"
of the [802.11-2016](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_11-2016.html) standard it's specified that
when using TKIP only normal MSDU frames are accepted.

Unfortunately, some implementations don't verify the authenticity of fragmented TKIP frames, and some accept aggregated
frames (i.e. A-MSDUs) even when encrypted using TKIP. This unfortunately means that in practice TKIP implementations
may still be vulnerable.

### [Is the ancient WEP protocol also affected by the design flaws?](#wep)

Yes. The WEP protocol is so horrible that it doesn't even try to verify the authenticity of fragmented frames.
This means an adversary can trivially perform aggregation-based attacks against WEP.

Similar to TKIP, the WEP protocol is not affected by the aggregation design flaw (CVE-2020-24588)
because a receiver is supposed to drop A-MSDUs that are encrypted using WEP. Nevertheless, in practice several
WEP implementations do accept A-MSDUs and therefore are still vulnerable.

Finally, in case you've been living under a rock, stop using WEP, it's known to be a
[horrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy#Weak_security) security protocol.

### [Can fragmentation attacks be preventing by disallowing small delays between fragments?](#fragdelays)

This would make exploiting possible vulnerabilities harder and perhaps in some cases practically infeasible.
Unfortunately this doesn't provide any guarantees though. I therefore recommend to fix the root cause instead.

### [Are patches for Linux available?](#patchlinux)

Yes! During the embargo I helped write some patches for the Linux kernel. This means an updated Linux kernel should (soon) be
available for actively supported Linux distributions.

### [Did others also discover the plaintext injection issue (CVE-2020-26140)?](#plainothers)

During the embargo I was made aware that [Synopsys also discoveredthe plaintext injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-26140) in access points. They found that Mediatek, Realtek, and Qualcomm were
affected, and to cover these three implementations the identifiers
[CVE-2019-18989](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-18989),
[CVE-2019-18990](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-18990), and
[CVE-2019-18991](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-18991) were respectively assigned.](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-sept2020/)

During the FragAttacks research I found that the same vulnerability was (still) present in other access points and that clients
can be vulnerable to a similar attack. Additionally, and somewhat surprisingly, I also found that some devices reject
normal (non-fragmented) plaintext frames but do accept fragmented plaintext frames (CVE-2020-26143).

### [Why do you use the same CVE for implementation issues in multiple different codebases?](#samecves)

Implementation-specific vulnerabilities usually get their own independent CVE identifier for each different codebase.
However, because the same implementation issues seem to be present across multiple vendors it would make more sense to have a single CVE identifier
for each common implementation issue.
After all, the main purpose of CVE identifiers is to provide a single, common ID to be used across vendors to identify the same vulnerability.
We therefore think it makes sense to assign only a single CVE identifier to each implementation issues. This enables vendors
and customers to easily reference an implementation vulnerability and, for instance, check whether certain products are affected
by one of the discovered vulnerabilities.

### [Why was the embargo so long?](#longembargo)

The disclosure was delayed by two months in consensus with ICASI and the Wi-Fi Alliance. The decision on whether to disclose fast,
or to provide more time to write and create patches, wasn't easy. At the time, the risk of leaks appeared low,
and the advantage of delaying appeared high. Additionally, we were prepared to immediately disclose in case
details would accidently leak publicly. Another aspect that influenced my decision was *the current situation*, meaning COVID-19,
which among other things made it harder to safely get access to physical places/labs to test patches.

### [How did you monitor for leaks during the embargo?](#detectleaks)

During the last two months of the embargo, we were prepared to make the research public whenever information would seemed to
be leaking. To detect leaks I personally searched for relevant keywords (CVE numbers, paper title, script names) on Google and
social media such as Twitter. The Wi-Fi Alliance and ICASI were also monitoring for leaks (e.g. if questions
came from people that shouldn't have known about it). This can detect innocent leaks. Detecting malicious leaks or
usage of the vulnerabilities in stealthy attacks is a much harder problem (if even possible at all).

If you know about cases where some information was (accidently) leaked, it would be useful to know about that so
that I can better estimate the impact of having long embargos. Any information you provide about this will remain
confidential. This information will help me in future decision when weighing the option of a longer embargo versus
disclosing research even when several vendors don't have patches ready (i.e. it won't be used to point fingers).

### [Are these vulnerabilities being exploited in practice?](#beingexploit)

Not that we are aware of. Because some of the design flaws took so long to discover my hunch is that those have
not been previously exploited in the wild. But it is difficult to monitor whether one of the discovered vulnerabilities have
been exploited in the past or are currently being exploited. So it is hard to give a definite answer to this
question.

### [Why did Microsoft already fix certain vulnerabilities on March 9, 2021?](#microsoft)

The original disclosure date was March 9, 2021. Roughly one week beforehand it was decided to [delay the disclosure](#longembargo).
At this time Microsoft had already committed to shipping certain patches on March 9. I agreed that already releasing
certain patches without providing information about the vulnerabilities was, at that point, an acceptable risk.
Put differently, the advantages of delaying the disclosure appeared to outweigh the risk that someone would reverse engineer
the patches and rediscover certain attacks.

### [Is the "Treating fragments as full frames" flaw (CVE-2020-26142) also applicable to APs?](#apfragasfull)

Yes, access points can also be vulnerable. In particular, during additional experiments that I recently performed, the vulnerability was
also present in OpenBSD when it acted as an access point.

### [Can APs be vulnerable to attacks that send broadcast frames?](#aprecievebcast)

Yes, although they are less likely to be vulnerable compared to clients. This is because under normal circumstances clients
never send a frame to the AP with a broadcast receiver address. Instead, clients first send broadcast/multicast network packets
as unicast Wi-Fi frames to the AP, and the AP then broadcasts these packets to all connected clients. As a result, many APs
will simply ignore Wi-Fi frames with a broadcast receiver address, because in normal networks those frames are only meant for clients.

### [Why are some of the tested devices so old?](#whyold)

I also tested some very old Wi-Fi devices and dongles to estimate how long the discovered vulnerabilities have been
present in the wild. Note that some old devices may remain in use for a long time, for example, expensive medical
or industrial equipment that is rarely replaced.

### [How did you make macOS switch to the malicious DNS server in the demonstration?](#forcebaddns)

After injecting the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement with the malicious DNS server, macOS won't immediately use this DNS server.
This is because macOS will only switch to the malicious DNS server if its current (primary) DNS server is no longer responding.
To force this to happen, we briefly block all traffic towards the victim. This causes macOS to switch to the malicious DNS server.

### [Isn't nyu.edu using HSTS to prevent these kind of attacks?](#nyuhsts)

Websites can use [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to force browsers to always
use HTTPS encryption when visiting a website. This prevents the attack that was shown in our [demo](#href).
Unfortunately, the website of NYU at the time did not properly configure HSTS. More technically, some subdomains such as
globalhome.nyu.edu do instruct the browser to use HSTS by including the following header in responses:

```
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains
```

Unfortunately, other subdomains such as shibboleth.nyu.edu remove HSTS by including the following header in responses:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=0
```

Combined with other configuration decisions, this meant that when a user would type nyu.edu in their browser,
the initial request was sent in plaintext and therefore could be intercepted by an adversary.

Note that NYU has been informed of this issue and is investigating it.

### [How do I reproduce the BlueKeep attack shown in the demonstration?](#bluekeep)

First, when using the NAT punching technique, it is essential that you manually configure the CPORT parameter so that metasploit uses
the correct client port. You can learn this port from the injected TCP SYN packet that arrives at the server. When using a different client port
the router/NAT will not recognize the connection and will not forward it to the victim machine.

Second, you must set the AutoCheck parameter to zero. Otherwise metasploit will try to initiate multiple connections with the
victim and that is problematic when manually specifying a client port through CPORT. This workaround of setting AutoCheck
to zero can be avoided by punching multiple holes in the router/NAT and modifying the metasploit to use a different CPORT for
each connection that will be initiated.
