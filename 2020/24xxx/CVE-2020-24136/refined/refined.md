Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of user-controlled input (`$_POST['pagename']`) to construct a file path that is then used in `file_get_contents()`.  Specifically:

1.  The `pagename` is taken from user-supplied `$_POST['pagename']` and stored in a session variable.
2.  The session variable is then assigned to a global variable `$GLOBALS['pagename']`.
3.  This global variable is then directly used as a file path in `file_get_contents()` within `wcms/wex/html.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The core issue is a path traversal vulnerability. By manipulating the `pagename` parameter with sequences like `../` or absolute paths, an attacker can read files outside of the intended web root directory.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There is no sanitization or validation of the `pagename` parameter before it is used in `file_get_contents()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the web server process has permissions to access, including configuration files, source code, and sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  This allows attackers to gain sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker would need to send an HTTP POST request with a crafted `pagename` parameter.
*   **Web Browser/Client:** The attacker can use a web browser or a tool like curl to send the crafted POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `pagename` parameter and how it's used.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by crafting a `pagename` variable containing `/etc/passwd` which results in outputting the content of that file.
