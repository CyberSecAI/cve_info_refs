This prevents the load of files via absolute paths or path traversal. Ticket is [here](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/UIFR-215).

[@ibacher](https://github.com/ibacher) and [@mogoodrich](https://github.com/mogoodrich) perhaps still a security risk to allow access to application data directory, as this is typically where the openmrs-runtime.properties are located. Could this result in exposing sensitive data there?

I think these changes should be fine for the FileResourceProvider, which was very recently added and I believe the only use case for it is to load resources from the .OpenMRS/configuration directory. Thanks for fixing this security hole that we opened up.

This is still bypassable. if the "path" is user controlled they could enter something like ../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd or similar which even when appended to the application directory will result in a bypass. You will want to do a getcanonicalpath on the path before appending the app directory.

[@golfhackerdave](https://github.com/golfhackerdave) The changes to this file aren't intended to resolve that issue, merely to remove the additional support for absolute paths. The actual fix is in the code for the ResourceFactory. This is because this class isn't used directly to load code, but indirectly via a call to the ResourceFactory.

I understand this fix here and am supportive of it, but can you confirm that it does not prevent behaviors that are currently relied upon from working? The main thing I am thinking of is "development mode" which allows for hot reloading of pages within UI framework when "watching" certain modules. Does this affect that? [@mogoodrich](https://github.com/mogoodrich) do you know?

No sure [@mseaton](https://github.com/mseaton) [@ibacher](https://github.com/ibacher) we'd have to do some testing (and make sure this doesn't break anything else)

So I'm reasonably sure this doesn't break live reloading in development mode. Development mode seems to be support not by providing absolute paths at the point where the resource is requested so much as by scanning a fixed set of development directories in the ModuleResourceProvider class. As long as the paths provided are relative paths (which they should be) that don't involve any directory traversal, things should be fine. So things like: `htmlforms:scripts/mygreatscript.js` will still load.

I'm hoping that the need to request a resource by an absolute path is... non-existent, but we'll have to see.

Yeah, I think we can go with the assumption that the need to request by absolute path is non-existent and not allowed...

### @ibacher **[ibacher](/ibacher)** commented [May 10, 2020](#issue-615290399)

## Description of what I changed

This prevents the load of files via absolute paths or path traversal.

## Issue I worked on

see <https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/HTML-730>

## Checklist: I completed these to help reviewers :)

* My pull request only contains **ONE single commit**

  (the number above, next to the 'Commits' tab is 1).

  No? -> [read here](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Pull%2BRequest%2BTips) on how to squash multiple commits into one
* My IDE is configured to follow the [**code style**](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Java%2BConventions) of this project.

  No? Unsure? -> [configure your IDE](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/How-To%2BSetup%2BAnd%2BUse%2BYour%2BIDE), format the code and add the changes with `git add . && git commit --amend`
* x ] I have **added tests** to cover my changes. (If you refactored

  existing code that was well tested you do not have to add tests)

  No? -> write tests and add them to this commit `git add . && git commit --amend`
* I ran `mvn clean package` right before creating this pull request and

  added all formatting changes to my commit.

  No? -> execute above command
* All new and existing **tests passed**.

  No? -> figure out why and add the fix to your commit. It is your responsibility to make sure your code works.
* My pull request is **based on the latest changes** of the master branch.

  No? Unsure? -> execute command `git pull --rebase upstream master`

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[ibacher](/ibacher)** commented [Jun 2, 2020](#issuecomment-637715470)

| [@sherrif10](https://github.com/sherrif10) It's actually caused by the repository configuration in Travis and the fact that I'm developing this on a branch of the HTMLFormEntry module, so one of those Travis builds kicks off because I updated the branch and the other because I updated the PR. |

![Authenticated Remote Code Execution in OpenMRS](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hubfs/blog_MRS_92120-2.jpg)

Early in May of 2020, Contrast Labs was exploring different ways in which we could help the community or world combat the increase in attacks against medical and testing facilities. We decided quickly that doing some form of hack-a-thon on [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) (an open medical records system) would help us learn but at the same time help OpenMRS find any [application vulnerabilities](/knowledge-hub/glossary/application-vulnerability?hsLang=en) they could fix to increase their security posture.

##### **Chaining Path Traversal Vulnerability**

We spent a day looking through code and examining the application. One of the issues Contrast Labs reported involved chaining path traversal in the htmlformentry-3.10.0 module (OpenMRS has many different modules that can be added to the system) with unvalidated upload of a server-side template to achieve remote code execution. The application vulnerability requires authentication; however, it does not require admin access.

Considering OpenMRS is written in Java, we decided to first instrument the application with [Contrast Assess](/cs/c/?cta_guid=c60d4fbe-7238-4a1f-ba3a-cea57ee47ee6&placement_guid=ef15a5cb-5201-43f4-b388-e19bf5416aeb&portal_id=203759&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contrastsecurity.com%2Fresources%2Fproduct-info&redirect_url=APefjpHfdLR3GlIVVLvUkyTHau4myitOZk15nOOLYfk-nT0axJgL7zjAA_WEi2MAIH02WZkQcB1ezU5qvvZiDjrl9XG2kLM3wfFoeWZ6aOrBvMqvqvRwan4Vi-oHqdNoEJ8r4FB4_afy6Csp47VY9n7ilOgDvGstbKx-N3_7ECB_NDshW0PhF7zdZR6GtxB1rUkb7gM19VcLWv45z2egMlWdYizRorAASlEzfTq99KEf1zQhnAc-KsdfLAsd7b-OE_Iak0COhsEQMay56sZHteqZ8BQbELppMhuYEydgCp0s31MvW15gOrsVobXO51GFxqKyq8vPib_oZMIBZODhIl1xZCY3fBGHAEWvRDjZGFTjuGEyquI20aQ&click=e97c31de-3185-43d2-92dc-646c62ed70f9&hsutk=aabeeef93b4539737946f159e64ad244&signature=AAH58kH5bSZQv69Qxym1xudC1HJLPx6TDQ&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contrastsecurity.com%2Fknowledge-hub%2Fglossary%2Fapplication-vulnerability%3FhsLang%3Den&pageId=5765883881&__hstc=92971330.aabeeef93b4539737946f159e64ad244.1588880913407.1600297877075.1600357561075.361&__hssc=92971330.5.1600357561075&__hsfp=1089211427&contentType=standard-page) to find vulnerabilities. Once instrumented, we used the OpenMRS application and immediately detected a number of issues. One of the interesting findings was a [path traversal vulnerability](/knowledge-hub/glossary/path-traversal-or-directory-traversal?hsLang=en) in the definitionUiResource parameter of the /htmlformentryui/htmlform/enterHtmlFormWithSimpleUi.page endpoint. The details of the vulnerability can be seen below:

##### OpenMRS-vulnerability

To explain what was seen, Contrast Assess detected user data entered in the definitionUiResource URL query string parameter that was used directly in viewing a new File object. This resulted in the path traversal vulnerability.

![path-traversal-vulnerability](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/path-traversal-vulnerability.png?width=936&name=path-traversal-vulnerability.png)

##### **Reproducing the Path Traversal Vulnerability**

Since Contrast Assess detected that the new File object was being accessed, we thought this could be an avenue to break out into other directories on the system or an opportunity to achieve remote code execution (RCE). Attempting to reproduce the path traversal vulnerability, we entered ../ directory escape characters into the definitionUiResource parameter in the request query string. It resulted in a very detailed error message indicating the application was looking for a file on disk.

![definitionUiResource-vulnerability](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/definitionUiResource-vulnerability.png?width=918&name=definitionUiResource-vulnerability.png)

This was good news. However, what was determined is that this particular endpoint expected that the file retrieved be a specially crafted server-side template. Any other file type resulted in an error, such as including sensitive local files like /etc/passwd (observe the following org.xml.sax.SAXParseException error message).

![SAXParseException-vulnerability](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SAXParseException-vulnerability.png?width=940&name=SAXParseException-vulnerability.png)

This told us that we needed to somehow take advantage of the server-side template by uploading a malicious template file to the system. We researched this further and discovered that OpenMRS implements a custom templating format through its HTML form entry module to render application views for the end-user. We were able to locate [documentation](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/HTML%2BForm%2BEntry%2BModule%2BReference#HTMLFormEntryModuleReference-ExampleUsage.13) for the HTML forms and noticed that particular parsing fields exist that evaluate Velocity template language.

After discovering this, we were able to craft a well-formatted template that included code execution, using the [vitals.xml](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-referenceapplication/blob/master/omod/src/main/webapp/resources/htmlforms/vitals.xml) from the reference application as a starting point. As you can see in the screenshot below, we utilized Velocity template language to execute a direct system command of cat /etc/passwd and in turn return the contents of the “passwd” file. If we could get this to run on the server and view the contents of that file, then we could prove RCE.

![OpenMRS-code-set](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OpenMRS-code-set.png?width=904&name=OpenMRS-code-set.png)

##### **Uploading the File and Locating It**

Now that we have a vulnerable endpoint and malicious template, we need to figure out how to upload the file and locate it on the system. Since OpenMRS is a medical records system, there are multiple places to upload files like medical records and much more. One such location that allows any type of file to be uploaded is when a patient checks in for a visit within the application. When doing so, it is possible to attach files to a patient record in the system, as seen in the screenshot below.

![OpenMRS-patient-view](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/OpenMRS-patient-view.png?width=936&name=OpenMRS-patient-view.png)

Once the malicious template was uploaded into this location, the next step was to determine the name and location of the uploaded file. The resulting filename on the system can be inferred based on a combination of the original upload filename and UIDs included in responses from the application.

![malicious-template](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/malicious-template.png?width=940&name=malicious-template.png)

##### **Reporting the Vulnerability**

As you can see, the original filename was rce\_20200826\_13393.xml and the response included the UUID of 955cf4a9-6b64-435a-b676-546801955e63. In further research, we determined the files were saved in the appdata/complex\_obs directory and that the filename is now rce\_20200826\_13393\_955cf4a9-6b64-435a-b676-546801955e63.xml. Once we reliably correlated an uploaded file to the file location on disk, it was possible to upload our crafted template and then subsequently request the file through the discovered path traversal vulnerability. As you can see below, the exploit request resulted in the contents of the /etc/passwd file being returned to the end-user.

![vulnerability-reporting](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/hs-fs/hubfs/vulnerability-reporting.png?width=936&name=vulnerability-reporting.png)

At this point, we had reached a level of confidence to report the issue to OpenMRS. OpenMRS has a defined process for reporting security issues, which is outlined [here](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Reporting%2BBugs). We submitted the issue, and the timeline below outlines the speedy fix.

* 05-05-2020 Contrast Labs reported the issue to OpenMRS.
* 05-06-2020 OpenMRS responded, acknowledging the vulnerability.
* 06-02-2020 [Code](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-htmlformentry/pull/178) was merged to master to fix the directory traversal.
* 07-24-2020 Updated htmlformentry was added to version 3.11.0 and pushed to the public.
* 08-25-2020 Preliminary CVE issued: CVE-2020-24621

Any systems of OpenMRS that utilize the htmlformentry module should upgrade to version 3.11.0 [here](https://addons.openmrs.org/show/org.openmrs.module.htmlformentry).
