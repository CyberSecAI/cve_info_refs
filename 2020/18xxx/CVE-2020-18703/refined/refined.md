The content is related to CVE-2020-18703.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data (authors, title) when generating XML feeds (RSS and Atom). Specifically, the application does not filter or escape XML entities, allowing an attacker to insert malicious XML payloads into the generated XML documents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection: The core issue is the lack of input validation on XML data. This enables an attacker to inject malicious XML code which can be parsed by the XML processor, leading to XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary XML payloads. This can potentially lead to:
  - Information disclosure by exploiting external entities to read local files on the server.
  - Denial-of-service (DoS) by using external entity expansion.
  - Potential remote code execution in certain scenarios although the content doesn't explicitly say this
- The attacker could insert arbitrary content into the generated XML feeds.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `author` and `title` fields of a created article.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify articles in the system.
- The attacker has to access or trigger the generation of the RSS and Atom feeds via the specific URLs:
  - `http://192.168.100.8:8000/author/{author}/index.rss`
  - `http://192.168.100.8:8000/author/{author}/index.atom`
