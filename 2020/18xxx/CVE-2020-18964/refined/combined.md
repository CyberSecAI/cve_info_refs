### csrf vulnerability

In this vulnerability, if the admin user click the Fishing links the hacker provided, the it can generate a new user that can login in the website management background.

I review the code in the project, then I found that the code where the admin add other users, it has no protection for Cross-site request forgery.

so, I use burp to generate the CSRF Poc.

then, if the admin click the button(some csrf link), it generates a new user admin2 in the websie.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49016976/55530914-a7d31a80-56da-11e9-8461-618442251ed9.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49016976/55530914-a7d31a80-56da-11e9-8461-618442251ed9.png)

admin2 can login in the website background.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49016976/55530923-b28daf80-56da-11e9-9838-919152dabfbe.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49016976/55530923-b28daf80-56da-11e9-9838-919152dabfbe.png)

for more test, this vulnerability can also use to delete some user in the website.
