Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `cashout_id[]`, `menu_id[]`, and `ad_id[]` parameters are directly inserted into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-controlled input strings, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, including user information, financial records, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data loss or application malfunction.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to escalate their privileges and gain control of the database server or the underlying system.
*   **Application Downtime:** Attackers can disrupt the application by injecting malicious SQL code that can cause errors or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to specific admin endpoints, where the vulnerable parameters are part of the request body.
    *   `admin.php?mod=cashout&act=success` with the `cashout_id[]` parameter.
    *   `admin.php?mod=menu&act=del` with the `menu_id[]` parameter.
    *   `admin.php?mod=ad&act=del` with the `ad_id[]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and be able to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the application, implying they are either an authenticated user or have access to the application's network.

**More Details:**

The provided content provides specific Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploits for each SQL injection vulnerability, including:

*   The specific vulnerable URLs.
*   The HTTP request headers (Host, User-Agent, Accept, etc.).
*   The vulnerable POST parameters with SQL injection payloads (e.g., `cashout_id%5B%5D=1')+and+IF(1=1,sleep(2),1)+and+('1'='1`).
*   Verification screenshots showing the successful injection using sleep(2).
*   Code snippets showing the vulnerable code lines in `module/admin/cashout.php`, `module/admin/menu.php`, and `module/admin/ad.php`.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in PHPSHE v1.7.
