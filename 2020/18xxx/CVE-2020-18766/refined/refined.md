The provided content describes a vulnerability in antSword, a web shell management tool.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of error messages displayed by antSword when a connection to a web shell fails. Specifically, the application echoes the error information without any XSS protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize the error messages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the error output, which is then executed by the victim's browser.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Through the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser. This can be further leveraged to achieve RCE on the victim's machine through the injected JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the machine running the antSword client. This is demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept which executes a reverse shell.
- The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information from the victim's machine, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control a web server that is being targeted by the antSword client.
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP response containing XSS payload in the HTTP header, which is returned when antSword fails to connect to the web shell. The attacker leverages the fact that the application displays the server error message to inject the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a web server accessible to the antSword client.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target machine, only the ability to control the web server responding to the antSword connection attempt.
