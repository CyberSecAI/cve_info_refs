The provided content relates to CVE-2020-18125.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `/ndxzsite/plugin/ajax.php` file. The application directly uses user-controlled POST parameters, specifically the `z` parameter, without proper encoding or sanitization when rendering the output, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The lack of input sanitization when handling the `z` parameter allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
- Defacement of the affected web page.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `z` parameter.
- The victim visits the crafted URL, which then sends the POST request containing the payload.
- The vulnerable application directly includes the malicious payload in the response, executing the script in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the crafted payload.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to visit the malicious URL (e.g. through phishing or other means).
- No specific server-side access or privileges are required for successful exploitation.
