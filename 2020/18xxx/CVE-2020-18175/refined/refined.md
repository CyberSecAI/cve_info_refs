Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `get_user_by_emailid` function within `/app/system/include/class/user.class.php`. The function directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$email`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting a malicious email address, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, leading to unauthorized database access or manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials, personal information).
    *   Modify or delete database records.
    *   Potentially gain full control over the database server.
*   **Account Takeover:** The provided example in the exploit section attempts to manipulate user data using username 'tete', which could result in account takeover.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request to `dosafety_emailadd`:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `/member/basic.php?a=dosafety_emailadd` endpoint by manipulating the email address field used in the application, where it is passed into the vulnerable function.
*   **Specifically crafted email parameter:** The email parameter is the vector for injecting the malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target web application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Ability to craft SQL payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to create valid SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Metinfo application knowledge:** The attacker needs to know that Metinfo application is running, and how to get the key needed to encrypt the injected payload.
*   **Valid cookie:** A valid session cookie is needed to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit is dependent on whether the PHP installation is Thread Safe (TS) or Non-Thread Safe (NTS) due to encryption key handling. The exploit code handles both cases via the tamper script.
*   The exploit also provides a `sqli.php` script which implements the necessary decoding for crafting the SQL injection payloads.
*   The example uses a user with the username `tete` for demonstration purposes, which is assumed to already exist in the database.

**In summary,** the provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Metinfo application which is exploitable via a web request with a crafted email address. The vulnerability allows for arbitrary SQL injection, leading to potential data breaches and system compromise.
