Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in GetSimpleCMS, specifically related to CVE-2020-18660:

**Vulnerability 1: Arbitrary URL Redirection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `redirect` function in GetSimpleCMS does not validate the `$url` parameter before redirecting the user.
*   **Weakness:** Unvalidated input leading to arbitrary URL redirection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially for phishing or other attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** By controlling the `$url` parameter passed to the redirect function (e.g., via `$_POST['redirectto']` in `/admin/changedata.php`).
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to submit a crafted HTTP POST request or otherwise control the `$redirect_url` parameter, which is passed to the redirect function.

**Vulnerability 2: Limited Reflective XSS in the `redirect` function**

*   **Root Cause:** When headers have already been sent and the redirect function falls back to javascript redirection, the `$url` parameter is directly embedded into the javascript without proper sanitization.
*  **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization when embedding user-controlled input into a JavaScript string context.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary javascript within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** By controlling the `$url` parameter passed to the `redirect` function, when `headers_sent()` returns True.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to control the `$redirect_url` parameter and trigger the condition that `headers_sent()` returns True.

**Vulnerability 3: Reflective XSS in `/admin/settings.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$TIMEZONE` parameter is taken from `$_POST` data and used in the page output without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization when embedding user-controlled input into a web page.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary javascript within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/admin/settings.php` with a malicious value for the `TIMEZONE` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted POST request to `/admin/settings.php` and be logged into the admin panel.

**Vulnerability 4: Reflective XSS in `/admin/setup.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `sitename`, `username`, and `email` parameters are returned to the page without sanitization if an error occurs during setup.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization when embedding user-controlled input into a web page.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary javascript within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:** By submitting crafted data during the setup process and causing an error, which reflects the parameters back to the page.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the setup process and input values that will cause an error.
