Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-18774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error within the `Exiv2::Internal::printLong` function in `tags_int.cpp`. This occurs when the divisor (`r.second`) is zero during a division operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Division by Zero:** The code lacks proper validation to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division operation. This can cause a program crash if the divisor is indeed zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  The division by zero leads to a floating-point exception (SIGFPE), causing the `exiv2` program to crash. This can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition by crafting a malicious input.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input to the `exiv2` tool. Specifically, the input file, `fpe_poc.zip` in this instance, contains data that results in a zero value for the divisor.
- The `exiv2` command line tool is used to process the malicious image using the `-pt` option which then triggers the code leading to the division by zero

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable `exiv2` program with a crafted input file (e.g., a malformed image file) designed to trigger the division-by-zero vulnerability.
- The attacker is likely a local user, however, if this tool is used to process arbitrary files through some API then remote exploitation might be possible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The GitHub issue #759 provides a detailed stack trace of the program crash, which is helpful for understanding the call chain and identifying the precise location of the vulnerability.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions that this CVE is one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting Exiv2 and that users should update to version 0.28.1 or higher, as well as the severity being "high" and exploitable both locally and remotely.
- The github issue is marked as not reproducible.
