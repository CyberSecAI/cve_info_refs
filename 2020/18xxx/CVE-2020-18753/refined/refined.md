- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DCCE MAC1100 PLC uses the EPA protocol on port 11000 for communication. It lacks proper authorization mechanisms, allowing attackers to control the PLC by sending specifically crafted network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of authorization/authentication, reliance on insecure protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remotely control the PLC, including starting and stopping the PLC's CPU. This could disrupt the normal operation of the industrial processes controlled by the PLC.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted UDP packets via the network to port 11000.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the PLC and the ability to send UDP packets.
