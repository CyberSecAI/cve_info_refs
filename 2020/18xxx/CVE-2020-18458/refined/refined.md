  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions on the application, such as changing configuration settings. In this specific case, the attacker is able to modify the site settings.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page or a script that will send a forged request to the application. When a logged-in administrator visits this malicious page, the browser will automatically send the request to the application, leveraging the administrator's active session.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage, or opening an email containing malicious content. The attacker must also have some prior knowledge of the application's functionality to be able to craft the malicious request. The application is also required to have an active administrator logged-in."
