The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Laobancms, including a file upload vulnerability and two XSS vulnerabilities. However, it does not specify a CVE-2020-18165. 

Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**File Upload Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate file extension validation in `laobancms/admin/wenjian.php`. The code uses `strstr()` to check for allowed extensions but fails to prevent the upload of files with double extensions (e.g., `test.jpg.php`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input validation
    *   Use of a weak file extension check
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution by uploading and executing a PHP file.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attacker uploads a file with a double extension (e.g., `test.jpg.php`) to the server using `admin/wenjian.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must be logged in to the admin page. The document mentions that this requires setting a cookie (`id=1`), referencing CVE-2018-19224 which allows bypassing authentication. This is a prerequisite for this vulnerability.
    *   Attacker can navigate to `admin/wenjian.php` with `wj` parameter set to the desired upload directory (e.g. `../templets/pc`).

**XSS Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input in "网站SEO关键词" form at `admin/info.php?shuyu=基础设置` which allows injection of javascript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Lack of input sanitization
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code in the "网站SEO关键词" form, saves the changes, updates the website using the admin panel's "更新今日" button, and the XSS is triggered when a user visits the website.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must be logged in to the admin page (Requires CVE-2018-19224 to set the cookie `id=1`)
    *   Attacker has access to the `admin/info.php?shuyu=基础设置` page

**XSS Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user input in "首页简介" form at `admin/info.php?shuyu=我的参数` which allows injection of javascript code.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Lack of input sanitization
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code in the "首页简介" form, saves the changes, updates the website using the admin panel's "更新今日" button, and the XSS is triggered when a user visits the website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *    Attacker must be logged in to the admin page (Requires CVE-2018-19224 to set the cookie `id=1`)
    *    Attacker has access to the `admin/info.php?shuyu=我的参数` page

**Additional Note:** The document mentions the dependency on `CVE-2018-19224`, for accessing the admin panel, which is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability, this is required for the successful exploitation of file upload vulnerability and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Summary**

The provided document describes a file upload vulnerability and two XSS vulnerabilities in Laobancms. These vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially compromise user sessions. The identified vulnerabilities and their prerequisites provide details beyond the standard CVE description.

However, the content **does not relate** to CVE-2020-18165.
