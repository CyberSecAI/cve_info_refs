- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file extension validation in the `poster_edit.php` file within the AIKCMS v2.0.0 administration panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to missing file extension checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, to the server. This allows for arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise (getshelled).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the file upload functionality within the admin panel of AIKCMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have valid administrative access to the AIKCMS.
    - The attacker needs to navigate to the 'poster' edit section.
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious file, disguised by manipulating the filename and its extension during the upload process to circumvent any basic checks that might be in place.
