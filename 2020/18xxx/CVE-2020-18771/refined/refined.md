Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-18771:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer over-read in the function `Exiv2::Internal::Nikon1MakerNote::print0x0088` located in `nikonmn_int.cpp`. This function is responsible for printing specific metadata from Nikon image files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer over-read: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer. This indicates a lack of proper bounds checking during data access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information leak: The primary impact is an information leak, as the over-read could expose data from adjacent memory locations.
- Denial of Service (DoS): While the primary impact is information leak, a crash due to out-of-bounds access is also mentioned which implies potential DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted image file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted image file containing malicious Nikon MakerNote metadata.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when printing the metadata.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious image file and trick a user or system into processing it using the vulnerable version of Exiv2.

**Additional Details:**
- The github content provides a proof-of-concept (POC) zip file, `poc.zip`, which triggers the vulnerability.
- The address sanitizer output shows the exact location of the buffer over-read and the nearby global variables involved.
- The issue was reported on March 25, 2019, and a fix was later implemented in a subsequent version of exiv2.
- The Debian LTS advisory also mentions this vulnerability.
