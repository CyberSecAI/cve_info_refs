Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the theme edit function within `/PluXml/core/admin/parametres_edittpl.php`. This function allows users to modify template files, and it doesn't prevent the insertion of arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary PHP code into template files. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this by inserting PHP code within a template file using a POST request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by crafting malicious template content. In the PoC, the attacker uses `assert($_REQUEST['c'])`, which allows them to execute any PHP command by passing a 'c' parameter in the URL. This can lead to full compromise of the web server, including data theft, defacement, and malware installation.
*   **Full System Control:** By executing arbitrary PHP, the attacker gains the ability to interact with the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/PluXml/core/admin/parametres_edittpl.php`. The request contains the template name (`template`), a token, a submit action, and the malicious PHP code in the `content` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have sufficient privileges to access the theme edit function, which is part of the PluXml's admin interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The provided PoC clearly demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability. It includes the malicious POST request and how to subsequently trigger the execution of injected PHP code by visiting the modified template file with a malicious parameter.
*   The vulnerability was reported in February 2019.

In summary, the content provides information that aligns with the vulnerability description for CVE-2020-18184 which involves an arbitrary file upload/RCE vulnerability due to lack of sanitization when editing template files within the PluXml CMS.
