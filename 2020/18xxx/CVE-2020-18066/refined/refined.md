The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the zrlog blogging platform.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the comment submission form. User-supplied data, specifically the `userName` and `email` fields, are not properly filtered or encoded before being stored and rendered in the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected through the comment form and stored in the database. When this data is retrieved and displayed (e.g., when viewing a post's comments or when an admin views comments in the admin panel), the malicious code is executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Cookie theft:** The attacker can execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser, allowing them to steal the victim's session cookies.
- **Privilege escalation:** If an administrator's session cookie is stolen, the attacker can gain access to the admin panel and perform administrative actions, potentially compromising the entire website.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript through the comment form, specifically using the `userName` and `email` fields. The provided payload is: `"> <img src=i onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
- The XSS payload gets stored in the database.
- When the comment section of the blog post is viewed, or when an admin reviews comments in the backend, the stored JavaScript payload is executed in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to submit comments on the affected blog.
- No special privileges are required to perform the attack.
