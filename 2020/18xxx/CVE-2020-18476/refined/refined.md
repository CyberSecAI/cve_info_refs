- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation of the `usd_image` field within the user profile update functionality in Hucart CMS v5.7.4.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `usd_image` field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface by submitting a crafted POST request to `/user/index.php?load=user_info&act=update_user`. The malicious SQL payload is embedded within the `usd_image` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Hucart CMS to access the user profile update functionality.
