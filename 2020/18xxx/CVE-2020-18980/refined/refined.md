- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cloneFromRemote` function in the Halo application constructs a command string using user-supplied `remoteAddr` and `themeName` parameters and executes it via `RuntimeUtil.execForStr`. The application does not sanitize or validate these parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the command string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Command injection: The application is vulnerable to command injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before passing it to a system shell command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `/admin/themes/clone` endpoint, which accepts POST requests with `remoteAddr` and `themeName` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/admin/themes/clone`.
    - The attacker must know the parameter names to inject their malicious code.
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application, as this endpoint is under `/admin` path.
