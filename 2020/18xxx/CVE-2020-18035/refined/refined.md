The provided content is related to CVE-2020-18035.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `CKEditorFuncNum` parameter in `CkeditorUploadController.java`. The value of this parameter is directly outputted into the HTML context, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input.
- Insufficient filtering in the XSS interceptor which only filters `<script>` tags, but not other XSS vectors.
- Vulnerable code location is `CkeditorUploadController.java` at line 41.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- The attacker can potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal cookies, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- Although this is a POST-based reflected XSS vulnerability, it could be combined with CSRF attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request with a malicious value for the `CKEditorFuncNum` parameter.
- The specific injection point is within the output context: `CKEditorFuncNum="<malicious_payload>";`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application, either directly or by tricking a user into submitting a malicious form (via CSRF).
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious payload suitable to the injection point.
