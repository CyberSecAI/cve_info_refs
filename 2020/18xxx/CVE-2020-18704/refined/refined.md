The provided content describes an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the demo site of the django-widgy project.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The image widget in the demo site allows users to upload any file without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including potentially executable files, to the server. This could lead to remote code execution if the attacker can then access and execute the uploaded file (as demonstrated). The uploaded file can be accessed by anyone who has the URL of the uploaded file, which can lead to code execution and potentially other types of attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the image widget in the demo site's page builder which allows a user to upload files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to access the page builder on the demo site and have the ability to upload a file through the image widget.
