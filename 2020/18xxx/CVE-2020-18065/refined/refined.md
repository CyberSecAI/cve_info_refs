{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing menus, specifically the 'title' field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, stored XSS.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the menu title. This code can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the menu management page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be logged in to the PopojiCMS admin panel and have the ability to edit menus. They then inject the malicious javascript code through the `title` parameter within POST request to the `/PopojiCMS-master/po-admin/route.php?mod=menumanager&act=savemenu` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrative access to the PopojiCMS instance, specifically the permission to edit menus. They must also be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
