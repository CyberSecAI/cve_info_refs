The provided content contains details of three vulnerabilities in gnuboard5 before version 5.3.2.8, which are:

1.  **Limited Reflective XSS in `bbs/login.php`**:
    *   **Root cause:** The `$url` parameter in `bbs/login.php` is not properly sanitized. While single and double quotes are filtered, the function `check_url_host` treats URLs without `http` or `https` as a path without further filtering. The `goto_url` function directly splices the URL into JavaScript when headers have already been sent, leading to XSS.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Reflective XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious URL with a payload like `www.baidu.com</script><script>alert(1)</script>`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can induce a victim to visit a crafted URL.

2.  **Reflective XSS in `bbs/move_update.php`**:
    *   **Root cause:** The `$act` parameter in `bbs/move_update.php` is not properly sanitized. Similar to the previous vulnerability, while single and double quotes are filtered, the attacker can inject a payload by escaping the context using `<script>` tags.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Reflective XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious request with a payload like `act=12<%2fscript><script>alert(1)<%2fscript>`.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can induce a victim to submit a crafted request.

3.  **SQL Injection in `install_db.php`**:
    *   **Root cause:** The `$table_prefix` parameter in `install_db.php` is filtered by `safe_install_string_check`, which only checks for a list of "evil keywords" rather than performing a complete sanitization, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    *  **Attack Vector**: By injecting a payload into the `table_prefix` parameter, the attacker can close the current query using backticks, inject new SQL statements and potentially gain control of the database.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker can submit a POST request to `install_db.php` with a crafted payload in the `table_prefix` parameter. Example payload:  `mysql_host=localhost&mysql_user=root&mysql_pass=&mysql_db=g5&table_prefix=123\`; select sleep(5)#`.
