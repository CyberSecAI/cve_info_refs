The provided content describes a stack exhaustion vulnerability in the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function within the `image.cpp` file of the Exiv2 library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled recursion within the `Exiv2::Image::printIFDStructure` function. The function calls itself recursively, leading to stack exhaustion when processing crafted image files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Recursion: The function does not have proper checks or mechanisms to prevent infinite or excessive recursive calls when processing specific input data. This leads to excessive memory allocation on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack exhaustion: When the recursive function calls exceed the available stack memory, it results in a stack overflow, causing the application to crash and leading to denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted image files: An attacker can create an image file with specific characteristics that trigger the recursive calls within `printIFDStructure`, leading to the stack overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a maliciously crafted image file to the vulnerable application using Exiv2 library. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
