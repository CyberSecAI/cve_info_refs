The provided content is related to CVE-2020-18467.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization when creating tags in BigTree CMS version 4.4.3, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization of tag names during creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject arbitrary code into the application.
- When an administrator accesses the "Tags" section, the injected malicious script is executed.
- This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or the execution of arbitrary commands within the administrator's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/admin/tags/create/` endpoint.
- The POST request includes a malicious payload within the `tag` parameter, which is not properly sanitized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the BigTree CMS instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability but the vulnerability is only triggered after an administrator accesses the tags section.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable endpoint.
