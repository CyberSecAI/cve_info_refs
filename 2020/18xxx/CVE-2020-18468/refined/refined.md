The content is related to CVE-2020-18468.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not recursively strip `<script>` tags. It attempts to sanitize input by stripping `<script>` and `</script>` tags, but this sanitization is not recursive and can be bypassed by crafting a payload that includes nested tags such as `"><script>pt>alert(1111)</script>//`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate input sanitization. Specifically, the application's attempt to strip `<script>` tags is not recursive.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via an authenticated POST HTTP request to `/qdPM_9.1/index.php/configuration`, targeting the "Heading" field in the "Login Page" settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires an authenticated administrator account to access the application's configuration settings.
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted POST request to modify the "Heading" field.
