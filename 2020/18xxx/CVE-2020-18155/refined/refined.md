The provided content discusses a time-based SQL injection vulnerability in Subrion CMS when using PDO for database connections. This aligns with the description of CVE-2020-18155 which is described as a "time-based SQL injection vulnerability."

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of PDO for database connections within Subrion CMS. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user input when using PDO, allowing for direct SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application is vulnerable to time-based SQL injection, meaning an attacker can use SQL `SLEEP()` function to cause delays in database query execution, confirming the injection and potentially extracting data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: the attacker could read sensitive data from the database.
    *   Data modification: the attacker could alter or delete data.
    *   Potential full compromise of the database and underlying system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is the search functionality of the Subrion CMS. The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious query string in the `q` parameter of the search URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Subrion CMS instance, specifically targeting the search functionality. No prior authentication is required for exploitation. They must also know the site is using a PDO database connection.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, including the specific attack vector (search functionality) and how the exploitation can be tested via the `SLEEP()` function.
