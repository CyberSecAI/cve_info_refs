Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the file upload functionality of PHPMyWind version 5.6, specifically within the `admin/upload_file_do.php` script and related code in `data/httpfile/upload.class.php`.
- The core issue is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the uploaded filename.
- The system does not check the actual filename before uploading, allowing an attacker to bypass extension checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure File Upload:** The system allows arbitrary file uploads without properly validating the file type based on its extension and content.
- **Extension Bypass:** The system can be tricked into accepting PHP files by adding a space after the `.php` extension (e.g., `info.php `) due to Windows automatically removing trailing spaces.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code in `data/httpfile/upload.class.php` does not validate the filename before saving it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which, when accessed, will execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or further attacks.
- **Shell Access (Getshell):** As the issue title suggests, exploitation can lead to obtaining a shell on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Upload:** The attack is carried out via the file upload functionality within the administrative panel of PHPMyWind.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have administrative credentials to access the vulnerable file upload functionality.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the extension bypass method using trailing spaces.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by adding `php ` to the allowed upload extensions and uploading a file like `info.php `.
- The space at the end of the extension is removed by the Windows OS when the file is saved on disk, thus bypassing the extension check.
- The `data/httpfile/upload.class.php` file does not properly sanitize or validate the input filename.

**Mitigation:**
- The issue report suggests using `trim(filename)` to remove leading and trailing spaces from filenames.

This vulnerability allows a malicious user with administrative access to achieve remote code execution by uploading a php file and accessing it directly.
