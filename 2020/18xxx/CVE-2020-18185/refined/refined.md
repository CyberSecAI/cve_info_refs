The provided content describes a vulnerability in PluXml, specifically within the `class.plx.admin.php` file. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `config_path` parameter within the `class.plx.admin.php` file. The code attempts to relocate the configuration directory, and the user supplied `config_path` is used to write to the `config.php` file without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By injecting malicious PHP code into the `config_path` parameter, an attacker can write it to the `config.php` file.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user input for the `config_path` parameter, which allows for injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This can lead to:
  - Webshell access
  - Data theft
  - Modification or deletion of files.
  - Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via an HTTP POST request to the `/PluXml/core/admin/parametres_affichage.php` endpoint.
- The `config_path` parameter within the POST data is used as the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface to be able to access the `parametres_affichage.php` page.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the server.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned, but it is implied that this is an administrator page.
