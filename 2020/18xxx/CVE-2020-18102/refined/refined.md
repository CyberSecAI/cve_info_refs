The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `/view/hotelList.php` file of the `Hotels_Server` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input sanitization/filtration in `/view/hotelList.php` when echoing data from the database and also when inserting data in `/controller/publishHotel.php` prior to storing it in the database. User-supplied data is directly outputted to the HTML without any encoding or filtering, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application is vulnerable to XSS due to unsanitized user-controlled data being reflected in the page output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected page.
- **Session hijacking:** Exploitation could lead to session hijacking, where an attacker gains control of a user's session and account.
- **Data theft:** The attacker could steal sensitive information, like cookies, authentication tokens, or other personal data.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the affected web page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields related to hotel information. This malicious code is then stored in the database.
- **Reflected XSS:** When users view the hotel list on `/view/hotelList.php`, the stored malicious code is retrieved from the database and directly echoed into the HTML page, causing the malicious script to be executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to add hotel information:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the `/controller/publishHotel.php` to inject the malicious payload and store it in the database. This might be through a public-facing form or API endpoint that adds data to the database.
- **Access to the vulnerable page:** The attacker does not directly interact with the `/view/hotelList.php` page but needs another user to access it to have the malicious script triggered.
