{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `asynclist_list` function of the `ExchangeController` within the Ectouch CMS. The `integral_min` parameter obtained from the URL is passed directly to a database query via the `exchange_get_goods` function without proper filtering or sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the direct incorporation of user-supplied input into an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization: The input is only filtered using `htmlspecialchars`, which does not prevent SQL injection. It converts special HTML characters but doesn't sanitize against SQL injection."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to bypass authentication mechanisms, read sensitive data like usernames and password hashes, modify or delete data, potentially gain full access to the system's database, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `asynclist_list` endpoint.  The `integral_min` parameter is used to inject the SQL code. The parameter is accessed through a vulnerable controller function. An attacker can send a crafted URL to exploit this vulnerability."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Ectouch CMS application. No authentication or special privileges are required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists due to the `I` function not properly sanitizing the `integral_min` parameter. The `DEFAULT_FILTER` which is set to `htmlspecialchars` is ineffective against SQL injection. The attacker needs to URL encode the SQL payload to bypass the filtering process. The payload must have a space before 'union' . The web server might need to have the `.htaccess` file temporarily modified or deleted for the request to work using a computer-side browser. The attack is still effective on mobile using Burp Suite to intercept requests without having to modify the `.htaccess` file."
