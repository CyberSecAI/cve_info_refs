{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MAC1100 PLC communicates on port 11000 using the EPA protocol. The vulnerability stems from the way the EPA protocol handles variable identification, allowing access to any memory area.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory arbitrary read vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read the contents of any variable area of the PLC's memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted EPA protocol packets to the PLC on port 11000.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the PLC on port 11000. The attacker needs to know the IP of the PLC, in this case the PoC code shows 192.168.1.181."
