The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in UKCMS v1.1.10.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization or filtering of data in the `index()` function within the `application/home/controller/Single.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the message board through the guestbook feature. When an administrator views the guestbook messages in the admin panel, the malicious script executes in their browser.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious actions including session hijacking, account compromise or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the guestbook feature on the front page.
- The injected script executes when an administrator views the message board in the admin panel at `admin.php/admin/content/guestbook.html`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post content to the guestbook.
- The attacker also needs to know that administrator uses `admin.php/admin/content/guestbook.html` to view the content.
