The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in FeiFeiCMS 4.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper CSRF protection in the admin user creation functionality of FeiFeiCMS 4.1. Specifically, the application does not include a token or other mechanism to prevent an attacker from crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated administrator, will add a new admin user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection in the `/index.php?s=Admin-Admin-Insert` endpoint, which is responsible for adding new admin users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Admin User Creation:** A successful attack allows an attacker to create a new admin user with credentials of their choosing (in this case, username "hacker" and password "hacker"). This enables the attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML Form:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML form that, when accessed by an authenticated administrator, will submit a request to add the attacker's desired admin user via the vulnerable endpoint `/index.php?s=Admin-Admin-Insert`. This form can be embedded within a malicious website, an email, or other attacker-controlled context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Target User Logged In:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a page containing the malicious HTML form.
*   **No Direct Access Required:** The attacker does not require direct access to the FeiFeiCMS server, just a means to get the administrator to interact with the malicious payload.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the exact endpoint and parameters to exploit the vulnerability. The provided PoC demonstrates knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `http://www.test.com/index.php?s=Admin-Admin-Insert` and the required form fields.
