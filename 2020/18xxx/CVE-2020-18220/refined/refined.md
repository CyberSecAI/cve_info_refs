```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a static key (`doracms_`) for AES encryption and a static key (`dora`) for MD5 operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded cryptographic keys for encryption.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can more easily conduct brute-force password guessing due to the use of static encryption keys.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by gaining access to the encrypted data and then using the static key to decrypt or crack the passwords.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs access to the encrypted data or be able to intercept the encryption process."
