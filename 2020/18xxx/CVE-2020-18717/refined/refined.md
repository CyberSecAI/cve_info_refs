Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `inc/zzz_template.php` file of ZZZPHP.
- The `searchcol` parameter, taken from the POST form, is not properly sanitized and is directly used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.
- The application retrieves parameter keys from cookies, which are also not filtered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization for parameters retrieved from POST and cookies.
- Usage of unfiltered values in SQL queries.
- Numeric injection is present since quotation escaping is not enforced.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can potentially lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the front-end of the application.
- Attackers can exploit this through crafted POST requests and manipulated cookies.
- The `searchcol` parameter in the POST request and parameter keys from the cookie can be injected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate their cookies.
- No authentication or special access seems to be required to trigger this vulnerability since it's in the front end.

**Additional details:**
- The `searchcol` parameter is explicitly mentioned as being vulnerable to numeric injection.
- The use of `sqlmap` is mentioned for verification.
- The affected version is below 1.7.1.
- The vulnerability was submitted to SeeBug on 2019-07-26.
