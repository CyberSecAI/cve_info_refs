The provided content relates to CVE-2020-18457.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in version 1.3.0 of the bycms CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user. This particular instance changes the module id of the user account.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML page that contains a crafted HTTP request targeting a vulnerable endpoint (http://localhost/admin.php/ucenter/index/module_id/78.html) with a user-specified module id. This page is then delivered to a logged-in user of the affected system. Once the user visits the page, the malicious request is automatically executed by their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file and trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable application into visiting it. The attacker does not need to have direct access to the application or the victim's computer. The attacker must also know the vulnerable endpoint to target.
