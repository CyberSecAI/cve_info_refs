The provided content describes two stored XSS vulnerabilities in Rukovoditel 2.4.1.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the "Name of application" field during the application's installation process. The application attempts to strip `<script>` tags, but does so non-recursively.
*   **Weakness:** Non-recursive filtering of `<script>` tags allows for bypass using crafted payloads such as `"><script>pt>alert(1)</script>//`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when an unauthenticated user visits the application, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vector:** Authenticated POST HTTP request to `rukovoditel_2.4.1/install/index.php` with a crafted payload in the `app_name` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and needs to know the exact URL of the endpoint to install the application.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the "Copyright Text" field in the application's configuration settings. The application attempts to strip `<script>` tags, but does so non-recursively.
*   **Weakness:** Non-recursive filtering of `<script>` tags allows for bypass using crafted payloads such as `"><script>alert(9)</script>//`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when an authenticated user visits the application, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vector:** Authenticated POST HTTP request to `/rukovoditel_2.4.1/index.php?module=configuration/save&redirect_to=configuration/application` with a crafted payload in the `CFG[APP_COPYRIGHT_NAME]` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify the configuration settings.

Both vulnerabilities highlight the danger of non-recursive filtering mechanisms when attempting to sanitize user input, specifically against XSS attacks.
