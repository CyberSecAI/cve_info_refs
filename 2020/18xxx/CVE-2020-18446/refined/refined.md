The provided content is related to CVE-2020-18446.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization in the `insertContent()` function within `YUNUCMSv1.1.9\app\admin\model\ContentModel.php`. Specifically, the parameters passed to this function are not filtered, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the CMS. These scripts can be stored and executed when other users, including administrators, view the affected content. This could lead to various malicious activities including but not limited to session hijacking, cookie theft, and redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated user (admin) accessing the content management functionality, specifically adding content. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the content fields, the attacker can cause the script to be executed by other users who view the modified content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the CMS backend and add content.
