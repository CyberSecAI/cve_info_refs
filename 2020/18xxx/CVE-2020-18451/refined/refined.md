The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DamiCMS version 6.0.6.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `doadd()` function in `DamicmsV6.0.6\Admin\Lib\Action\LabelAction.class.php` does not filter the `title` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: Malicious code is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the website
- Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `title` parameter when creating or modifying a label in the admin panel.
- The malicious code is then stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the labels.
- Vulnerable URL: `http://localhost/admin.php?s=/Index/index` and navigating to the Label management section and adding a label with malicious code in title field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the DamiCMS application.
- The attacker must be able to navigate to the Label management section and add/edit a label.
