- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize the `$sid` parameter before using it in an SQL UPDATE query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `distcustAjax` function of the `customerAction.php` file due to insufficient filtering of the `sid` POST parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing and retrieving sensitive database information.
    - Data modification: Modifying or deleting records in the database.
    - Database takeover: Executing arbitrary commands on the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `distcustAjax` function.
    - The vulnerable URL is `http://catfish.demo/index.php?a=distcust&m=customer|main/customer&ajaxbool=true`.
    - The `sid` parameter within the POST request can be manipulated with SQL injection payloads
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable URL, which is accessible to regular users of the Rockoa system.
