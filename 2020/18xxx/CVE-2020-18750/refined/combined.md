## Description

![@F1r](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32818831?u=9f0f86a5ce776fd54b3c73ae3d041c2423a038a5&v=4&size=48)[F1r](https://github.com/F1r)opened [on Mar 20, 2019](https://github.com/flexpaper/pdf2json/issues/22#issue-423042193)

In CharCodeToUnicode.cc::264

!pst->getToken(tok3, sizeof(tok3), &n3) || //sizeof(tok3) == 256

here n3 can be a value from 0 to 256 - 2

In CharCodeToUnicode.cc::298

addMapping(code1, tok3 + 1, n3 - 2, i);

In CharCodeToUnicode.cc::313

if (n <= 4) {

if (sscanf(uStr, "%x", &u) != 1) {

error(-1, "Illegal entry in ToUnicode CMap");

return;

}

map[code] = u + offset;

} else {

if (sMapLen >= sMapSize) {

sMapSize = sMapSize + 16;

sMap = (CharCodeToUnicodeString \*)

greallocn(sMap, sMapSize, sizeof(CharCodeToUnicodeString));

}

map[code] = 0;

sMap[sMapLen].c = code;

sMap[sMapLen].len = n / 4;

The parameter n of void CharCodeToUnicode::addMapping(CharCode code, char \*uStr, int n, int offset) can be a bigger value than the the limited value maxUnicodeString

In CharCodeToUnicode.cc::350

sMap[sMapLen].u[sMap[sMapLen].len - 1] += offset;

Using the sample pdf file , we can find the VUL clearly.

sMapLen = 0xf

sMap = 0x6f56f0

pwndbg> p sMap[0xf]

$8 = {

c = 51,

u = {0, 17039378, 4784134, 7208965, 2686984, 14, 542, 185},

len = 12

}

pwndbg> p sMap[sMapLen].len

$9 = 12

so sMap[sMapLen].len - 1 = 13, which makes the array Unicode u[maxUnicodeString]; as follows oob write.

#define maxUnicodeString 8

struct CharCodeToUnicodeString {

CharCode c;

Unicode u[maxUnicodeString];

int len;

};

So, we can modify memory from offset 0 to 63 \* 4 with type unsigned int by adding the original value with offset, which can still be controlled. Local command execution is possible using heap fengshui, especially in the linux machine using glibc version > 2.6. Free a chunk using the bigger fake size can lead to continuously heap buf overflow, which can make the hacker get a memory containing the function pointer and then achieve the purpose of command execution.
