The provided content relates to CVE-2020-18671.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation in the Roundcube installer, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, user-supplied data used in database and SMTP configurations, and email addresses, are not sanitized before being stored and subsequently displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Stored XSS in `/installer/test.php` via database configuration:** When setting up the database connection, specifically for non-SQLite databases, the database host, user, and password fields are not properly sanitized. These unfiltered inputs are stored in the configuration file and later displayed in `/installer/test.php`, leading to XSS.
2.  **Stored XSS in `/installer/test.php` via SMTP configuration:**  Similar to the database configuration, the SMTP configuration fields are not sanitized. Direct output of these unfiltered variables in `installer/test.php` results in stored XSS.
3. **Stored XSS in email address in database:** When a user's email address is stored in the database, it is not sanitized. When retrieving the email address from the database and displaying it, the lack of sanitization allows XSS to occur. This can happen during the installation phase or after user login when user information is retrieved.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Roundcube webmail interface. This can lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Credential theft
*   Malware distribution
*   Defacement of the web interface

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript during the Roundcube installation process or by modifying the database directly if they gain access. The malicious code is stored and executed when the configuration or user data is later displayed in the web interface.
2.  An attacker can insert malicious javascript into the email field. This value is stored in the database and will be rendered during the template rendering process leading to XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Roundcube installer or the database directly if they gain access.
*   For the XSS in the email address, the attacker can manipulate the user identity information either during installation or via the application after gaining access.
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted data to vulnerable input fields during the install process.
