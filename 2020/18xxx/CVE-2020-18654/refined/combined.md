## Description

![@donky16](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24637333?u=eaea9f8876cd249aa8062a4c24a905add39bffea&v=4&size=48)[donky16](https://github.com/donky16)opened [on Mar 12, 2019](https://github.com/wuzhicms/wuzhicms/issues/174#issue-419844137)
> This is a stored XSS which allows attacker to insert javascript code into database. When admin see the message, attacker is able to steal admin's cookie.

**Filename** /coreframe/app/guestbook/myissue.php

**Code**

```
public function ask() {
        $formdata = array();
        $formdata['title'] = isset($GLOBALS['title']) ? remove_xss($GLOBALS['title']) : strcut($GLOBALS['content'],80);
        $formdata['content'] = remove_xss($GLOBALS['content']);
        $formdata['addtime'] = SYS_TIME;
        $formdata['publisher'] = $this->memberinfo['username'];
        $formdata['ip'] = get_ip();
        $this->db->insert('guestbook', $formdata);
        MSG('您的提问已经提交，我们的专家会尽快给您回复',$GLOBALS['forward']);
    }
```

**Exploit**

When we post data without parameter `title`, there will be 80 chars we can use to write payload.

**POC**

```
