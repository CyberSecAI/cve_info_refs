{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DCCE MAC1100 PLC has a vulnerability where it doesn't properly handle specific network packets on port 11000 (EPA protocol). Specifically, when the 14th byte of the packet is not \\x01, the PLC will reject the service and enters a denial of service state.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of network packets leading to a denial-of-service condition. The PLC does not handle the exception packet correctly.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack results in a persistent denial of service, interrupting the normal operation of the PLC controller. The PLC becomes unresponsive and communication is interrupted, causing the device to become non-functional.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via network packets sent to the PLC on port 11000 (EPA protocol). The attacker sends a crafted UDP packet to the PLC, triggering the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the PLC on port 11000. This typically means being on the same network as the PLC or having network access to the device."
