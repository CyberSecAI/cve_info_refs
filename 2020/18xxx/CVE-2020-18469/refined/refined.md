The provided content describes two distinct Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Rukovoditel 2.4.1, which are not related to CVE-2020-18469.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper input sanitization of the "Name of application" field during the application installation process.
*   **Weakness:** The application attempts to strip `<script>` tags, but it is not done recursively. This allows attackers to bypass the filter by injecting payloads like `"><script>alert(1)</script>//`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the application, even when unauthenticated. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vector:**
    *   An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `rukovoditel_2.4.1/install/index.php` during installation.
    *   The payload is inserted into the `app_name` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application during installation.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper input sanitization of the "Copyright Text" field in the "Application" settings page under "Configuration".
*   **Weakness:** Similar to the first vulnerability, the application attempts to strip `<script>` tags non-recursively. This allows an attacker to bypass the filter using payloads like `"><script>alert(9)</script>//`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when the victim visits the configuration page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vector:**
    *   An authenticated attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/rukovoditel_2.4.1/index.php?module=configuration/save&redirect_to=configuration/application`.
    *   The payload is inserted into the `CFG[APP_COPYRIGHT_NAME]` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:**
    *   Requires an authenticated user account.

The suggested fix for both vulnerabilities is to recursively strip out the `<script>` and `</script>` tags.
