The provided content describes four CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities in Pluck CMS version 4.7.9.

**Root Cause:**
The application fails to implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms for administrative actions, allowing an attacker to trigger actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator without their knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Lack of CSRF tokens or other CSRF protection measures.
*   Use of GET requests for sensitive operations (delete actions).
*   Vulnerable administrative actions: deleting images, themes, modules, and pages

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions, including:
    * Deleting arbitrary images.
    * Deleting themes.
    * Deleting modules.
    * Deleting pages.
    * The attacker can effectively damage the website

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker can embed malicious HTML (e.g., using `<iframe>` tags) into a webpage or email.
*   If an administrator opens the malicious page while logged into Pluck CMS, the malicious code will execute the delete actions in the background.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to entice an administrator to open a webpage containing the malicious payload.
*   The targeted administrator must be logged into the Pluck CMS instance when the malicious action is triggered.
*   No prior knowledge of specific page/image/module names is needed, as these are passed as arguments, and thus are discoverable by inspecting the admin panel.
