Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-18662:

**1. Limited Reflected XSS in `bbs/login.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$url` parameter in `bbs/login.php` is not properly sanitized. While single and double quotes are filtered, other characters like `<` and `>` are not. Additionally, if the URL doesn't start with `http` or `https`, it's treated as a path without further checks. The `goto_url` function then directly concatenates this unsanitized URL into JavaScript code when headers have already been sent.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input sanitization of the `$url` parameter.
    *   Direct insertion of user-controlled data into JavaScript context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can lead to:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript payload injected into the `$url` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft malicious URLs and induce a victim to click on the crafted URL.

**2. Reflected XSS in `bbs/move_update.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$act` parameter in `bbs/move_update.php`, received from `common.php`, undergoes only single and double quote filtering. Characters like `<` and `>` are not filtered. The value of `$act` is then directly used in the page output.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input sanitization of the `$act` parameter.
    *   Direct insertion of user-controlled data into HTML context.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Similar to the previous XSS vulnerability:
    *   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
    *   This can result in redirection, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting a request to `bbs/move_update.php` with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `$act` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft a malicious request and induce the victim to perform the request.

**3. SQL Injection in `install_db.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$table_prefix` parameter received via POST in `install_db.php` is filtered by `safe_install_string_check`. This function only checks for "evil keywords", allowing for SQL injection using backticks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient input sanitization of the `$table_prefix` parameter.
    *   Vulnerable SQL queries where user input is directly included without proper escaping or parameterized queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, leading to:
    *   Database data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    *   Potential full compromise of the application and the underlying database server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting a POST request to `install_db.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `$table_prefix` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send POST requests to the `install_db.php` page during installation process.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
The identified vulnerabilities highlight issues with input validation and sanitization in gnuboard5 before version 5.3.2.8, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities are located in the files `bbs/login.php`, `bbs/move_update.php`, and `install_db.php`.
The vulnerable parameters are `$url` (in login.php), `$act` (in move_update.php), and `$table_prefix` (in install_db.php)

The attacker can inject malicious Javascript into the vulnerable parameters to execute arbitrary code on the client side.
The attacker can also inject malicious SQL statements to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
