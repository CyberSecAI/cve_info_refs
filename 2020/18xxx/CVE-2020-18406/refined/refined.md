The provided content describes a security vulnerability in CMSEasy V7.0, where user credentials are sent in clear text during login and registration processes. This aligns with the general nature of a CVE involving sensitive data exposure.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption of user credentials (usernames and passwords) when they are transmitted via HTTP requests during the user registration, user login, and administrator login processes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (user credentials)
- Lack of encryption or hashing of passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stealing User Information
- Stealing Administrator Account

**Attack vectors:**
- Network sniffing/packet capture of HTTP requests.
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as on the same local network, or have the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- No specific user interaction is required other than the vulnerable user performing login or registration.
