- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied input when rendering the `<EMBED>` tag. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or validate the `src` attribute of the `<EMBED>` tag which can contain a data URI with malicious JavaScript code embedded in an SVG image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject a malicious `<EMBED>` tag, including the `src` attribute that contains a data URI with malicious SVG, into the application. When the application renders this content in the user's browser, the script embedded in the SVG image is executed, leading to an XSS attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious code into a location where it will be rendered by the application and interpreted by a user's web browser. In this case, the attacker includes a malicious `<EMBED>` tag into the application (likely through a comment or user supplied field).
