- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `bl-kernel/ajax/upload-logo.php` file, where there is insufficient validation of uploaded file types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability. The application fails to check the file type, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including executable PHP files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload and execute malicious PHP files on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself, allowing for actions such as data theft, defacement, or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the file upload functionality in `bl-kernel/ajax/upload-logo.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the application. They do not require any special privileges other than the ability to use the file upload feature.
