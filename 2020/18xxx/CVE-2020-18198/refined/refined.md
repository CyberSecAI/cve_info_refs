The provided content describes four distinct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Pluck CMS 4.7.9.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause for all four vulnerabilities is the lack of CSRF protection in the Pluck CMS application. The application does not validate the origin of requests for actions that modify data. Specifically, the application uses GET requests for actions like deleting images, themes, modules, and pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **CSRF Vulnerability**: The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to perform state-changing actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Image Deletion**: An attacker can force an administrator to delete specified images.
-   **Theme Deletion**: An attacker can force an administrator to delete specified themes.
-   **Module Deletion**: An attacker can force an administrator to delete specified modules.
-   **Page Deletion**: An attacker can force an administrator to delete specified articles/pages.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector for all four vulnerabilities is a malicious website or email containing a crafted iframe that sends a GET request to the vulnerable Pluck CMS application. When a logged-in administrator visits the malicious content, the browser automatically sends the request to the vulnerable application, thus deleting specified content without the user's explicit permission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to know the URLs and parameters used for the deletion actions.
-   The attacker does not need to know the victim's password, but the victim needs to be logged into the Pluck CMS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick an admin user into visiting the malicious link, via methods like an email or website.
