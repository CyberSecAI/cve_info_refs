Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises because the application, Hucart CMS v5.7.4, fails to sanitize user-supplied input when updating user information, specifically the nickname field (`usd_nick`). This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided data before it's stored in the database.
- **Stored XSS:** This is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious code is permanently saved within the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected user's information (in this case their profile)
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal user session cookies, leading to account compromise.
- **Phishing:** It could be used to redirect users to malicious websites, or display fake login forms.
- **Defacement:** The injected code could modify the page's appearance, potentially leading to defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `update_user` endpoint (`/hucart/user/index.php?load=user_info&act=update_user`) of the web application.
- The request includes a malicious JavaScript payload within the `usd_nick` parameter, specifically `"><img src=# onerror=alert(1)>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the application to modify their user information.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send the malicious request.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content also includes a Proof of Concept (POC) which demonstrates how to register a user, login and then inject the XSS payload. It also provides the full HTTP request used to perform the attack including the payload, headers, parameters etc.
