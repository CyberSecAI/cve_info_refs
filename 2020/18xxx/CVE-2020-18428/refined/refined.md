Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-18428:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-range access occurs within the `SaveEXR` function. Specifically, the code attempts to access an element at index 0 of a `std::vector<float>` when the vector is either empty or does not contain the requested index.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-range access:** The code lacks proper bounds checking before accessing elements of the `std::vector`, leading to an out-of-range read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Application crash:** The out-of-range access triggers a `std::out_of_range` exception, leading to program termination. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted input:** A specially crafted EXR image, when processed with `SaveEXR`, can trigger the out-of-range condition, likely by providing specific width, height, or component values that cause the vector access to be out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input (malicious EXR) to the application that uses the vulnerable `tinyexr` library and specifically triggers the `SaveEXR` function. This implies the attacker must be in a position to control the input data processed by the application.
