The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Hucart CMS v5.7.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the "con_content" field in the "Purchasing Consultation" feature is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user input from the 'con_content' parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate the SQL query to potentially:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system by injecting malicious SQL code

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/user/index.php?load=comment&act=add_buy`.
- The malicious input is injected via the `con_content` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Hucart CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
