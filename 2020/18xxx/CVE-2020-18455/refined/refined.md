The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BYCMS version 1.3.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization or filtering of the `title` parameter within the `edit()` function of the `Document.php` controller in the BYCMS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or filtering of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `title` field.
- When other users, particularly administrators, access the affected page, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the BYCMS administrative panel.
- Specifically, the attacker must:
  1. Log in as an administrator.
  2. Navigate to the document editing section (`/admin.php/document/index/module_id/9/group_id/7.html`).
  3. Modify the content of a document, injecting malicious JavaScript into the `title` field.
  4. Save the changes.
- When other users view the edited document, the malicious script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the BYCMS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to edit document titles within the CMS.
