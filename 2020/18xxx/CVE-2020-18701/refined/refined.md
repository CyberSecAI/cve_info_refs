Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-18701:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content is related to an issue reported in the `lin-cms-flask` repository, specifically issue #30, titled "Identity authentication vulnerability in Latest Release". The description details a vulnerability related to token invalidation after logout. While the issue report is related to an authentication vulnerability, it's not clear if this maps directly to CVE-2020-18701. Therefore further investigation would be required.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to invalidate the authentication token upon user logout. This means the token remains valid even after a user has logged out of the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Session Management:** The system does not properly invalidate authentication tokens on logout.
    *   **Token Reuse:**  An attacker can reuse a token obtained before logout to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can replay network requests with the valid token to perform actions as the logged-out user, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modification of information or further attacks against the application or its data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network packet capture: An attacker intercepts network requests of a logged-in user, then captures and replays the request with the authentication token after the user has logged out.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to monitor network traffic to capture authentication tokens.
    *   Ability to replay network requests.
    *   No specific privileges or high-level access is required

**3. Additional Notes**

The report includes a screenshot demonstrating the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**4. Conclusion**

The issue describes a session management vulnerability where tokens aren't invalidated on logout. This is a fairly common vulnerability and the provided description is useful.

Given the above analysis, if the official CVE-2020-18701 is related to session invalidation, this content provides relevant details regarding the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
