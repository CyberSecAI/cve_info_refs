The provided content describes Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which matches the general description of CVE-2020-18129.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   CSRF exploits the web's authentication mechanism, which only verifies that a request originates from a user's browser but doesn't ensure that the user willingly initiated the request.
*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that a user's browser, after successful authentication with a web application, will automatically send cookies (including session cookies) with subsequent requests to the same domain. This allows an attacker to forge requests without having to know the actual credentials of the user, relying on the browser to send them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Lack of proper request verification on the server side.
*   The vulnerability lies in the web application's failure to distinguish between legitimate user actions and malicious requests forged by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a logged-in user's browser to perform unwanted actions on a web application.
*   This includes operations like sending emails/messages or financial transactions like transferring funds or purchasing items.
*   Attackers cannot directly gain control of user accounts or steal user data, but they can trick a user's browser into executing actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL or HTML form that initiates a request to a targeted web application.
*   This malicious code can be embedded into various places such as other websites, forums, blogs, or any site with user-generated content.
*   The attacker tricks a logged-in user to visit the malicious website or trigger the forged request in some way (e.g., via an image tag, hidden form, link).
*   When the user's browser sends the request, the web application, if vulnerable, will perform the action as if it were a legitimate user-initiated action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious request that targets a web application vulnerable to CSRF.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering the malicious request via a browser.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the user's credentials or session cookies.
*   The attacker does not need to control the targeted website, only to be able to trick the user's browser into sending a request.

The content also describes two common mitigation methods for CSRF attacks:

1.  **Checking the Referer header:** The server checks the `Referer` header of an HTTP request, which indicates the origin of the request. This method is unreliable since `Referer` headers can be spoofed or are not always sent by the browser.
2.  **Adding a CSRF token:** The server generates a unique, unpredictable token and includes it in forms and requests. This token is not stored in cookies and is only known by the server and the user's session. The server then validates the token on each sensitive request. This method is more robust.
