The provided content discusses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Pbootcms version 1.3.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `mod()` function within `apps\admin\controller\content\SingleController.php`, where the `title` parameter is not properly filtered before being rendered in the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the `title` field and stored in the database. When the page is viewed, this code will be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by logging in as an administrator.
- The attacker then navigates to the single page content modification section.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `title` field when editing content.
- Upon viewing the page displaying this modified content, the stored XSS will be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the content modification section of the Pbootcms.
