      "CSRF vulnerability in password reset functionality"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can reset the password of any user account on the application, leading to account takeover.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a password reset request to the vulnerable application. This request will appear to be initiated by the user due to missing CSRF protection, allowing the attacker to change the user's password.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage or link. The attacker also needs to know or be able to guess user IDs in order to target specific accounts. The attacker would also need knowledge of the password reset request format."
