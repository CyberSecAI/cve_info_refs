```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-supplied data (the 'ip' parameter in the POST request) directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or even complete system compromise. Specifically, in this context an attacker could add a malicious IP address to the banned list with an arbitrarily long expiration by manipulating POST data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the '/whatsns/index.php?admin_banned/add.html' endpoint, where the 'ip' parameter contains malicious SQL code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and should have knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the payload and exploit it."
