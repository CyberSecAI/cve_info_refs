The provided content is related to CVE-2020-18693.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input sanitization in the "title" parameter when creating or editing articles within the MineWebCMS administration panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the title of an article. When a user views the article, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing of session cookies.
    - Redirection to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "title" field when creating or editing a news article via the administration panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of MineWebCMS. This may require valid login credentials.
- The attacker must be able to navigate to the "Customization" and "News" sections of the admin panel and have the ability to create or edit articles.
- The attacker needs to input the malicious payload `<script>alert("test")</script>` into the title field.
