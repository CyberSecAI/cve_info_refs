The provided content describes two issues in the `libpff` library, specifically heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities. Although these are not directly related to the specified CVE-2020-18897, the content provides useful information.

**Issue #62: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free at libpff_item_tree.c:828**

*   **Root cause:** A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `libpff_item_tree.c` file at line 828.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Heap-use-after-free.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Undefined behavior, likely leading to a crash, and potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PFF file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted PFF file to an application using the vulnerable `libpff` library.

**Issue #61: libpff_item_tree_create_node 4 byte read of cached out value**

*   **Root cause:** A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `libpff_item_tree.c` file at line 816. It involves reading a 4-byte value from a cached-out memory location.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Heap-use-after-free.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Undefined behavior, likely leading to a crash, and potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PFF file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted PFF file to an application using the vulnerable `libpff` library.

Both issues are related to heap-use-after-free scenarios within the `libpff_item_tree.c` file, though at different locations (lines 828 and 816 respectively). They also provide proof-of-concept (POC) files and AddressSanitizer (ASan) outputs that can be used to reproduce these vulnerabilities.

Based on the description provided, these issues are likely related to the same root cause, i.e a memory management issue when handling item trees in PFF files.
