## Description

![@0FuzzingQ](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27672638?u=20419b1be23bf00bd77a9dfae7d40fa5bd995bed&v=4&size=48)[0FuzzingQ](https://github.com/0FuzzingQ)opened [on Feb 12, 2019](https://github.com/Neeke/HongCMS/issues/11#issue-409128664)

there is an arbitrary file read and rewrite in the backend of this cms via the link:

/hcms/admin/index.php/language/ajax

when post params : filename=..%2f..%2ftest.php&action=savelang&filecontent=%3C%3Fphp%0D%0A%0D%0Aecho+phpinfo()%3B%0D%0A%3F%3E

in the latest V4.0.0 edtion,

the cms try to use ajax to escape attacker to do same dangerous action like change file name etc

but it can also be catched by proxy

it will write your payload into any file which is writeable

we create new file test.php to check this vuln:

we can access to it via link as <http://domain/your> file name
