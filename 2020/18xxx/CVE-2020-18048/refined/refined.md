Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `craigms/main.php` file, specifically around line 74, where user-supplied input is directly passed to a function (likely `mysqli_connect`) without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The lack of input filtering allows an attacker to inject malicious commands within the database connection parameters, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server. Specifically, the injected values are used in `mysqli_connect`, which is not expected to execute arbitrary commands, but some custom/modified version could.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it in a sensitive operation like a database connection. This opens the door for various injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This can lead to a full system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database or other sensitive data through this vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker may be able to disrupt the application and make it unavailable.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** With command execution, the attacker can potentially take over the entire system hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `craigms/main.php` script.
*   **Malicious Input:** The malicious input is sent as part of the POST request to influence the parameters used by `mysqli_connect`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Understanding of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft malicious inputs that, when combined with the vulnerable code, leads to the execution of arbitrary system commands
*   **Database Name:** The attacker needs to know a valid database name present in the target server, even though this is not a very strong requirement for exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided images in the Github issue clearly demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The issue also mentions that the vulnerability is present in the `check_login.php` file.
*   The issue was reported in 2019.
