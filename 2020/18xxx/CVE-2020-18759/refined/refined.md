{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DCCE MAC1100 PLC communicates using the EPA protocol on port 11000. An unauthorized EPA read operation allows an attacker to read specific storage areas.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive Information Disclosure",
      "Unauthorized access to PLC memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can collect sensitive device information from the PLC, which can be used for PLC device authentication attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted EPA read request to the PLC via UDP on port 11000.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the PLC and the ability to send UDP packets to port 11000."
