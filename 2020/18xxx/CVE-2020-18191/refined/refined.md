The provided content is related to CVE-2020-18191.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `log` parameter in `admin/log.php`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, leading to arbitrary file deletion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied file paths.
- **Arbitrary file deletion:** The application allows deletion of arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability.
- **Lack of access control:** It seems the deletion action can be initiated with valid `nonce` and admin credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** Attackers can delete critical system files, potentially rendering the website or application non-functional.
- **Data loss:** Deleting critical data files can result in the loss of essential information.
- **Potential for further compromise:** If the attacker can delete crucial configuration files, it could open the system up to additional attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack can be triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to `admin/log.php`.
- **`log` parameter manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `log` parameter to traverse the file system and target any file on the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid admin session cookie and valid nonce.
- The attacker should be able to send HTTP requests to the target server
