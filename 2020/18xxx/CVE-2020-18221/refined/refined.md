The provided content describes a vulnerability in Typora version v0.9.65, where an XSS vulnerability can be exploited to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of SVG and iframe elements within Typora, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied content within SVG and iframe tags.
- Improper use of `srcdoc` attribute allowing for injecting HTML and JavaScript payload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system by leveraging the XSS to execute JavaScript which in turn spawns a process using the `process.spawn` function, leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious markdown file that contains a specially crafted SVG tag with an embedded iframe that executes JavaScript.
- When a victim opens this markdown file using the vulnerable Typora version, the malicious JavaScript code will run.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious markdown file to the victim.
- The victim has to use a vulnerable version of Typora.
