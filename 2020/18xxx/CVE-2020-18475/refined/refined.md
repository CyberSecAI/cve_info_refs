The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `mes_title` field. Specifically, HTML code is not escaped and is rendered directly by the browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Malicious JavaScript code injected by one user will be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the message. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the web application.
    *   Other malicious actions depending on the injected script.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the `mes_title` field of a message.
*   The payload includes `<script>` tags with JavaScript code to execute.
*   The attacker sends a message that includes the malicious script to other users.
*   When another user views the message, the malicious script is executed within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application and have the ability to send messages.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `mes_title` field in the message creation form.
