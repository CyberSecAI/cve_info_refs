Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient buffer size when handling the input provided in the "Virtual Path Mapping" field when adding a new path in the FTPShell Server configuration.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer overflow: The application does not properly validate the length of the input provided to the "Virtual Path Mapping" field when adding a new path. This lack of validation allows an attacker to provide an input larger than the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of Service (DoS): The buffer overflow leads to the application crashing, resulting in a denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- The attack vector is through the application's graphical user interface (GUI) when configuring FTP accounts. Specifically, when adding a new path.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs access to the FTPShell Server GUI to configure FTP accounts. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "Manage FTP Accounts" and "Configure accounts..." options.
- The attacker needs the ability to input text into the "Virtual Path Mapping" field, including being able to paste text from the clipboard.
