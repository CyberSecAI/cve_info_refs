Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin.php` script, specifically in the handling of the `user_phone` parameter within a query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This means the attacker doesn't directly see the results of their SQL queries in the application's response, but can infer information based on the application's behavior (e.g., time delays, or boolean-based responses).
    - **Boolean-based blind SQL injection:** The attacker can use SQL boolean operators and logic to determine if their statements are true.
    - **Time-based blind SQL injection:** The attacker can induce delays using functions like `SLEEP()` to confirm if their query is executed by the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the `user_phone` parameter, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, order details, or other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** With sufficient privileges, an attacker could also modify or delete data from the database.
- **Denial of Service:** In some cases, a time-based injection might induce delays causing a denial of service.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Successful SQL injection can sometimes be a stepping stone to further compromise of the server, depending on the application and server configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts malicious HTTP GET requests to `/phpshe/admin.php`, injecting SQL code through the `user_phone` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft their payloads.
- **No authentication required:** Based on provided information, it seems like the vulnerability is exploitable even without being logged in.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

- **Vulnerable URL:** `/phpshe/admin.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `user_phone`
- **Example Exploit Payloads (from sqlmap output):**
   - `user_phone=1' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (4784=4784) THEN 1 ELSE 0x28 END))-- EfBd` (Boolean-based blind)
   - `user_phone=1' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))hxbT)-- YEPD` (Time-based blind)
- **SQL Injection Types:** Boolean-based blind and time-based blind.
- **Targeted DBMS:** MySQL.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including specific code snippets, exploit payloads and SQL injection types.
- The gitee issue mentions that the vulnerability was reported on 2018-12-26, but is still open, implying it is yet to be patched in the given version of `phpshe`.
