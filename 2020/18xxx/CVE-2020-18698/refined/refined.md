{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The login functionality in `app/api/cms/user.py` at line 43 within the `login()` function does not implement rate limiting or verification codes, allowing for brute-force attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing rate limiting on login attempts",
      "Absence of verification codes or CAPTCHA"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a brute-force attack to guess usernames and passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending repeated login requests with different credentials."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the login endpoint of the application. No special access is required."
