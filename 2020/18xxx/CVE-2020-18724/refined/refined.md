Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-18724:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in two specific areas of the MDaemon Webmail application: the email attachment field and the contact name field within distribution lists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via file names and contact names and stored on the server. When this data is later viewed by other users or even the attacker, the injected script is executed within the user's browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive user data may be accessed or exfiltrated.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or distribute malware.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the webmail interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Email Attachment Filenames:** An attacker can craft an email attachment with a malicious XSS payload in the filename (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.jpg`). When the email is viewed, and especially when forwarded, the XSS is triggered.
*   **Distribution List Contact Names:** An attacker can create or edit a distribution list and inject an XSS payload into the contact name field (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`). Each time the distribution list is viewed, the XSS is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to MDaemon Webmail:** The attacker must have access to an MDaemon webmail account.
*   **Ability to Send Emails/Create Distribution Lists:** The attacker must be able to compose emails with attachments and create or modify distribution lists.
*   **Social engineering:** the attacker may need to induce the victim to forward an email, or visit the contact list page

**Additional Information**
*   The content indicates the vulnerability affects MDaemon Webmail versions prior to 20.0.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the MDaemon team, and a fix was released in version 20.0.1 on August 18, 2020.
*  CVE-2020-18723 is also mentioned, indicating another XSS vulnerability was reported concurrently with CVE-2020-18724
