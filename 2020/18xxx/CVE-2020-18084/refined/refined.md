The provided content relates to CVE-2020-18084.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `referer` parameter within the login functionality of yzmcms v5.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, it appears to be a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the website
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Stealing sensitive user information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `referer` parameter of the `/member/index/login.html` endpoint. An attacker can craft a malicious POST request that injects a JavaScript payload within the `referer` parameter, and if a user is tricked into submitting the crafted request, the injected script will execute in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious POST request and potentially trick a user into submitting that request by leveraging social engineering or other means. The attacker does not need any special permissions or credentials beforehand; however, the attack is only successful if a user is logged in, or is prompted to log in after being redirected.
