## Description

![@thatsa9](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60623594?v=4&size=48)[thatsa9](https://github.com/thatsa9)opened [on Feb 5, 2020](https://github.com/bludit/bludit/issues/1132#issue-560129293)
### Describe

This vulnerability allows Editor or Author roles could insert malicious JavaScript on the WYSIWYG editor.

### Steps to reproduce the vulnerability

Affected in Bludit v3.10.0

1. Tried to login with username “admon2”, who is an Editor. Then, pressed the button.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60623594/73810198-5028a280-4808-11ea-9dd8-3f537c811964.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60623594/73810198-5028a280-4808-11ea-9dd8-3f537c811964.png)

We inserted a simple HTML+JavaScript for PoC.

As a result, we could insert malicious JavaScript on the WYSIWYG editor.

But the CMS had inserted HttpOnly when web applications issued a token to web browser, resulting in the attacker couldn’t steal the cookie.

But the attacker still crafted malicious JavaScript to do anything. I.e. enforce every legitimate user to logout on the web application

As a result, we could enforce legitimated users to logout.
