The content is related to CVE-2020-8812.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WYSIWYG editor in Bludit v3.10.0 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the insertion of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with Editor or Author role privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code. This code can be used to perform actions on behalf of other users, such as forcing them to log out, or potentially other malicious activities. Although the HttpOnly flag prevents cookie theft, the attacker can still execute JavaScript to perform arbitrary actions on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker needs to log in with Editor or Author privileges and insert the malicious JavaScript through the WYSIWYG editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a user with at least Editor privileges on the Bludit CMS.
