Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the cron job used by the `texlive-filesystem` package. This cron job, intended to clean up outdated files, uses the `rm` command as root to delete files within directories that are accessible to unprivileged users in the `mktex` group. The combination of root privileges and unprivileged user-controlled paths leads to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition. An attacker who has compromised a user in the `mktex` group can manipulate the directory structure in `/var/cache/texmf`, including the creation of symlinks or files, that the root cron job will try to remove. Because `rm` is not safe against symlinks a compromised user can trick the root cron job into removing arbitrary files outside of the intended directories.
2.  **Privilege Escalation:** Although the root user is intended to clean up outdated files, this functionality can be abused by users in the `mktex` group to remove any file on the system that root has access to. This is a local privilege escalation.
3.  **Use of Unsafe Utilities:** The use of `rm` by root is unsafe in the context of files and directories that can be modified by unprivileged users. Safe alternatives like `tmpwatch` or `systemd-tmpfiles` were not used initially.
4. **Inconsistent File Ownership:**  The `ls-R` files within `/var/cache/texmf/`  are created with root:mktex ownership in the spec file during installation but are recreated with nobody:mktex ownership by `mktexlsr` . This disagreement in behavior contributed to the vulnerability and made it more difficult to handle file deletions safely.
5.  **Sticky Bit Misuse:**  The sticky bit on directories was misused as a security protection, rather than it being a tool for specific use cases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to delete any file on the system that the root user has the permissions to remove. This can cause significant damage by compromising files necessary for system operation, configurations, or any other system related file.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By deleting critical system files, the attacker can cause a DoS by preventing the system from functioning properly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack is performed locally on the system.
*   **Compromised Group Member:** The attacker needs to be a compromised member of the `mktex` group or a user that can influence the contents of directories and files within `/var/cache/texmf/`.
*   **Manipulating Directories:** The attacker can manipulate the directory structure and file contents in `/var/cache/texmf`  to exploit the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target system.
*   **Membership in `mktex` Group (or equivalent):** The user should be able to write or manipulate contents of `/var/cache/texmf` if not directly via group `mktex`, then via compromised user with the right group permissions,
*   **Ability to Create Symlinks:** The attacker must have the ability to create symlinks in `/var/cache/texmf/`.
*   **Ability to trigger cron job:**  The attacker does not need to directly trigger the cron job, simply manipulate directory structure and files before the cron job is automatically triggered.

**Additional Notes**

*   The bug report shows a discussion about the ownership and usage of the `/var/cache/texmf` directory and files, including concerns that switching the ownership to `nobody:mktex` might create a new attack surface.
*   The fix involves several steps: changing the ownership of directories, changing the way files are created and deleted to avoid the race conditions, and removing usages of the unsafe utilities `safe-rm` and `safe-rmdir`.
*   The SUSE Security team implemented a policy requiring issues to become public after a maximum of 90 days of embargo to ensure known vulnerabilities don't stay private for too long.
