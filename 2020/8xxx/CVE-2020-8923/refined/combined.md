# XSS vulnerability in dart:html

Moderate

[kevmoo](/kevmoo)
published
GHSA-hfq3-v9pv-p627
Mar 24, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.7.1

## Patched versions

2.7.2

## Description

### Impact

The validation logic that exists in dart:html for creating DOM nodes from text (String instances) was missing checks that allow for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks using Dom clobbering.

Affected APIs are those that take in a [NodeValidator](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/NodeValidator-class.html) and include the [Element.html](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Element/Element.html.html)

constructor, as well as the Element functions [setInnerHtml](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Element/setInnerHtml.html), [appendHtml](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Element/appendHtml.html), and [insertAdjacentHtml](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Element/insertAdjacentHtml.html). There are similar APIs on [DocumentFragment](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/DocumentFragment-class.html).

NodeValidator is used to prevent Dom Clobbering Attacks. There are cases where carefully crafting user input can be used to corrupt previousNode or previousSibling on a DOM element to enable a XSS attack.

All Dart SDK releases including and before 2.7.1 and 2.8.0-dev.16.0 are affected.

### Patches

If you're using a stable release of Dart, version 2.7.2 or later contain changes that address this vulnerability.

If you're using a dev release of Dart, version 2.8.0-dev.17.0 or later.

### Workarounds

If you cannot update the Dart SDK you are using to rebuild your applications, we recommend you review uses of the affected APIs. Pay special attention to cases where user-provided data is used to populate DOM nodes.

Consider using [Element.innerText](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Element/innerText.html) or [Node.text](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-html/Node/text.html) to populate DOM elements.
