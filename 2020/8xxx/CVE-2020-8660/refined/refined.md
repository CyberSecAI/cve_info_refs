```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TLS inspector listener filter could be bypassed by a client using only TLS 1.3, as TLS extensions (SNI, ALPN) were not inspected.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the TLS inspector filter's inability to properly inspect TLS 1.3 connections, leading to a bypass of the intended filter chain.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to connections being matched to an incorrect filter chain, potentially bypassing security restrictions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, exploiting the TLS handshake with a client using only TLS 1.3.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need the ability to initiate TLS 1.3 connections to the vulnerable service."
