Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8861:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the incorrect implementation of the HNAP (Home Network Administration Protocol) login algorithm within D-Link DAP-1330 Wi-Fi range extenders.
*   Specifically, the issue is related to the improper handling of cookies during HNAP login requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the authentication mechanism of the device.
*   **Lack of Proper Cookie Handling:** The software fails to properly handle cookies during authentication, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected router.
*   **Admin Password Reset:** Attackers can bypass authentication to reset the administrator password
*   **Full device compromise:** Given the potential for arbitrary code execution, a successful exploit would allow the attacker to have complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Adjacent:** The attack vector is network-adjacent. This means the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the local network where the D-Link DAP-1330 is connected.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Product:** D-Link DAP-1330 Wi-Fi range extender.
*   **Affected Firmware:** Firmware versions v1.10B01\_Beta and below.
*   **Patch Available:** D-Link has released a firmware update (v1.13B01\_Beta) to address this vulnerability.
