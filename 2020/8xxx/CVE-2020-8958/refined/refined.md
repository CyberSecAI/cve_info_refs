{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `Dest IP Address` field of the `/boaform/admin/formPing` endpoint. Specifically, it does not neutralize shell metacharacters, which are then passed to the underlying operating system, leading to command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary OS command execution on the device. This can lead to full compromise of the device, including the ability to exfiltrate data, manipulate device settings, or use the device as part of a botnet.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/boaform/admin/formPing` endpoint with shell metacharacters in the `target_addr` field"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to the device, and must possess valid administrative credentials for the device's web management interface (or exploit an authentication bypass vulnerability in conjunction with this vulnerability). The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP POST request containing shell metacharacters."
