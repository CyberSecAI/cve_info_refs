Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in a subsystem of certain Intel Server Boards, Systems, and Compute Modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where the system attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher privileges on the system. This could lead to full system control or access to sensitive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local, meaning that an attacker needs to have some form of access to the system already.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged User: The attacker must be a privileged user on the system to exploit the vulnerability successfully.
