Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the VGA virtual device of Parallels Desktop. Specifically, the issue is an out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-Bounds Write: The core weakness is that user-controlled data can be written past the boundaries of an allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The vulnerability arises because the VGA virtual device doesn't properly validate user-provided data before writing it into memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A successful exploit allows a local attacker with high-privileged code execution on the guest system to escalate their privileges to the hypervisor level.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The ability to write outside allocated memory can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the hypervisor, granting the attacker control over the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack requires local access to the guest system. This means the attacker must already have some level of privileged code execution within the guest OS.
- Specific Virtual Device: The vulnerability resides in the VGA virtual device of Parallels Desktop.
- User-Supplied Data: Attackers must provide crafted data that, when processed by the vulnerable VGA device, causes an out-of-bounds write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- High-Privileged Code Execution in Guest: The attacker must already be able to execute code with high privileges on the guest operating system.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerability: The attacker needs to understand the specific way to exploit the out-of-bounds write in the VGA device.

**Additional Information:**
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.2, indicating a high severity. The vector string `AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H` means:
    - **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the system.
    - **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The exploit is relatively easy to perform.
    - **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):**  The attacker needs high privileges on the guest OS to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    - **S:C (Scope: Changed):** The vulnerability affects the hypervisor scope, allowing privilege escalation beyond the guest OS.
    - **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** The impact on confidentiality is high as the attacker can read sensitive information from the hypervisor.
    - **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** The impact on integrity is high as the attacker can modify hypervisor settings.
    - **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** The impact on availability is high as the attacker can cause a denial of service or even system crash.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Parallels Desktop version 15.1.3 (47255).
