  "CVE-2020-8201": {
    "description": "Node.js versions 12.x and 14.x are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling. The vulnerability occurs because affected versions convert carriage returns in HTTP request headers to a hyphen before parsing, which is a non-standard interpretation of the header.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "All versions of the 14.x and 12.x release line"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect conversion of carriage returns (CR) to hyphens in HTTP request headers before parsing. This non-standard interpretation leads to inconsistencies in how requests are processed by different systems, potentially causing request smuggling.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP Request Smuggling"
    ],
    "impact": "HTTP Request Smuggling allows an attacker to inject malicious HTTP requests, leading to various attacks like session hijacking, cookie poisoning, and clickjacking depending on the underlying system's architecture. It can lead to privilege escalation, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "The attack vector is network-based, using maliciously crafted HTTP requests with altered header names that exploit the CR-to-Hyphen conversion. The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request that contains a CR character within the header name. The vulnerable server converts this CR to a hyphen which can then be interpreted differently by other web infrastructure components, allowing for HTTP Request Smuggling."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a Node.js server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in how Node.js parses HTTP headers, specifically the treatment of carriage return characters. This inconsistent behavior can lead to desynchronization between the server and its intermediaries (e.g., proxies or load balancers), allowing for the smuggling of requests.",
        "remediation": "Upgrade to Node.js version 14.15.1 or higher, and 12.18.4 or higher."
