Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw present in the password processing mechanism during login when the improved password hashing method is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands by manipulating the password field during the login process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute commands on the system with the privileges of the `iscan` user (as shown in the provided example).
- Combined with other vulnerabilities, such as the lack of authentication checks from localhost, and the lack of CSRF protection for multipart form data, this could lead to complete takeover of the appliance as `root`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA), specifically the login page (`/uilogonsubmit.jsp`).
- An attacker can send a specially crafted POST request with a malicious payload within the password field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the IWSVA appliance and reach the login page

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is triggered when the improved password hashing method is enabled.
- The password field is not properly sanitized, allowing command injection.
- The provided PoC shows that the injected command is executed by the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was initially difficult for the vendor to reproduce.
- There was a lengthy back-and-forth between the security researchers and the vendor to verify and fix the vulnerabilities.
- This vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities that allowed unauthenticated remote root access of the appliance through chaining of vulnerabilities
