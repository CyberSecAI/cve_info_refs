Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect access control in the Docker registry. Deploy tokens with `read_repository` scope (but without `read_registry` scope) were improperly allowed to access the docker registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** Deploy tokens with limited `read_repository` scope could bypass expected access restrictions and gain access to the Docker registry.
- **Lack of proper scope enforcement:** The system did not correctly enforce the intended separation of privileges between `read_repository` and `read_registry` scopes for deploy tokens when accessing the container registry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized read access to the docker registry, potentially exposing container images.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information contained within the container images could be disclosed.
- **Lack of Auditing:** The unauthorized access was not audited, making it difficult to detect or track malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Deploy Tokens:** An attacker could create a deploy token with `read_repository` scope (but not `read_registry` scope) or compromise an existing one.
- **Docker Login:** Using the compromised or newly created token, the attacker could authenticate to the Docker registry via `docker login`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to create a project.
- The attacker needs the ability to create a deploy token or compromise an existing one.
- The attacker needs to be able to use the `docker login` command.

**Versions Affected:**

- GitLab versions 10.7 and later are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne.
- The issue is fixed in GitLab versions 12.8.2, 12.7.7, and 12.6.8.
- The fix involves ensuring that deploy tokens without the `read_registry` scope cannot access the docker registry.
