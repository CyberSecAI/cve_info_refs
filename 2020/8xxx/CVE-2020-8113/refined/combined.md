# ESCALATED: Deploy tokens with read\_repository scope are allowed to access the docker registry

**[HackerOne report #687272](https://hackerone.com/reports/687272)** by `xanbanx` on 2019-09-03, assigned to `jmatos_bgtvf`:

Hi GitLab security team,

### Summary

Deploy tokens can have `read_repository` and `read_registry` scopes. A token that only allows the `read_repository` and **not** the `read_registry` scope can be used to access the docker registry.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a project
2. Create a deploy token with a username and **only** `read_repository` scope
3. Using that token, login to the docker registry via `docker login registry.gitlab.example.com -u -p

```
▶ docker login registry.example.gitlab.com -u <deploy-token-user> -p <deploy-token>
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/rschilling/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

### Impact

This gives unauthorized users access to the docker registry. Furthermore, there is no auditing. So you do not know that a unprivileged token was used to access the registry.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Deploy tokens without `read_registry` scope can be used to access the docker registry.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Deploy tokens without `read_registry` scope \***cannot** be used to access the docker registry.

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

Best regards,

Xanbanx

## Impact

See above.
