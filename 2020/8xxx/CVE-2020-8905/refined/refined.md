The provided content is related to CVE-2020-8905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect `memcpy` operation within the `enc_untrusted_recvfrom` function. The original code used a fixed `len` argument for `memcpy` without validating the size of the received buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The `memcpy` was performed using a user-supplied length `len`, without checking if the actual size of data `buffer_received.size()` was smaller than `len`. If the received data size was smaller than `len`, it could lead to out-of-bounds read. Conversely, if the received buffer size `buffer_received.size()` was larger than `len`, it could result in an out-of-bounds write. The patch fixes this by using `std::min(len, buffer_received.size())` to ensure the copy operation doesn't exceed the bounds of the received buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially cause a buffer overflow by providing a large `len` value, leading to a denial of service, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious user (or a malicious process within a trusted context) providing a large `len` value when calling `enc_untrusted_recvfrom`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to call the `enc_untrusted_recvfrom` function with a crafted `len` argument. This typically implies the attacker has some control over the untrusted side of the application.
