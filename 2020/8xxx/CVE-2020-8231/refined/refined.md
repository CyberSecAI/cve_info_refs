Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-8231:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a dangling pointer issue within libcurl when the `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` option is set while using the multi API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Dangling pointer:**  A pointer is used after the memory it points to has been freed, leading to undefined behavior.
- **Incorrect connection usage:**  The improper pointer handling can result in libcurl using the wrong connection when sending data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** The primary impact is the potential for information disclosure, as data intended for one connection might be sent over a different, unintended connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Exploitation requires using libcurl's multi API and specifically setting the `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to control the application logic that uses libcurl's multi API, allowing them to set the vulnerable option and initiate data transfers.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network segment, the vulnerability is triggered via the libcurl client configuration.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The Gentoo advisory mentions that this could result in "information disclosure or data loss." While data loss is not explicitly mentioned in the other advisories, it is possible if data intended for one connection is lost by being sent to the wrong destination.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4881-1) confirms that the vulnerability is related to libcurl using the wrong connection when the `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` is set, which could lead to information leaks.
*   The Siemens advisory (SSA-389290) further describes the issue as a "use of a dangling pointer" and clarifies that libcurl might use the wrong connection when sending data because of it.

In summary, CVE-2020-8231 involves a dangling pointer in libcurl's multi API when using `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY`, which can cause data to be sent over the wrong network connection, potentially leaking sensitive information.
