Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A timing side-channel existed in how Zcashd handled network messages. Specifically, the time offset between messages could be used to correlate a suspected victim's address with an IP address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Timing Side-Channel:** The vulnerability stemmed from the timing difference in network data returned by a victim node.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Address Correlation:** Attackers could potentially link a Zcash address to the corresponding IP address of the node, compromising user privacy and anonymity.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited through network communication with a Zcash node.
- By analyzing the time offset between messages, an attacker can infer which IP address is associated with a specific address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the victim node over the network.
- The attacker requires the capability to measure and analyze the timing differences in network messages to identify address/IP correlations.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content mentions that this issue was discovered simultaneously by the team who disclosed the PING and REJECT issues (fixed in 2.0.7-3) and the ECC engineering team.
- The fix was implemented in zcashd v2.1.1.
- The vulnerability is different from the consensus failure vulnerability (CVE-2020-8806) also addressed in the same release.
- The vulnerability was addressed for new blocks received over the network
