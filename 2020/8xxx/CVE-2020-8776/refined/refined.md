Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Content analysis:**

The content from `gitlab.com` mentions "XSS的倍數（CVE-2020-8776，CVE-2020-8777，CVE-2020-8778）by by", which translates to "Multiple XSS (CVE-2020-8776, CVE-2020-8777, CVE-2020-8778) by by". This clearly indicates that CVE-2020-8776 is related to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The other two CVEs are mentioned in the same context, suggesting they might be related to the same issue or part of a series of vulnerabilities.

The `packetstormsecurity.com` content is unrelated to the CVE. It describes a lockout mechanism triggered by exceeding rate limits or failed hacking attempts.

**CVE-2020-8776 Analysis:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The specific location or mechanism is not detailed in this content.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation of XSS can lead to a wide range of impacts, such as:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing user cookies/session IDs).
    *   Defacement of web pages.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Phishing attacks.
    *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious script into the vulnerable web application, which is then executed in the browser of another user when they view the affected page or content. The provided content doesn't specify the particular location or mechanism where this injection can take place.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the web application.
    *   They might need to be a user of the application, or if it is a stored XSS, they can leave the script and affect other users.

**Summary:**

The content from `gitlab.com` indicates that CVE-2020-8776 is an XSS vulnerability. While it does not provide specific technical details, it confirms the nature of the vulnerability. The other content is unrelated.
