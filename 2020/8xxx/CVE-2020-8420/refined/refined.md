- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing CSRF token check in the LESS compiler of `com_templates`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability in the LESS compiler.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it. This could be achieved by various methods such as embedding the malicious request in an iframe on a website, sending a malicious link, etc.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a request to the vulnerable application.
