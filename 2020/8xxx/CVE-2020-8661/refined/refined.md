Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8661:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.redhat.com_bc429db2_20250119_124302.html` (specifically the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2020:0734) and `github.com_6297a39e_20250119_124303.html` (GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-36cq-ww7h-p4j7) directly reference CVE-2020-8661 and provide details related to the vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Envoy processes pipelined HTTP/1.1 requests. When Envoy responds internally to illegally formed requests (e.g., by sending a 400 error), it can lead to excessive memory consumption. Specifically, if the client reads these error responses slowly, a large number of responses can accumulate in the Network::Connection buffer, consuming excessive memory. This bypasses Envoy's overload manager, exacerbating the problem.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The core issue is the lack of proper resource management, allowing an attacker to force the system to consume excessive memory.
    *   **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered by malformed HTTP/1.1 requests.
    *   **Bypass of Overload Manager:** The vulnerability bypasses Envoy's built-in overload protection, allowing it to consume resources past defined thresholds.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, where the excessive memory consumption can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The vulnerability leads to the consumption of server memory.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered remotely via a TCP buffer containing multiple pipelined HTTP/1.1 requests. The attack is initiated by sending multiple malformed requests to the target Envoy proxy.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs remote network access to the Envoy proxy and the ability to send malformed HTTP/1.1 requests.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the HTTP/1 codec.
*   The fix is included in Envoy versions 1.13.1 and 1.12.3.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Alyssa Wilk of Google LLC.
*   The Red Hat Security Advisory indicates that the vulnerability affects the `servicemesh-proxy` component of Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 1.0 for RHEL 8.

In summary, CVE-2020-8661 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Envoy that arises from improper handling of pipelined HTTP/1.1 requests leading to uncontrolled resource consumption, which can bypass the overload manager. This can be exploited remotely by an attacker sending malformed requests.
