Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8016:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `%post` section of the `texlive-filesystem` package's spec file. This section is responsible for creating directories and `ls-R` files, which are used by the TeX Live system for font management. Specifically, the spec file uses shell commands that can be exploited when these commands are executed by root on a directory that a low privileged user can manipulate, potentially leading to arbitrary file corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition in spec file:** The `%post` section's logic for creating `ls-R` files is vulnerable. A compromised user in the `mktex` group could create symbolic links in the target directories, which root would follow when creating/overwriting files.
*   **Inconsistent ownership:** The `ls-R` files are initially created by the spec file with `root:mktex` ownership, whereas they are created with `nobody:mktex` ownership when created by the `mktexlsr` tool.
*   **Incorrect sticky bit usage:** The sticky bit on the directories, intended to protect files, was ineffective when root operated within the directories. The sticky bit only restricts file deletion to the owner. Root can still delete files in the directory regardless of the sticky bit.
*   **Unsafe file creation:** The initial creation of ls-R files using shell redirection, `echo '%% ls-R ...' > ${dir}/ls-R`, which are executed as root.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary file corruption/modification:** A compromised user in the `mktex` group could create symbolic links leading to locations outside the intended directory, causing root to overwrite, modify, or delete arbitrary files when creating or overwriting the `ls-R` files via the spec file %post script.
*   **Potential privilege escalation:** Although not directly demonstrated, it was discussed in the comments how manipulating file ownership in a specific way can be leveraged.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** Exploitation requires local access to the system, and the attacker needs to be a member of the `mktex` group (or a compromised `nobody` user if the permissions are such).
*   **Manipulating directory contents:** The attacker creates malicious symlinks in the font directories (e.g., `/var/cache/texmf/fonts`) that point to other system files or directories.
*   **Trigger package install/update**: The attacker needs to wait for a package update/install of texlive-filesystem to trigger the vulnerable %post section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local system access:** The attacker needs a user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Member of `mktex` group or compromised `nobody` user:** The attacker needs to be a member of the `mktex` group or be able to execute code as user `nobody`.
