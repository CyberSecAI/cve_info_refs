Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8112:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor` function within the `openjp2/t1.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This occurs specifically in the `qmfbid==1` case.
*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of image dimensions and memory allocation, which are updated using `opj_j2k_update_image_dimensions` without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite memory on the heap, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **System compromise:** A successful exploit could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a system compromise or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of service:**  The overflow can also lead to a denial-of-service condition due to memory corruption.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Issues:** The vulnerability can compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the target system and resources.
*   **Data corruption:** Exploitation may also result in data corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, suggesting that network access is sufficient. The exploit can be triggered by providing a specially crafted JPEG2000 (JP2) or BMP image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a maliciously crafted image to the vulnerable software.
*   No authentication or user interaction is needed for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details and Context:**

*   The vulnerability exists in OpenJPEG versions 2.3.1 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `openjpeg2-2.3.1-6` for Fedora 30 and Fedora 31.
*   Red Hat also released a security advisory (RHSA-2020:0550) and (RHSA-2020:0570) to address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8 and related products.
*   Debian released security advisories (DLA-2277-1) and (DSA-4882-1) for Debian 9 and Debian 10, respectively, addressing this and other vulnerabilities in OpenJPEG2.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered in the decoder path via specially crafted JPEG2000 image (i.e. `opj_decompress`).

*   An upstream fix is referenced at this [github link](https://github.com/rouault/openjpeg/commit/05f9b91e60debda0e83977e5e63b2e66486f7074).
