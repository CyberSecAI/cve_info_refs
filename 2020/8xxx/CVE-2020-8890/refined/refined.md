Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits, which is likely related to CVE-2020-8890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is related to the bruteforce protection mechanism in the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) application. Specifically, it stems from how the application was handling and comparing usernames and timestamps, potentially allowing attackers to bypass the bruteforce protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Case-sensitive username comparison:** The initial implementation of the bruteforce check used a case-sensitive comparison for usernames, which could be bypassed by attackers using different capitalization of the same username during login attempts. This is addressed in commit `c1a0b3b` by converting username to lowercase during the check.
2.  **Time Discrepancy Handling:** The system was failing when there were discrepancies between the MySQL server time and the web server time. This would potentially cause the bruteforce protection to fail.
3.  **Inconsistent expire time:** The expiration time was not properly set when adding a failed login attempt, and it was missing a conversion to a date-time format to match with the database.
4. **Missing Trim on Username:** The username was not trimmed, allowing to bypass the check by using trailing whitespace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially bypass the bruteforce protection, allowing them to attempt numerous login attempts without being blocked. This could lead to:

*   **Account Compromise:** Successful brute-forcing of user credentials.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By attempting many failed login attempts, an attacker could potentially overload the login system
*   **Resource exhaustion:** Inefficient brute-force handling could cause unnecessary database queries.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Page:** The primary attack vector is the login page of the MISP application. An attacker would attempt to log in using various usernames and passwords.
*   **Automated Scripts:** Attackers could use automated scripts to perform numerous login attempts rapidly to try to bypass the bruteforce protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MISP application's login page.
*   **Basic understanding of the application:** Understanding the login form and being able to craft login requests is enough. No specific knowledge of the inner workings of the bruteforce implementation is required.
*   **Automated tooling:** The ability to automate the login process in order to make numerous attempts.

**Details from Commits:**

*   **Commit `c1a0b3b`:**
    *   Modified `app/Model/Bruteforce.php` to use `LOWER(Bruteforce.username)` for case-insensitive username comparison using `trim(strtolower($username))`.

*   **Commit `934c828`:**
    *   Modified `app/Controller/UsersController.php`:
        *   Added `|| $this->request->is('put')` to `if` condition to make sure all post/put requests are checked.
        *   Moved the `Bruteforce->insert` call to inside the `if(isset($this->request->data['User']['email']))` block to only insert failed logins using emails.
    *   Modified `app/Model/Bruteforce.php`:
        *   Added the missing `date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $expire)` format, when inserting a new brute force attempt.
        *   Added trimming on username by using `trim(strtolower($username))` when inserting a failed attempt.
        *  Modified the SQL query in the `clean()` function to use a variable for the time to delete old entries, ensuring consistency and resolving the time differences problem.

In summary, the commits address a weakness in the bruteforce protection mechanism of MISP that could be exploited by attackers to bypass login attempt limitations. The fixes include: making the username comparisons case-insensitive, fixing time inconsistencies, and ensuring that the time format when inserting failed attempts matches that in the database.
