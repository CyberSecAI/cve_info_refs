        "details": {
          "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The `dot-prop` npm package, in versions before 4.2.1 and versions 5.x before 5.1.1, is vulnerable to prototype pollution. This allows an attacker to add arbitrary properties to JavaScript language constructs, such as objects.",
          "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add arbitrary properties to JavaScript language constructs, potentially leading to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other malicious behavior depending on the context of the application using the vulnerable library.",
          "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through network access. The attack complexity is low and no user interaction is required.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any privileges and can trigger the vulnerability remotely."

           "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Prototype pollution due to lack of input sanitization/validation for path components, allowing modification of object prototypes through path manipulation.",
