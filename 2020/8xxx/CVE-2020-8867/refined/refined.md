- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper locking mechanisms when performing operations on an object related to session handling. This leads to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition due to improper locking during session operations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability to create a denial-of-service (DoS) condition against the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, meaning an attacker can be in any position with network access to the vulnerable service.
