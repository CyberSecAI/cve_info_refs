The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pulse Connect Secure, including CVE-2020-8218, and provides detailed technical information about their exploitation.

**CVE-2020-8218**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability in the `downloadlicenses.cgi` file of the admin portal. Specifically, the `$authCode` variable, which is user-controlled, is directly incorporated into a system command.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unsanitized user input: The `authCode` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in a system call, allowing command injection.
    *   Use of system(): The use of the `system()` function without adequate input validation opens the door to command execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the web server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to `downloadlicenses.cgi` with malicious input for the `$authCode` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Requires admin-level authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint.

The document also discusses three other vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2020-8238:**

*   **Root Cause:** Reflected XSS in the `launch.cgi` endpoint. The URL parameter is directly reflected in the HTTP response without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization: The URL parameter is not sanitized or validated before being included in the server's response, making it vulnerable to XSS.
    *   Conditional payload execution: The vulnerability is only triggered when a colon (:) character is present in the URL parameter, due to a check related to web bookmarks.
*  **Impact:** Session hijacking. An attacker can steal the session cookie of an authenticated user.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted URL with a malicious payload within the `url` parameter. The malicious URL is triggered when the user clicks on it, redirecting the browser to an attacker-controlled site and sending the session cookie.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated attacker can trick an authenticated admin into clicking a malicious link.

**CVE-2020-8256:**

*   **Root Cause:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection in the admin dashboard when processing user-supplied teleconference bridge profiles.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization: The XML templates provided by the user are not properly validated for external entities.
    *   Vulnerable XML parser: The parser allows the inclusion of external entities, making it vulnerable to XXE attacks.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file read. An attacker can read files on the remote filesystem.
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious XML template containing an XXE payload and then viewing the template within the admin dashboard.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user access to the admin dashboard.

**XSS through command injection in downloadlicenses.cgi:**

*   **Root Cause:** Reflected XSS in the `downloadlicenses.cgi` endpoint. The server directly outputs URL parameters, which a malicious user can control, on the page when the license code is incorrect.
*    **Weaknesses:**
        *   Lack of output sanitization: URL parameters are directly printed to the output without proper encoding, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking. An attacker can steal the session cookie of an admin.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes javascript code within the `txtVLSAuthCode` parameter and tricking the admin into accessing the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated attacker can trick an authenticated admin into clicking a malicious link.

The document also details how the researchers extracted the source code from the appliance using a memory manipulation technique.
