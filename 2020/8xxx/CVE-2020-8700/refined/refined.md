Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8700:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** within the firmware of certain Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The firmware does not adequately check or sanitize inputs, leading to potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher-level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker must have existing privileged access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text also lists other CVEs related to BIOS firmware vulnerabilities in Intel processors. These include issues like improper initialization, race conditions, insufficient control flow management, out-of-bounds writes/reads, and further improper input validation.
* The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
*   The CVSS vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H indicates:
    *   **AV:L (Local):** Attack vector is local.
    *   **AC:H (High):** Attack complexity is high.
    *   **PR:H (High):** Requires high privileges.
    *   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction required.
    *   **S:C (Changed):** Scope is changed.
    *   **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high.
    *   **I:H (High):** Integrity impact is high.
    *   **A:H (High):** Availability impact is high.
*   The affected products include a wide range of Intel Xeon and Core processors across multiple generations.
*   Intel recommends that users of affected products update to the latest firmware version provided by the system manufacturer.
*   NetApp also acknowledges this vulnerability in their products that incorporate the affected Intel processors and provides patches for some products.

In summary, CVE-2020-8700 is a high-severity vulnerability caused by improper input validation in Intel processor firmware, allowing a privileged local attacker to potentially escalate their privileges.
