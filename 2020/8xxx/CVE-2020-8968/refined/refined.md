- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS) stores user profile passwords in an encrypted file. A local attacker can upload a previously stored cyphered file and retrieve the password in clear text format.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper credentials management. The vulnerability is identified as CWE-255.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the user's information by recovering the profile password in clear text.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where Parallels RAS client is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker, with the ability to upload previously stored encrypted files, can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs low privileges on the local system to retrieve the profile password.
