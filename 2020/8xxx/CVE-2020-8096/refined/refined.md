- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted search path vulnerability. The Bitdefender High-Level Antimalware SDK for Windows loads DLL libraries from the system search path, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate the source of DLL libraries, leading to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can load and execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a required library in a location that is earlier in the search path than the legitimate library. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to write to a directory that is searched before the correct directory containing the legitimate DLL.
