Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Istio's Mixer policy check bypass due to improper handling of the `x-istio-attributes` header. Specifically, the istio-proxy was accepting this header at the ingress, which could then be used to influence policy decisions when the Mixer policy was selectively applied based on the source being the ingress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mixer Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass specifically configured Mixer policies. This means that access control and other policy-based enforcement mechanisms could be circumvented.
*   **Improper Header Handling:** The vulnerability arises from the istio-proxy incorrectly accepting and processing the `x-istio-attributes` header at the ingress. This header was intended for internal use and should not have been accepted from external requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Policy Enforcement Circumvention:** An attacker could manipulate the `x-istio-attributes` header to bypass intended policy checks.
*  **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to resources or services that should have been protected by Mixer policies.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:**  Bypassing policies can allow attackers to potentially access sensitive information or manipulate data, depending on the specifics of the policy and the targeted service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **External Request Manipulation:** The attacker can craft a malicious request containing the `x-istio-attributes` header to an Istio ingress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Istio ingress.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any specific authentication requirements since the header is processed by the istio-proxy before policy checks are applied.
*  **Knowledge of Istio Configuration:** The attacker would need to understand the Istio configuration, specifically how the Mixer policies are configured and applied to the ingress, so they can craft the header correctly. However, this may not always be required if a broad policy can be bypassed with minimal effort.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was silently fixed in Istio 1.4.0 and 1.3.7, after being initially classified as a non-security issue.
*   The `ignore_forwarded_attributes` option was added to the mixer plugin to resolve the issue which could be disabled.
*   The vulnerability affects Istio versions 1.3 to 1.3.6.
*   The vulnerability is related to the telemetry issues at gateways.
