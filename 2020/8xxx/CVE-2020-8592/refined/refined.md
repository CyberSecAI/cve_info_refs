Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8592

**Vulnerable Software:** eG Manager v7.1.2

**Root Cause:** The application has a SQL injection vulnerability within the "Forgot Password" functionality. This is due to missing input validation in the username field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a SQL injection flaw. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to stacked SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can manipulate arbitrary database entries through the SQL injection.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the "eG Manager" server has the `xp_cmdshell` option enabled on MSSQL database, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the underlying operating system. Even without `xp_cmdshell`, RCE may be possible depending on the database used and its capabilities.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Through SQL injection, an attacker can extract database information, including table and column names.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The SQL injection can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*  **Forgot Password Feature:** The attack vector is through the "Forgot Password" functionality of the eG Manager application. Specifically by manipulating the "username" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the eG Manager server.
*  **Basic knowledge of SQL injection** An attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax, specifically the ability to inject stacked SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The blog post shows the exploit process by using a series of requests, demonstrating how SQL injection can be confirmed via boolean based SQL injection, and then how to trigger stacked queries.
*   The blog author used `sqlmap` to demonstrate the extraction of database information, and also demonstrate the ability to get an OS shell via `xp_cmdshell`.
*   The author notes that a successful SQL injection depends on knowing a username in the database, although this could likely be found by leveraging the vulnerability.

**Timeline:**
*   2020/01/23: Vulnerability reported to eG Innovations, Inc.
*   2020/01/28: Vendor addressed the issue in version 7.1.2.
*   2020/01/29: Vendor released the fix to customers.
