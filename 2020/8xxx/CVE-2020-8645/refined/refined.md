Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `job_id` parameter within the `getJobApplicationsByJobId()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `job_id` parameter, passed to `/get_job_applications_ajax.php`, is directly used in an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might modify or delete data within the database.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injected queries could disrupt database operations, leading to service unavailability.
- **Unauthorized access**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP interface at `/get_job_applications_ajax.php`. Attackers can craft malicious payloads in the `job_id` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests to craft malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is present in an unauthenticated part of the application which means the attacker does not need any credentials.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable function is `getJobApplicationsByJobId()` within the file `_lib/class.JobApplication.php`.
- The vulnerability was confirmed on Simplejobscript.com version 1.64 and the report mentions versions up to 1.66 are affected.
- The report includes a PoC payload `job_id=493+AND+(SELECT+9069+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Ufmy)` that demonstrates a time-based SQL injection.
- SQLmap was used for testing the vulnerability.
