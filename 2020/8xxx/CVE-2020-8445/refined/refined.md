Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `OS_CleanMSG` function in `ossec-analysisd` does not properly sanitize log messages. Specifically, it fails to remove or encode terminal control characters and newlines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper sanitization of log messages by `OS_CleanMSG`, which allows control characters and newlines to be included in processed messages.
*   **Control Character Injection:** The vulnerability allows injection of control characters into log messages. This can potentially be used to:
    *  Execute commands when the logs are viewed in vulnerable terminal emulators.
    *  Obfuscate or hide previous log messages, potentially causing administrators to miss critical events.
*   **Newline Injection:** The vulnerability allows injecting newline characters into log messages, which can be used to create nested events in the ossec logs. This can trick administrators into thinking alerts fired when they did not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Execution:** By injecting specific control characters, an attacker might be able to execute commands if the log is viewed using a vulnerable terminal emulator.
*   **Log Obfuscation:** An attacker can manipulate the log output to hide or alter information, leading to missed security events and a false sense of security.
*   **Log Injection:** Injecting newline characters can lead to nested events, causing confusion and potentially masking real events.
*   **Possible unauthenticated remote attack:** For certain types and origins of logged data, this may be an unauthenticated remote attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Agent:** A compromised OSSEC agent can send malicious log messages containing control characters and newlines to the OSSEC server.
*  **Direct Queue Manipulation**: A local attacker with write access to the OSSEC queue can inject malicious log messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised OSSEC Agent:** The attacker needs to have control over an OSSEC agent to send specially crafted log messages. The attacker would need to have a valid agent key.
*   **Local Access (for direct queue manipulation):** An attacker needs local access to write directly to the OSSEC queue if they want to control the full message.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects OSSEC-HIDS versions 2.7 through 3.5.0.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `analysisd` component.
*   The issue was reported by `cpu` on GitHub.
*   A fix has been implemented in later versions of OSSEC.
