## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1821#issue-550427631)

Hi folks,

I spent some free time recently auditing OSSEC. I was primarily focused on a threat model where an OSSEC agent is compromised (e.g. the agent key and assoc. counters are known) and used to attack the OSSEC server (primarily `ossec-remoted` and `ossec-analysisd`). Given the problem domain of OSSEC and HIDS generally I think this is fair game. Since these are post-auth bugs and there isn't guidance on vulnerability disclosure in the README I thought it was acceptable to post information full-disclosure to the repo.

I found a handful of bugs and have done my best to address the root cause, the affected versions, the impact and potential fixes in the issues I've filed. I will request CVEs for the security relevant bugs later on.

In terms of rough risk levels I'd categorize the findings as follows:

Informational:

* os\_regex-empty-pcre2-off-by-one - [os\_regex: OSPcre2\_Compile off-by-one heap overflow compiling empty regex. #1811](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1811) (*Edit: now fixed by [os\_regex: refuse to compile empty PCRE2 pattern. #1826](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1826)*)
* rootcheck-check-rc-if-shell-injection-risk - [rootcheck: risk of shell metachar injection in check-rc-if. #1812](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1812)

Low:

* analysisd-syscheck-decoder-msg-location-path-injection ([CVE-2020-8446](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-96pq-2p2q-gx9m "CVE-2020-8446")) - [CVE-2020-8446: analysisd: syscheck decoder location path injection. #1813](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1813)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-allows-control-chars-in-msg ([CVE-2020-8445](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9vhf-xgg9-m6cf "CVE-2020-8445")) - [CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. #1814](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-bad-location-segfault ([CVE-2020-8448](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vg3-7pxv-7pq6 "CVE-2020-8448")) - [CVE-2020-8448: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG segfault processing invalid msg location. #1815](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1815) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix possible null ptr deref in OS\_CleanMSG. #1823](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1823)*)
* ~~analysisd-syscheck-decoder-off-by-one-read - [syscheck decoder: off-by-one heap overflow in DB operations. #1819](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1819)~~ (*Edit: I made a mistake in my analysis here, it's not a bug*).

Med:

* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-off-by-one-syslog ([CVE-2020-8443](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wpvm-52j3-27mh "CVE-2020-8443")) - [CVE-2020-8443: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG off-by-one heap overflow cleaning syslog msgs. #1816](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1816) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix off-by-one in OS\_CleanMSG. #1824](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1824)*)
* analysisd-OS\_ReadMSG-use-after-free-ossecalert ([CVE-2020-8444](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjcm-4w5p-gw32 "CVE-2020-8444")) - [CVE-2020-8444: analysisd: OS\_ReadMSG heap use-after-free with ossec-alert msgs. #1817](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1817)
* analysisd-OS\_ReadMSG-use-after-free-syscheck ([CVE-2020-8447](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g47q-9m4h-vgjq "CVE-2020-8447")) - [CVE-2020-8447: analysisd: OS\_ReadMSG heap use-after-free decoding syscheck msgs. #1818](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1818)

High:

* analysisd-rootcheck-decoder-heap-overflow ([CVE-2020-8442](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-249h-cc9x-grm3 "CVE-2020-8442")) - [CVE-2020-8442: analysisd rootcheck decoder: heap overflow in DB\_File. #1820](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1820) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix heap overflow in rootkit decoder. #1825](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1825)*)

Some caveats/context to add:

1. I'm not a professional C coder, w.r.t suggested fixes YMMV!
2. I don't write exploits for a living. My assessments of exploitability/risk should be considered lower bounds.
3. This wasn't an extensive audit. I followed my nose and used some fuzzing.
4. OSSEC 2.7 seems to be the earliest tag in the Github repo. I didn't dig deeper into history to see if any of these bugs affect older releases (some likely do).

If you would be interested in trying to adopt fuzzing as part of your CI (or as an integration with oss-fuzz, etc) I'd be happy to try and provide some notes but likely don't have the resources to implement it myself to a merge-able standard of work.

Thanks! You can close this top-level issue as you see appropriate.

# CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. #1814

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814#issue-550426476)

The `ossec-analysisd`'s `OS_CleanMSG` function doesn't remove or encode terminal control characters or newlines from processed log messages. In many cases those control characters/newline are later logged.

There have been cases where allowing arbitrary control characters in log messages has led to command execution with specific terminal emulator implementations. As a result many pieces of software (e.g. [Apache HTTPD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-1862)) have added escaping of control characters in log messages. It may also be possible to abuse terminal control characters to hide previous messages in a log, tricking system administrators into missing events.

Similarly, because newlines (`\n`) are permitted in messages processed by `ossec-analysisd` it may be possible to inject nested events to the ossec log. This may result in system administrators being tricked into thinking alerts fired that did not.

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1813#issue-550426349)

The `ossec-analysisd`'s syscheck decoder (`src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c`) performs unsafe path handling using the received agent name when trying to get the agent file. The `DB_File` function uses the agent name unsanitized when building a file name to be used with `fopen`.

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c#L212-L216)

Lines 212 to 216
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | /\* Get agent file \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | snprintf(sdb.buf, OS\_FLSIZE , "%s/%s", SYSCHECK\_DIR, agent); |
|  |  |
|  | /\* r+ to read and write. Do not truncate \*/ |
|  | sdb.agent\_fps[i] = fopen(sdb.buf, "r+"); |

Processing a syscheck message like `8:a/../../etc/shared/test.txt:aaaaaaa aaaa'` from an agent named `test` sending from localhost results in an `open` for `queue/syscheck/(test) 127.0.0.1->a/../../etc/shared/test.txt`

This will fail with `ENOTDIR` because the part of the path the attacker can't control remotely (`(test) 127.0.0.1->a`) is not a directory. Creating it first by sending a message like `8:a:aaaaaaa aaaa` seems like a potential solution at first but won't work because while the file `queue/syscheck/(test) 127.0.0.1->a` will be created it won't be created as a *directory* but a regular file.

I suspect this means that the bug is only useful to local attackers (that can write directly to the ossec queue). Writing directly to the queue allows full control of the `lf->location` used as the `agent` argument to `fopen` and can cause the syscheck DB file to be created in an attacker controlled location within the `chroot`. Remote attackers can not control the full `lf->location` since the `ossec-remoted` ensures the prefix of agent name and source IP is always present.

Likely the best fix is to use the `w_ref_parent_folder` function from `src/shared/file_op.c` on the location field populated by `OS_CleanMSG` and rejecting any values that have a `1` return from that function.

## Description

In OSSEC-HIDS 2.7 through 3.5.0, the OS\_CleanMSG function in ossec-analysisd doesn't remove or encode terminal control characters or newlines from processed log messages. In many cases, those characters are later logged. Because newlines (\n) are permitted in messages processed by ossec-analysisd, it may be possible to inject nested events into the ossec log. Use of terminal control characters may allow obfuscating events or executing commands when viewed through vulnerable terminal emulators. This may be an unauthenticated remote attack for certain types and origins of logged data.
