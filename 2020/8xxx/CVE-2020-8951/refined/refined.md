Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the "Source" or "Destination" fields of the Configuration Manager within Fiserv Accurate Reconciliation 2.19.0. Specifically, the application failed to properly filter user-supplied input, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a Stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- Inadequate Input Sanitization: The application's filtering mechanisms were bypassed by using capital "R" letters in the payload `<scRipt>onerror=alert\`XSS\`</script>`. This indicates a weakness in the input validation and sanitization process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions like:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the application
   - Data theft
   - Phishing attacks
- Persistent XSS: The injected payload will be executed each time the affected page is accessed, leading to ongoing impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Stored XSS: The attack involves storing the malicious payload within the application's database or configuration settings through the vulnerable input fields.
- Remote Attack: An attacker can exploit this remotely without requiring local access to the server.
- The vulnerable fields are the "Source" and "Destination" fields located in the Configuration Manager (Configuration Parameter Translation) page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to access the Configuration Manager of Fiserv Accurate Reconciliation 2.19.0 application.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable input fields to insert the malicious script.
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned, but the attacker needs to be able to access the Configuration Manager, typically requiring some level of access to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The payload used to bypass filtering was `<scRipt>onerror=alert\`XSS\`</script>`.
- The discovery was credited to Artem Brunov on behalf of TAL Australia.
