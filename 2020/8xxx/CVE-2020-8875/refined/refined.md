- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the IOCTL handler, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute code in the context of the kernel.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user with low privileges.
