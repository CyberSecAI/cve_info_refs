Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two main issues in the ShipStation plugin for CS-Cart version 1.0 within the `shipstation.php` file:
1.  **Incorrect Authentication Logic:** The code at line 36 checks for authentication by verifying if the provided username and password *do not match* the stored credentials. However, it uses a logical AND instead of OR. This means that if *either* the username or password matches, the authentication check will not deny access. This is a logical flaw.

    ```php
    if ($username != $addon_username && $password != $addon_password) {
       die('Access denied - Wrong username or password');
    }
    ```
    
    This should have been:

    ```php
    if ($username != $addon_username || $password != $addon_password) {
       die('Access denied - Wrong username or password');
    }
    ```

2.  **Typo in Registry Key:** A typo exists at line 31 in the code where the password is retrieved from the CS-Cart registry. The key `addons.shipstations.password` is used instead of `addons.shipstation.password`. Because of this typo, the password will always be NULL. When the `NULL` value is compared with the provided password using a non-strict comparison operator (`!=`), an empty string will pass the authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication due to the logical flaw in the access control and a typo leading to `NULL` password retrieval.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access sensitive order and customer information including order details, customer addresses, personal information, and product details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the CS-Cart store's homepage with the following query string parameters:
    -   `dispatch=shipstation`
    -   `action=export`
    -   `start_date=START_DATE_HERE` (any date readable by `strtotime()`)
    -   `end_date=END_DATE_HERE` (any date readable by `strtotime()`)
-   **Empty Password:** An attacker can use a blank password because the comparison between a `NULL` value and an empty string with `!=` evaluates to false in PHP (i.e., the check for `password != NULL` passes if the password is "").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected CS-Cart store.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or knowledge of valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The original vulnerable code was available directly via the ShipStation UI.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.0.10 of the ShipStation plugin, which is now hosted on GitHub.
- The provided example code output is an XML document containing order details, customer information, and product details, demonstrating the information that can be extracted.
