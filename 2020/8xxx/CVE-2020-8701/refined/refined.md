**Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions in the installer for the Intel® SSD Toolbox.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer for the Intel® SSD Toolbox versions before 2/9/2021 had incorrect default permissions, which could allow a privileged user to escalate privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to an escalation of privilege.

**Attack vectors:** Local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user and have local access to the system where the vulnerable Intel® SSD Toolbox is installed. The attacker also needs to trigger a user interaction (UI:R) to complete the escalation.
