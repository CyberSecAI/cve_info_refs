{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to SQL injection that can happen due to missing or insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied input before it's used in SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In some instances this may also lead to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web application input fields",
       "API endpoints",
       "File upload paths"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Access to the web application interface",
      "Ability to inject malicious input",
       "Ability to exploit file upload paths"
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before its incorporation into SQL queries. This allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating specific input fields, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification."
