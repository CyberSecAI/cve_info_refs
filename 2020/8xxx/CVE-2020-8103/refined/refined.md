- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of symbolic links by Bitdefender Antivirus Free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to manipulate symbolic links related to quarantined files. This allows the user to substitute the original quarantined file with a different file, and when the user restores the 'quarantined' file it is restored to a privileged location.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can achieve privilege escalation by substituting a file of their choosing into a privileged location, potentially allowing for code execution or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker needs local access to the machine and the ability to create and manipulate symbolic links and quarantine files via the Antivirus software. The user must also restore a quarantined file after having performed the symbolic link substitution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have low privileges on the system and the ability to interact with the Bitdefender Antivirus Free software to trigger the exploit.
