Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Buffer overflow in a daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a daemon within the firmware of certain Intel Server Boards, Systems and Compute Modules. This occurs when a daemon receives more data than its buffer can hold, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected system.
- **Information Disclosure**: While not explicitly stated, buffer overflows can sometimes lead to unintended disclosure of sensitive information present in the memory around the overflow.
- **Denial of Service:** The impact is also listed as partial impact to integrity. However, the CVSS score shows that there is no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent Access: The vulnerability is exploitable via adjacent network access. This means the attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable system, or have some other way of sending network packets to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access**: An attacker does not need any prior authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Adjacent Network Access**: The attacker must have a network connection to the vulnerable system.
- **Firmware Version**: The target system must be using a vulnerable firmware version prior to 1.59.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Dmytro Oleksiuk.
- Intel has released firmware updates to mitigate the vulnerability.
- NetApp has also acknowledged the vulnerability in their products, specifically NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage products, but has no plans to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.7 (Medium) with the vector: AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
