Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path within the installer of the Intel® RSTe Software RAID Driver. This means the installer may look in predictable locations for required files, and if an attacker can place malicious files in these locations they can be executed with elevated privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is the lack of proper control over the search paths used by the installer. This allows for a potential path traversal or path injection attack during the installation process.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to achieve an escalation of privilege. This means a user with limited access to the system could potentially gain administrative level access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker must have some form of access to the system where the vulnerable driver is being installed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system and be able to place malicious files in the search path that is used by the installer. Additionally, the attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable installation procedure to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is required.

**Summary:**
The document describes a vulnerability (CVE-2020-8687) in the Intel® RSTe Software RAID Driver installer where an uncontrolled search path can be exploited by a local, authenticated user with user interaction to achieve privilege escalation. The fix is to update to version 4.7.0.1119 or later.
