Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8436:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the RegistrationMagic plugin, specifically version 4.6.0.0. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into form fields and URL parameters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into form fields (like the "Name" field in a contact form) and stored in the database. When an administrator views the submissions, the injected code executes in their browser.
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript can be injected through URL parameters (e.g., `rm_form_id`, `form_name`, `Textarea_`, `TextBox_`) and executed in the administrator's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability could lead to an attacker stealing an administrator's session tokens, potentially gaining complete control of the WordPress site.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could use the XSS to perform actions as the administrator, including but not limited to: modifying site content, creating new admin accounts, installing malicious plugins, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Form Submissions:** Attackers can submit malicious scripts through the front-end forms created by the plugin.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with injected scripts in parameters and entice administrators to click them.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For stored XSS: The attacker needs to be able to submit data to a form generated by the RegistrationMagic plugin.
    *   For reflected XSS: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator into clicking on it.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content highlights vulnerable code snippets, specifically a javascript function that takes form id values from a dropdown and reloads the page. However, the value is not sanitized or validated, thus an attacker can manipulate it with malicious values that get reflected in the application.
```javascript
function rm_refresh_stats(){
var form_id = jQuery('#rm_form_dropdown').val();
var trange = jQuery('#rm_stat_timerange').val();
if(typeof trange == 'undefined')
trange = ;
window.location = '?page=rm_analytics_show_form&rm_form_id=' + form_id + '&rm_tr='+trange;
```

**Remediation:**
The vulnerability was patched in a later version of the plugin. Users are advised to update to the latest version of Registration Magic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions a related SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-8435), but this is not the focus of this analysis.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Spider Sec Ltd during a penetration test and reported on their blog.
