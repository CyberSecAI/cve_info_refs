## Description

#### WordPress User Registration Forms Plugin

Create custom WordPress registration forms, publish signup and login pages, enable user registrations, approve new users, accept payments, track submissions, manage users, analyze registration data, assign user roles, apply registration status, send bulk emails, automate registration process, launch event registration, integrate WooCommerce, and much more. If you are looking for a powerful WordPress user registration plugin and custom registration form builder, look no further than RegistrationMagic!

#### So, what exactly is RegistrationMagic?

[RegistrationMagic](https://registrationmagic.com) will let you take TOTAL CONTROL of user registrations on your site, with its powerful building, configuring, publishing, managing, analyzing and automation toolkit. You can create different WordPress Registration Forms for your users with pre-defined form fields using an intuitive drag-and-drop form builder. Choose from ready-to-use forms library to quickly create your forms with a few simple clicks! You can also set up payments for [paid user registrations](https://registrationmagic.com/setup-payments-on-registrationmagic-form-using-products/) and build any type of WordPress payment form. [A Front-End user registration area](https://registrationmagic.com/how-create-custom-user-area-page-in-wordpress/) allows your users to login, reset password, check payment transaction history, download their form submissions, etc.

[Get started with RegistrationMagic using our Starter Guide.](https://registrationmagic.com/create-wordpress-registration-page-starter-guide/)

RegistrationMagic tracks all incoming registration form submissions and activities, which can be monitored from individual form dashboard, allowing you to make informed decisions about your form tweaks. You can also accept attachments (single or multiple), and view or download them from a single area inside the dashboard. Advanced filters allow you to track form submissions for a specific registration form within a time period.

There is also a full-fledged [User Management module](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-management-plugin-guide/) integrated with RegistrationMagic. It goes a step ahead of default WordPress User manager by connecting user registration and payment activities with individual user accounts. User Manager is the central hub for RegistrationMagic’s user management system, which provides important information about each user within individual user pages. User management also offers enhanced options like suspending and re-activating users.

RegistrationMagic not only allows you to create [new user roles](https://registrationmagic.com/register-users-specific-role-wordpress-site/) but integrate them with your login and registration system easily. You can even create paid user roles using in-built manager!

Full integration with WordPress’ default user-meta system means you can hook your registration fields with existing user-meta keys, or create new ones right from the comfort of your registration form dashboard. Therefore, not only all registration form submissions are visible inside WordPress User pages as table, you can also go ahead and map individual registration form fields to user profile fields (or create new ones from scratch)! This also opens a world of opportunity for integrations with other plugins using WP user-meta.

[Learn more about RegistrationMagic features here.](https://registrationmagic.com/features/)

Not happy with default WordPress registration page? You can define and replace default WordPress registration page with your own custom-built registration form. RegistrationMagic provides you with more control and flexibility over your WordPress registration page. It redefined the user experience by combining specialized roles of both login and registration plugin.

With RegistrationMagic you can build anything from simple to complex [registration approval system](https://registrationmagic.com/manual-approval-of-registered-users/) to enable or disable user registration. Powerful Custom Status feature offers an option to create multi-step registration approval process. [Automations](https://registrationmagic.com/complete-automation-guide-wordpress-forms/) can be used for [automated registration approval](https://registrationmagic.com/automate-wordpress-user-account-activation-deactivation-deletion/) mechanism. These features allow you to use RegistrationMagic for industry specific registration systems, like [WordPress event registration plugin](https://registrationmagic.com/event-registration-form-plugin/) for online or physical events, member registration plugin for teams, WordPress application form plugin for businesses and WordPress enrollment plugin for sport camps. If you are [registering with limited seats](https://registrationmagic.com/restrict-limit-user-registration-wordpress/), the Limits feature can help you build WordPress event registration form, which has both a booking time window and option to limit the number of bookings. You can also [generate token numbers](https://registrationmagic.com/assign-unique-registration-token-number-to-user/) for every booking for these event registration forms. Another example would be to use it as [WordPress course registration plugin](https://registrationmagic.com/best-wordpress-class-registration-plugin/) for classes.

[Custom Status Guide](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-registration-status-guide/): The Custom Registration Status system allows combining multiple actions in a single click. (Just like your very own macros!) This enables you to move submissions through a vetting process. Every action can prompt user to fulfill certain requirements. With advance Inbox filters and saved searches, It’s a cinch to sort and mark submissions. Failed registration attempts can be routed through different registration setup.

#### Frontend

Customer journey on your site starts with the sign-up process. There are multiple configuration settings in RegistrationMagic to curate sign-up experience for your users. These include different types of limits along with granular access controls, offering them to select user roles, display and [hide signup form fields using preset conditions](https://registrationmagic.com/add-conditions-to-fields-in-wordpress-form/), etc. You also have complete control over [redirections after sign-up](https://registrationmagic.com/redirect-user-to-specific-page-after-form-submission/), sending users email updates and even add automation to take care of recurring tasks.

#### The Login System

[Read our WordPress User Login Guide](https://registrationmagic.com/wordpress-user-login-plugin-guide/): The Login Form Dashboard is much more capable and scalable system. You can now edit both Username and Password fields including custom errors and labels. You get a multi-level login validation process that uses reCAPTCHA, IP Filters (Premium) and Two-Factor Authentication (Premium). As with other forms, you can tweak visual elements of the login form. We have included four new custom email templates attached to login events. We have further introduced a new, multipurpose Login Logout button Widget. It renders Login Logout buttons based on user login state, displays login form as a pop-up or page, and important information about the current user on cursor hovering. We have moved all external integration services specific to login under a single section and added Login Analytics with user login timeline under it. Login Timeline also features advance filtering. A new Login tab now appears on user pages inside User Manager, with a chronological list of login events specific to the user.

#### Payment Forms

With RegistrationMagic you can build PayPal forms, Stripe forms, registration forms with payment and more!

## FAQ

### Q: I am seeing following error message when visiting the registration form: “Submission limit reached for this form, please try back after 24 hours”

Ans: This is an anti-spam measure built into RegistrationMagic. A registration form can be submitted only certain number of times from a given device within a period of 24 hours. You can define the limit from Global Settings → Security. Change the value of Form Submission Limit for a Device as required. Set the limit to zero in order to disable the feature altogether, i.e. allow unlimited submissions from a device.

Note that in RegistrationMagic Premium, a global override is also available for this setting in Form Settings → Global Overrides.

### Q: “Access Denied” error when trying to view registration form?

Ans: Please make sure that you haven’t accidentally blocked your own IP address! Confirm it from Global Settings → Security → Banned IP addresses from accessing the form.

Also make sure that you are using latest version of RegistrationMagic, as this issue may arise from IPv6 connections, which were addressed in latest versions.

### Q: Submit button not working/does nothing!

Ans: Most of the time this happens due to a javascript error from a third-party plugin or theme. You will need to check browser console and see if there are any errors pointing to a file outside of RegistrationMagic repository. If you are able to trace it to a plugin, try disabling it and reload the registration form.

Another reason can be minification of JS files and inline scripts. Disable these if you are using a plugin for minification and try again.

### Q: Form reloads on submitting and all fields are emptied!

Ans: This may happen if you are using a caching plugin. RegistrationMagic form is a dynamic entity and many features such as analytics may not work properly if the form is served from a cached copy. You will need to exclude the form page from caching inside your cache plugin’s configuration. After, that Purge the cache and try again.

### Q: How do I change the text on the “submit” button?

Ans: You can easily do it from Form Settings → Design. Once inside, click on the animating circle on the submit button. A panel will show up where you can change the button label along with color and numerous other attributes.

### Q: I want to translate some text, how can I do it?

Ans: RegistrationMagic uses standard WordPress po/mo files for maintaining translations. You can use any po editor to translate. We recommend Loco Translate, since it is a free WordPress plugin and works directly from admin dashboard. [Click here to get it](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/)

As a nice little trick you can even modify texts using this, for example label of username and password fields.

### Q: Can I create early bird user registration forms with it?

Ans: RegistrationMagic allows you to set limits to your registration forms and render a different registration form once the limit has reached. Limit can be based on number of form submissions or a set date. To create early bird form system, you need to create two different forms – One for Early Bird user registration and the other one for regular user registration. Obviously, you can set different prices for them. After that, set limit on the early bird form by going to Form Card → Settings → Limits. Turn on ‘Auto Expires’, then define its limits. Below the limits, there’s an option ‘Post Expiry Action’. Select Display another form. A new drop down will appear below it. Choose your regular user registration form. Now go ahead and publish your early bird form and RegistrationMagic will take care of the rest 🙂

In fact you can daisy chain multiple forms like this to create a system of forms! It opens up a host of new possibilities.

### Q: Can an already registered user resubmit a user registration form?

Ans: RegistrationMagic allows resubmission of user registration forms. Therefore it is possible for users on your site to register multiple times if you offer different user registration options.

### Q: Can I create WordPress registration form with payment field?

Ans: Yes, you can create user registration WordPress form with payment option, which allows user registration only after payment has been received successfully. If payment is unsuccessful, user account will not be activated.

### Q: Can I use PayPal with RegistrationMagic?

Ans: Yes, RegistrationMagic is a powerful WordPress PayPal payment plugin which allows adding multiple payment fields with configurable options in your forms.

### Q: Can I use Stripe with RegistrationMagic?

Ans: Yes, Stripe integration is available in RegistrationMagic. Using pricing fields, you can create stripe checkout WordPress pages.

### Q: Can I use RegistrationMagic for registering users for events?

Ans: RegistrationMagic offers general purpose user registration systems with multiple tools. It allows you to create virtually any type of user registration process. Therefore, it is possible to use RegistrationMagic for registering users for an event.

If you want more specialized event registration options like event bookings, be sure to try out our other plugin [EventPrime](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eventprime-event-calendar-management/). It integrates with RegistrationMagic to display RegistrationMagic’s user registration forms when users book tickets for an event.

### Q: Can I subscribe users to my newsletter list, while they register?

Ans: RegistrationMagic integrates with two of the most popular newsletter plugins on WordPress – [MailPoet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wysija-newsletters/) and [Newsletter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newsletter/). You can use anyone of them to subscribe users when they register through a RegistrationMagic form. Note, this functionality is limited to Premium version of RegistrationMagic.

### Q: How can RegistrationMagic enhance my WooCommerce online shop?

Ans: RegistrationMagic combines with WooCommerce to add awesome new features to your ecommerce site. You can use a RegistrationMagic form as default user registration form when users register for your shop. It also displays during guest checkout process.

# Registration Magic Multiple Unauthenticated XSS Vulnerabilities (Version 4.6.0.0)

By [Spider Sec](https://spider-security.co.uk/author/spider-sec/)[January 30, 2020September 9, 2024](https://spider-security.co.uk/vulnerability-discovery/blog-cve-2020-8436/)[Vulnerability Discovery](https://spider-security.co.uk/category/vulnerability-discovery/)
# Registration Magic Version 4.6.0.0 (Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities)

---

### Background

After discovering two new WordPress Plugin vulnerabilities on a recent [web application penetration test](https://spider-security.co.uk/web-application-penetration-testing) (which were authenticated and difficult to weaponise) I decided to go in search for some higher ticket WordPress Plugin vulnerabilities in my spare time. I started downloading registration form and forum building plugins, as these are more likely to contain unauthenticated or customer-facing vulnerabilities.

Introducing [RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms and User Login](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/#developers) version 4.6.0.0 a form building plugin which allows users to create custom login forms, contact forms and other form-based software ideas. However, the vulnerability in the discussion above would need authentication as an administrator to be useful. I had a feeling that a more useful bug could be found in this plugin so started building forms and adding them into my lab.

---

### Technical Details

#### Unauthenticated Stored (XSS) on Contact Form

Here you can see the XSS being injected into the Name field of a contact form generated by Registration Magic.

![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Submit-e1580334015676.png)

Next, we go to the contact form and select to view the submissions.

![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/clik1.png)
![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/evidence.png)

Uh Oh…..so an unauthenticated user can make a submission into one of these generated contact forms and run code inside the administrators’ browser and potentially steal session tokens. Anyone running this plugin could easily lose access to their site.

![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Exploit.png)

---

#### Reflected XSS on Multiple Parameters

Next, we have more XSS vulnerabilities which were discovered during fuzzing.

```
 http://192.168.0.34/rm_submissions/?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%27Vulnerable%20XSS%27)%3C%2fscript%3Exolca=1
```

![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/VUlnxss.png)

```
http://192.168.0.31/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rm_form_sett_manage&rm_form_id=607h4knr%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3edsukr
```

![](https://spider-security.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/formTRreflected.png)

The following parameters were also affected by XSS inside the application.

```
 rm_form_id, form_name,Textarea_, TextBox_
```

---

#### Code Breakdown

Plenty of places in the code parameter values are being taken by the application without proper validation checks. I am going to outline a few examples now.

Here we can see in the comments “take value from various variables and reload pages with those updated”, but there is no validation controls and using an interceptor such as burp we can modify the rm\_form\_id content in the dropdown.

```
//Takes value of various status variables (form_id, timeline_range) and reloads page with those parameteres updated.
function rm_refresh_stats(){
var form_id = jQuery('#rm_form_dropdown').val();
var trange = jQuery('#rm_stat_timerange').val();
if(typeof trange == 'undefined')
trange = ;
window.location = '?page=rm_analytics_show_form&rm_form_id=' + form_id + '&rm_tr='+trange;

```

Here we can see the form\_id is being grabbed which is later echo’d into the application browser

```
$form_id= $_GET['form_id']
```
### Remediation

Update to the latest version of Registration Magic.
