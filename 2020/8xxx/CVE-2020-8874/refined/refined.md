Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8874:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the xHCI component of Parallels Desktop. This lack of validation leads to an integer overflow when allocating a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow.
- Improper validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the hypervisor.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker must have local access to the guest system.
- Requires high-privilege code execution: The attacker needs the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system *before* exploiting the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the guest system.
- Ability to execute high-privileged code on the guest system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Parallels Desktop version 15.1.3 (47255).
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-02-21, and the advisory was publicly released on 2020-03-13.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
