Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8841:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `reqSearch.php` file of Testlink version 1.9.19. It is triggered through the `relation_type` parameter within a POST request. This parameter is not properly sanitized, which allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection and a time-based blind SQL injection. This is due to the lack of input sanitization of the `relation_type` parameter in the `reqSearch.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the application's database.
* **Data exfiltration:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, application configurations, and other confidential information.
* **Data manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data from the database, potentially leading to data corruption, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request targeting the `/testlink/lib/requirements/reqSearch.php` endpoint.
* **`relation_type` parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `relation_type` which is included in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected Testlink server.
* **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `relation_type` parameter in `reqSearch.php`
* **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit information suggests that this vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication. (guest user)
