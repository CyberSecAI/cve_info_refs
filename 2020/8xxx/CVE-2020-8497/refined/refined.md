- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The webchat history file (`pandora_chat.log.json.txt`) is accessible without authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of access control on the chat history file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can read the chat history, which contains usernames, user IDs, private messages, and timestamps.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the chat history file via a direct URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable Pandora FMS instance.
