Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8831:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Apport creates a lock file. It attempts to create the directory `/var/lock/apport` and a lock file within it. Because `/var/lock` is world-writable, a malicious user can create a symbolic link at `/var/lock/apport` pointing to another location. This leads to the lock file being created in a user-controlled location with insecure permissions (world writable and owned by root).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Lock File Creation:** Apport creates a lock file in a user-controlled location, specifically `/var/lock/apport/lock`, when `/var/lock/apport` is a symlink.
2.  **World Writable Permissions:** The lock file is created with mode 0777, making it world-writable.
3.  **Root Ownership:** The lock file is owned by the root user.
4.  **TOCTTOU vulnerability** The race condition exists between the `os.open` and `os.chown` calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the location of the lock file, an attacker could potentially overwrite or create files in sensitive directories (e.g., cron directories, other configuration file locations, etc.), allowing them to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** The attacker could modify the content of files they otherwise wouldn't have access to, potentially disrupting the system or gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The attacker creates a symbolic link named `/var/lock/apport` pointing to a location of their choice.
2.  **Apport Execution:** When Apport runs, it follows this symbolic link, leading to the lock file being created in an attacker controlled location.
3.  **File Overwrite:** The attacker can then manipulate the world writable file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **File System Write Access to /var/lock:** They need to be able to create symbolic links within the `/var/lock` directory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Apport versions prior to the fix.
*   The fix involved moving the lock file creation to `/var/run/apport.lock` and setting the file mode to 0o600, which restricts access to the root user.
*   The issue was addressed in conjunction with CVE-2020-8833.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The primary issue was the insecure creation of a lock file in a user-controllable location with overly permissive permissions, which could be exploited to gain privilege escalation.
