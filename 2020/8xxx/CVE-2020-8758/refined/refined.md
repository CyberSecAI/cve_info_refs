Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-8758:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `intel.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2020-8758`, and its description aligns with the vulnerability description from `us-cert.cisa.gov`. This confirms that the information is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is "Improper buffer restrictions in the network subsystem" of Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper buffer restrictions:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper buffer boundary checks within the network subsystem of Intel AMT and ISM.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation can lead to an unauthenticated user gaining elevated privileges via network access. On un-provisioned systems, an authenticated user can achieve this via local access.
*   **Information disclosure**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through network access on provisioned systems.
*    **Local Access:** On un-provisioned systems, an authenticated user can exploit the vulnerability through local access.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **For provisioned systems**: An unauthenticated attacker needs network access to the target system.
*   **For un-provisioned systems**: An attacker requires local access to the target system and valid user credentials.

**7. Additional Details from the Documents:**

*   **Affected Products (from intel.com):** Intel AMT and Intel ISM versions before 11.8.79, 11.12.79, 11.22.79, 12.0.68 and 14.0.39.
*   **Affected Products (from security.netapp.com):** NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage.
*   **NetApp Products Not Affected (from security.netapp.com):** A very large number of NetApp products are listed as NOT affected.  
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical) for remote, unauthenticated exploitation. 7.8 for local, authenticated exploitation.
*   **Mitigations (from us-cert.cisa.gov & intel.com):**
    *   Update Intel AMT and ISM to the latest versions provided by system manufacturers.
    *   Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
    *   Isolate control system networks from business networks.
    *   Use secure remote access methods (VPNs).
    *   Treck recommends implementing firewall rules to filter out packets with negative content length in the HTTP header (related to a different CVE, but mentioned in the advisory).
*   **Reporting Sources:** Intel identified the vulnerability internally. Arie Haenel, Ofek Mostovoy, Yaakov Cohen, Yocheved Butterman, and Yossef Kuszer from Intel reported the vulnerabilities to Treck.
*   **Public Discussion:**  NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
*    **NetApp Remediation:** NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore are not planning on addressing the vulnerability. The affected products have been declared as "Won't Fix".
*   **Other names for affected TCP/IP stack:** Kasago TCP/IP, ELMIC, Net+ OS, Quadnet, GHNET v2, Kwiknet, or AMX
*    **Note**: Firmware versions of Intel® ME 3.x thru 10.x, Intel® TXE 1.x thru 2.x, and Intel® Server Platform Services 1.x thru 2.X are no longer supported versions. There is no new general release planned for these versions.
