Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8603

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling logged URLs within the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance. This lack of validation allows for the injection of arbitrary scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote attackers can tamper with the web interface of the affected appliance.
*   Attackers can inject arbitrary scripts.
*   This vulnerability, if chained with other vulnerabilities, can potentially lead to code execution in the context of root.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user interacts with the injected malicious script, requiring the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to craft and inject a malicious script within a logged URL.
*   The attacker needs to induce a user of the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing the crafted URL in order for the XSS to be triggered.

**Additional Details**
*   The specific flaw exists within the handling of logged URLs.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-01-17.
*   A coordinated public release of the advisory was made on 2020-05-27.
