### @mtrmac **[mtrmac](/mtrmac)** commented [Jan 10, 2020](#issue-548188804) • edited Loading

For some time, we’ve been struggling with more or less occasional memory corruption, e.g. when running the tests of github.com/containers/image/signature

```
GO111MODULE="on" go test -c ./signature/
for i in $(seq 1 10000); do
    echo =====$i
    (cd signature; GOTRACEBACK=crash GODEBUG=clobberfree=1,cgocheck=2 ../signature.test) || break
done
```

eventually crashes on most platforms.

---

Thanks to Ulrich Obergfell uobergfe@redhat.com, we now have a strong candidate for the cause:

As far as Go is concerned, Data.dh and Data.cbc are just values, so it is OK to implement

```
cgo_call(d.dh)
```

as

```
tmp := d.dh
dropReferenceTo(d)
// d's finalizer can be called at any point from now on, possibly deallocating d.dh
cgo_call(tmp) // possibly using free memory
```

To fix this, explicitly extend the lifetime of Data:

```
cgo_call(d.dh)
runtime.KeepAlive(d)
```

becomes

```
tmp := d.dh
cgo_call(tmp) // d.dh is certainly still valid
dropReferenceTo(d)
// d's finalizer can be called from now on, possibly deallocating d.dh
```

and the like.

---

This PR implements that throughout the codebase; see the individual commit messages for details.

I’m filing this PR for ~early review, I’ll run a stress-test to validate the fixes (at least on the code paths relevant to us) over the weekend.

Sorry, something went wrong.

To be extra careful, this adds runtime.KeepAlive calls even in cases where the current
code path necessarily keeps c alive afterwards, so that the patern is clear and so
that future possible changes to the code don't invalidate this assumption.

Secondarily, in a few cases GPGMe returns internal pointers inside Context.ctx;
in that case, extend the lifetime of Context until we make a complete copy of
the data.

As a special case, EngineInfo is now not just a wrapper around a C pointer with
an unknown lifetime, but we make a full copy of the data when obtaining the pointer
so that we can safely use it after dropping the context that returned the information,
or after changing the information and possibly invalidating the pointers.

| A more explicit demonstration:  ``` package main  import ( 	"fmt" 	"math/rand" 	"runtime" )  type pointerBinding struct { 	managed uint64 }  func newPointerBinding() *pointerBinding { 	ptr := &pointerBinding{} 	runtime.SetFinalizer(ptr, (*pointerBinding).Finalizer) 	ptr.managed = rand.Uint64() // Could come from CGo 	fmt.Printf("Created %p, managed value %v\n", ptr, ptr.managed) 	return ptr }  func (ptr *pointerBinding) Finalizer() { 	fmt.Printf("Finalizing %p, managed value %v\n", ptr, ptr.managed) 	// Free ptr.managed via CGo 	ptr.managed = 0 }  func (ptr *pointerBinding) functionBinding() { 	fmt.Printf("Calling function for %p, managed value %v\n", ptr, ptr.managed) 	underlyingFunction(ptr.managed) 	fmt.Printf("Done\n") // No reference to ptr here, or the behavior would change 	// HERE runtime.KeepAlive(ptr) }  func underlyingFunction(pointer uint64) { 	runtime.GC() 	fmt.Printf("Underlying function, managed value %v\n", pointer) }  func main() { 	ptr := newPointerBinding() 	ptr.functionBinding() 	runtime.GC() } ```  As is:  ``` $ GOTRACEBACK=crash GODEBUG=clobberfree=1,cgocheck=2 go run ./standalone.go  Created 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 Calling function for 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 Finalizing 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 Underlying function, managed value 5577006791947779410 Done ```  note that “Finalizing” happens *before* “Underlying function” is done with the managed value.  Uncommenting the `runtime.KeepAlive` at “HERE”:  ``` $ GOTRACEBACK=crash GODEBUG=clobberfree=1,cgocheck=2 go run ./standalone.go  Created 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 Calling function for 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 Underlying function, managed value 5577006791947779410 Done Finalizing 0xc000014080, managed value 5577006791947779410 ```  works as expected. (Without the GO\* variables, the finalizer is actually never run, but that’s fine for our purposes as well.) |

I have encountered no crashes during a 3-day test run of the tests mentioned above; before this PR the tests would crash in 1–4 iterations on macOS, and in <2 thousand iterations on Linux; now it survived 1053 iterations on macOS, and 160931 iterations on Linux.  (The different number of iterations is caused by the Linux build of GPG having <https://dev.gnupg.org/T3380> applied.) |

Thanks so much for the PR [@mtrmac](https://github.com/mtrmac) - that must have been an inordinate amount of effort 💚

If I knew this would have been the result I definitely would not have used finalisers. In fact I'm wondering if it would be better to remove them, better safe than sorry?

| If I knew this would have been the result I definitely would not have used finalisers. In fact I'm wondering if it would be better to remove them, better safe than sorry?  In general, I think it’s nice for the Go bindings to do the work to make the API Go-like, including Go assumptions like no need to worry about memory references/lifetimes.  The code in containers/image that calls these bindings apparently relies on the finalizers, there are no explicit `Close`/`Release` calls (I’m actually rather surprised at this… I don’t know why I never thought to look for them or call them, my best guess guess because the `Context`/`Data` objects are in-memory-only), and the containers/image library is used in long-term daemons. So, at least for this code, removing finalizers now would lead to undesirable memory leaks unless the callers were adjusted.  That does not necessarily mean that other consumers are the same, but it’s a possibility, and nothing in the documentation comments suggests the need to call the `Close`/`Release` methods. |

This fixes CVE-2020-8945 by incorporating
https://github.com/proglottis/gpgme/pull/23 .

Other changes included by the rebase:
- Support for gpgme_off_t (~no-op with the RHEL 7 GPGME 1.3.2)
- Wrapping a few more GPGME functions (irrelevant if we don't call them)
- Better error reporting in Context.GetKey

Given how invasive the CVE fix is (affecting basically all binding
code), it seems safer to just update the package (and be verifiably
equivalent with upstream) than to backport and try to back out the few
other changes.

This "fixes" [CVE-2020-8945](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m6wg-2mwg-4rfq "CVE-2020-8945") by incorporating [proglottis/gpgme#23](https://github.com/proglottis/gpgme/pull/23) .

The code is not actually used, for two reasons:
- Nothing in this repository invokes signature verification
  (the subpackage is only used to generate contents of policy.json)
- Builds use the 'containers_image_openpgp' build tag, which
  switches to the non-gpgme signature backend.

This updates the vendored code anyway
- to avoid false positives when scanning for vulnerabilities
- so that we don't have to worry about any future changes in this
  repository enabling those code paths.

Performed by updating Gopgg.tompl and
$ dep ensure

1. [Ensure Data is not dellocated while C code is still using it](/proglottis/gpgme/commit/d43d199046c30db9bef90de20c09843bb8b45737)
    …

   ```
   As far as Go is concerned, Data.dh and Data.cbc are just values, so it is
   OK to implement
   > cgo_call(d.dh)
   as
   > tmp := d.dh
   > dropReferenceTo(d)
   > // d's finalizer can be called at any point from now on, possibly deallocating d.dh
   > cgo_call(tmp) // possibly using free memory

   To fix this, explicitly extend the lifetime of Data:
   > cgo_call(d.dh)
   > runtime.KeepAlive(d)
   becomes
   > tmp := d.dh
   > cgo_call(tmp) // d.dh is certainly still valid
   > dropReferenceTo(d)
   > // d's finalizer can be called from now on, possibly deallocating d.dh

2. [Ensure Context is not dellocated while C code is still using it](/proglottis/gpgme/commit/7e8c79da5ec1bd810f01f46df83a8a914e49f4fa)
    …

   ```
   As far as Go is concerned, Context.ctx and Context.cbc are just values, so it is
   OK to implement
   > cgo_call(c.ctx)
   as
   > tmp := c.ctx
   > dropReferenceTo(c)
   > // c's finalizer can be called at any point from now on, possibly deallocating c.ctx
   > cgo_call(tmp) // possibly using free memory

   To fix this, explicitly extend the lifetime of Context:
   > cgo_call(c.ctx)
   > runtime.KeepAlive(c)
   becomes
   > tmp := c.ctx
   > cgo_call(tmp) // c.ctx is certainly still valid
   > dropReferenceTo(c)
   > // c's finalizer can be called from now on, possibly deallocating c.ctx

   To be extra careful, this adds runtime.KeepAlive calls even in cases where the current
   code path necessarily keeps c alive afterwards, so that the patern is clear and so
   that future possible changes to the code don't invalidate this assumption.

   Secondarily, in a few cases GPGMe returns internal pointers inside Context.ctx;
   in that case, extend the lifetime of Context until we make a complete copy of
   the data.

   As a special case, EngineInfo is now not just a wrapper around a C pointer with
   an unknown lifetime, but we make a full copy of the data when obtaining the pointer
   so that we can safely use it after dropping the context that returned the information,
   or after changing the information and possibly invalidating the pointers.

    …

   ```
   As far as Go is concerned, Key.k is just a value, so it is

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-ccc3e64ea5
2020-03-09 20:54:26.535450
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : podman
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.8.0
Release : 4.fc30
URL : <https://podman.io/>
Summary : Manage Pods, Containers and Container Images
Description :
podman (Pod Manager) is a fully featured container engine that is a simple
daemonless tool. podman provides a Docker-CLI comparable command line that
eases the transition from other container engines and allows the management of
pods, containers and images. Simply put: alias docker=podman.
Most podman commands can be run as a regular user, without requiring
additional privileges.

podman uses Buildah(1) internally to create container images.
Both tools share image (not container) storage, hence each can use or
manipulate images (but not containers) created by the other.

Manage Pods, Containers and Container Images
libpod Simple management tool for pods, containers and images

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

The Go wrapper is used during the interaction of container images and GPG signatures; for example when pulling an image from a registry and verifying it's signature.  The gpgme Go wrapper however does not mark the data structures or pointers to be kept alive by the Go run time. During the execution of the gpg binary, it is possible for the Golang garbage collector to free the referenced C structures whilst it is still required.   When the gpg binary finishes executing, the gpgme C library is now using/referencing released memory - resulting in a use-after-free scenario.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1795838#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-10 12:22:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2  Via RHSA-2020:0689 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0689](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0689)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1795838#c31)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-10 16:31:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
