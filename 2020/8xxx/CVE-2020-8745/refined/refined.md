Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-8745:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient control flow management in the Intel CSME (Converged Security and Management Engine) and TXE (Trusted Execution Engine) subsystems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper control flow management allows for potential privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Escalation of privileges, allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access or control over the system.
*   Potential for information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service as mentioned in the NetApp advisories.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical access:** The Siemens advisory specifies that an attacker needs physical access to exploit this vulnerability. The NetApp advisory indicates the attack vector as "physical".
*  **Local Access:** The Siemens advisory mentions "an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems," suggesting a requirement for local access in addition to physical access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated user:** The Siemens advisory states that an "unauthenticated user" can potentially exploit the vulnerability. The NetApp document indicates that no privileges are required.
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the vulnerable system. The CVSS vector for this vulnerability is "AV:P".
*  **Ability to run untrusted code:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the targeted system.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific versions of Intel CSME and TXE.
*   NetApp indicates that the fix for this issue will not be implemented for NetApp Cloud Backup.
*   Siemens provides a list of affected products, including various SIMATIC IPC and SINUMERIK devices, along with specific BIOS versions that need to be updated to mitigate the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-8745 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that arises from insufficient control flow management within Intel CSME/TXE. It requires an attacker to have physical access to the target device and potentially the ability to execute untrusted code. Successful exploitation could lead to elevated privileges on the system, information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service.
