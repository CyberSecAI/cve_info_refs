Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a relative path traversal issue within the Gurux GXDLMS Director software during the download of OBIS (Object Identification System) code files. The application does not properly validate the paths specified in the downloaded XML file, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths using relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal**: The application fails to sanitize or validate file paths when downloading OBIS codes, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory structure using sequences like `../`.
- **Lack of input validation**: The program does not check if the downloaded files are actually valid OBIS codes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file write:** By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system. This can be used to:
    - Place executable files in autorun directories, achieving code execution upon system reboot.
    - Place malicious DLL files within the GXDLMS Director installation directory, leading to code execution the next time the application is launched.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Ultimately, the attacker can achieve remote code execution by strategically placing malicious code (executables or DLLs) on the victim's machine using the path traversal vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the application and the update server (gurux.fi) by setting up a malicious Wi-Fi network or by compromising the network.
- **Malicious update server:** The attacker can control the update server or modify its content.
- **Modification of update XML:** The attacker modifies `gurux.fi/obis/files.xml` to point to their own server and include the relative path traversal in the file path of the `file` element of `files.xml`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the user and the update server to intercept and modify communications, for example by running a malicious wifi hotspot.
- **Ability to serve HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to host files on an HTTP server that is accessible by the application.
- **Knowledge of the application update mechanism:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the `gurux.fi/obis/files.xml` and `gurux.fi/updates/updates.xml` for updates.

The provided content provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the attack vector, the exact method of exploitation using a crafted `files.xml` file, and providing a reproduction scenario that can be followed.
