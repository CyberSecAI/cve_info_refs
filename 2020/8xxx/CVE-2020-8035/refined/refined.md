Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of SVG image uploads within the Horde Groupware Webmail Edition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. By uploading a malicious SVG image containing JavaScript code, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining access to a victim's webmail account. This is achieved by tricking the victim into visiting a malicious URL where the attacker has uploaded the SVG.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG image file containing JavaScript payload to the Horde Webmail application.
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker then tricks a victim into visiting a URL where the malicious SVG image is displayed or processed, triggering the stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user of the Horde application with the ability to upload files (specifically SVG images).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would also need some method of social engineering to get the victim to access the malicious URL where the injected script would execute.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically located in the image view functionality of Horde Groupware Webmail Edition.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves protecting the image processing service from rendering active SVG content within the browser.
- The provided `CHANGES` file from github also confirms that the fix was implemented in version 5.2.22.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 2230-1) for php-horde also confirms the vulnerability and that the fix was included in version 5.2.1+debian0-2+deb8u6.
