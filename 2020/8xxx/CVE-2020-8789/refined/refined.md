Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8789:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the "name" parameter when editing a usergroup within the Composr CMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The CMS does not sanitize user-supplied input for the usergroup name, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code that will be stored and executed when a user views the "Zone editor" area.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code within the context of a targeted user's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing sensitive information, such as user credentials and personal data.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Security -> Usergroups -> Edit Usergroup" section of the Composr CMS.
- An attacker with the necessary permissions can modify the "name" parameter of a usergroup to include malicious code.
- The injected code is then executed when a user visits the "Zone editor" area, as the vulnerable parameter is used without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the Composr CMS.
- They need to have sufficient permissions to edit usergroups.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Manuel Garcia Cardenas.
- The vulnerable version of Composr CMS is 10.0.30 and earlier.
- The CVSS base score is 4.8/10.
- The vulnerability is a persistent XSS vulnerability, meaning the injected code is stored and executed when the affected area is accessed.
