Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-8710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Buffer overflow in the bootloader

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs when data written to a buffer exceeds the buffer's capacity, leading to the overwrite of adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should normally have.
*  Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*  Denial of Service: Though not explicitly stated in the description, the exploitation could lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Privileged User: The attacker must be a privileged user on the system, meaning they must have administrative or root level access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects "some Intel(R) Server Boards, Server Systems and Compute Modules before version 2.45."
*   The CVSS score is 8.2 (HIGH) with vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
* The affected NetApp products are NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage. These products have no plans to address this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was found internally by Ryan Hall of Intel's DCG Red Team.
