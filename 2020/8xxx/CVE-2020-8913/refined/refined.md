{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An unprotected broadcast receiver in the Google Play Core library allows third-party apps to send specially crafted intents, forcing a vulnerable app to copy arbitrary files to arbitrary locations specified in the `split_id` parameter, which is vulnerable to path-traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unprotected broadcast receiver",
    "Path traversal vulnerability due to lack of validation in the `split_id` parameter",
    "Lack of verification of copied files",
     "Loading of unverified code from arbitrary locations due to the automatic addition of files with `config.` prefix to the app's runtime ClassLoader"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution within the vulnerable application's context, potentially leading to data theft (login details, passwords, financial information), and other malicious activities like reading user's mail, intercepting browser history and cookies.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious app installed on the same device sends a crafted intent to the unprotected broadcast receiver of a vulnerable app, specifying a path traversal payload as the `split_id`, and an arbitrary file URI to be copied to that path. This can lead to loading malicious code in the vulnerable app's classloader.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the same Android device as the vulnerable application. The attacker must be able to craft and send intents to the unprotected broadcast receiver."
