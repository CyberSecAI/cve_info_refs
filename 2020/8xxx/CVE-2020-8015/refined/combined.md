[![Icon-security.png](/images/c/ca/Icon-security.png)](/File%3AIcon-security.png)

### Disclosure policy

The SUSE security team regularly audits software that is included
into/changed in (open)SUSE distributions and related products. For some details
of how and when we do this please
[read this](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3APackage_security_guidelines#Audit_Bugs_for_the_Security_Team).

During these audits we sometimes find security problems. This includes (but
is not limited to):

* security issues in the code itself
* weak configuration defaults
* problematic interaction with other components

We practice [coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29#Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure)
for these issues. This means that we notify internal and external stakeholders
via private channels to give them a chance to discuss the reported issues with
us and prepare a fix.

To ensure that issues found by us don't remain private for too long we have a
policy that mandates making the reported information available to the public
after a maximum embargo time of 90 days. This includes cases where no fixes are
readily available for end users. We do this to ensure that no known security
issue stays private for too long, giving users the information they need to
judge the security posture of the software they're using. If we don't receive
replies to our inquiries we reserve the right to shorten the embargo period
arbitrarily.

When there's no agreement on the CRD date or the issue itself we will make the
information public after 90 days at the latest to give the community a chance
to act and decide on their own.

We use the [openSUSE Bugzilla instance](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org) to track
security audits and the issues we find. When we open a Bugzilla entry about a
security issue we mark the current coordinated release date (CRD, time the
information becomes public) in a bug comment of the following format:

**Internal CRD: 2020-12-12 [or earlier | preliminary]**

An optional **or earlier** denotes cases where we're free to make it public at
any time (e.g. SUSE internal code with no external upstream). We use the
**preliminary** tag at the end when upstream has not agreed to a specific
date yet. In these cases we update the bug with a definite CRD (often earlier)
once it is agreed upon.

The CRD doesn't start with the creation of the bug itself, but only after
it is explicitly stated. In the initial report we usually suggest a shorter
embargo period of 14 to 30 days, depending on the complexity and further
context of the findings. In private discussions prolonged embargo periods can
be established, the 90 days maximum is a hard limit, however.

We also communicate these deadlines via other means (mostly email). For
non (open)SUSE parties we'll notify them 30 and 15 days (might shift
slightly since this is currently done manually, so this happens on German
workdays) before the CRD elapses if we have a suitable communications
channel.

When a SUSE employee is responsible for fixing the security issue (e.g. because
it is part of SUSE maintained code or configuration) we involve
- the manager of the employee 15 days before the CRD
- the next person in the reporting chain 5 days before the CRD
if there is no fix available for internal testing for all affected products.
This helps with situations where a packager is not responding, e.g. because
he's away.

For packages that are only on openSUSE that have no (active) maintainer we
file delete requests to openSUSE Factory if security issues are not fixed
within the given time span. This is done to ensure that packages with known
security issues are not carried in new products.

Should the established or offered embargo be violated by upstream or another
involved party by not following the coordinated disclosure process, for example
by publishing bugfix commits or updates ahead of the currently assigned CRD,
then the SUSE security team may consider to publish all relevant information
immediately.

I can reliably exploit this race by using inotify to watch the log directoy and change the file after the touch to a symlink.

Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not make this bug public  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at Internal CRD: 2020-05-18 or earlier This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. In that case we'll post a comment here setting the new date.  Only a member of the security team is allowed to make this issue public.
