Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A race condition exists in the exim package's post-installation script where log files are created.
- The script uses a sequence of `test -e`, `touch`, `chown`, and `chmod` to create the log files.
- An attacker can exploit a race between these operations to replace the log file with a symbolic link (symlink).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Symlink Following:** The vulnerability lies in the exim package's post-install script's use of `touch` to create log files. If a symlink replaces the log file after the `touch` and before the `chown` or `chmod`, then these subsequent operations would be applied to the target of the symlink and not the log file.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition, where an attacker must quickly create a symlink after the `touch` command, but before `chown` and `chmod` commands are executed by the exim package's post-install script.
- **Insecure File Creation:** The post-installation script attempts to create log files if they don't exist.  This is unnecessary since exim will create the files on its own if they are missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the log file with a symlink, an attacker with local access as the `mail` user can escalate privileges to root. They can cause the `chown` and `chmod` commands to operate on system files which they do not otherwise have permission to access.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The attacker could cause any file on the system to be owned by `mail:mail` and have permissions set to `640`.  In the proof of concept, the attacker targets `/etc/shadow`.
- **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The attacker can gain complete control over the system by overwriting critical system files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Mail User:** The attacker must have the privileges of the `mail` user.
- **Race Condition:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink in the very short window after the post-install script creates a new log file with `touch`, but before the `chown` and `chmod` commands are applied to the created file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to execute commands with the privileges of the `mail` user
- The attacker needs to be able to run commands fast enough to win the race condition

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by the exim package's post-install script logic.
- The vulnerability affects openSUSE Factory, openSUSE Leap 15.1 and SUSE Package Hub 15 SP1 and possibly other versions.
- The fix involved removing the loop in the post-install script that creates the log files since exim creates them on its own.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (High).
- The vulnerability is tracked in SUSE Bugzilla as bug 1154183.
- The issue was resolved by removing the insecure logic from the post install script
