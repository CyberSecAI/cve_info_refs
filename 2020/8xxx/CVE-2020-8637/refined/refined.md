Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `tree.class.php` and `testPlanUrgency.class.php` files. Specifically, the `nodeid` parameter in `dragdroptreenodes.php` and the `urgency` parameter in `planUrgency.php` are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates unsanitized user input into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials and other application data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation (PostgreSQL):** On PostgreSQL databases, an attacker can use stacked queries to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain administrative control. For example, the attacker could modify a user's role to grant admin privileges.
*   **Information Disclosure (MySQL):** On MySQL databases, while stacked queries are not possible, attackers can still dump data from the database, including user API keys and cookies. This can then be used to impersonate a user, including an admin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`dragdroptreenodes.php` (via `nodeid`):** The `nodeid` parameter, used in the `change_parent` method of the `tree.class.php`, is vulnerable to SQL injection. This can be exploited by manipulating the `nodeid` value in the `$_REQUEST` data.
*   **`planUrgency.php` (via `urgency`):** The `urgency` parameter, used in the `setTestUrgency` method of the `testPlanUrgency.class.php`, is vulnerable to SQL injection. This can be exploited by manipulating the `urgency` value in the `$_REQUEST` data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Testlink application.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker must have access to the web interface of the Testlink application to send requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection**: The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques in order to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content contains details on how to exploit the vulnerability, including specific payloads for both MySQL and PostgreSQL environments.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited using tools like `sqlmap` to automate the process of data extraction.
