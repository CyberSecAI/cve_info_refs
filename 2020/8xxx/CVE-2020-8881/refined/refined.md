        "vulnerability": {
          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-After-Free",
          "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
          "Attack vectors": "The specific flaw exists within the processing of TIF files. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.",
          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the victim visit a malicious page or open a malicious file."

         "vulnerability": {
            "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a wild pointer or an object that has been freed without proper validation.",
           "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"Use-After-Free vulnerability",
           "Impact of exploitation":"Attackers could exploit to execute remote code.",
           "Attack vectors":"This vulnerability occurs when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice the user to open a crafted PDF file."
          }
      }
    ],
    "Summary": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files where the existence of an object isn't validated before operations, leading to a use-after-free condition that can be exploited for remote code execution by enticing the user to open a malicious PDF/TIFF file."
