  "CVE-2020-8852": {
    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "The application could be exposed to an Out-of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure vulnerability when parsing certain JPEG2000 files. This occurs due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to validate user-supplied data while parsing JPEG2000 files, resulting in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "vulnerability": "Out-of-Bounds Read, Information Disclosure",
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information from the application's memory. This vulnerability can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a malicious JPEG2000 file or embedding malicious content within PDF documents, which, when opened by the application, can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious JPEG2000 file. User interaction is required in that the target must open a malicious file."
