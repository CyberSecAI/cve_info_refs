The provided content is a commit diff for a fix related to a potential vulnerability, but does not describe the vulnerability itself. It adds a check to ensure that the returned size from an untrusted read operation does not exceed the requested size, and if it does the program aborts.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The code did not verify the size of the returned data from the `enc_untrusted_read` system call. An attacker controlling the untrusted side might provide a size larger than requested.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper size validation on untrusted data returned from the `enc_untrusted_read` syscall.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious untrusted process could cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues when the trusted enclave uses the data returned from a `read` syscall from the untrusted environment that returns a size larger than requested by the enclave. The code change adds an explicit check to abort the program in this case.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to control the untrusted process. The vulnerability is triggered through a `read` system call using `enc_untrusted_read`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control the untrusted side of the application in order to manipulate the read return.
