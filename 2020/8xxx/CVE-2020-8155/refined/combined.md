| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c0)  Hans de Raad   2018-03-07 14:11:18 UTC  ``` Same issue as mentioned in: <https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1057661>  But then for the Nextcloud RPM: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/nextcloud/nextcloud.spec?expand=1](https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE%3AFactory/nextcloud/nextcloud.spec?expand=1)  Please consider to drop the dependency on mod_php_any as the package is currently uninstallable on Tumbleweed. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c1)  Eric Schirra   2018-03-08 07:26:11 UTC  ``` When i look at [https://build.opensuse.org/package/binary/openSUSE:Factory/php7?arch=x86_64&filename=apache2-mod_php7-7.2.2-2.1.x86_64.rpm&repository=standard](https://build.opensuse.org/package/binary/openSUSE%3AFactory/php7?arch=x86_64&filename=apache2-mod_php7-7.2.2-2.1.x86_64.rpm&repository=standard) :  Provides Symbol 	Required by mod_php_any = 7.2.2 	ganglia-web kohana2 phpPgAdmin postfixadmin robinhood-webgui icingaweb2 nextcloud nagios-www kopano-webapp matomo adminer roundcubemail cacti  So mod_php_any will be provide. So, why should nextcloud not installable?  Sorry. I have no tumbleweed.  I use 42.3 without any Problem. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c2)  Hans de Raad   2018-03-08 13:56:49 UTC  ``` I can only tell you that an update on Tumbleweed has been blocking installation of the RPM package several times over the past weeks. When searching bugzilla for this issue, this one for phpMyAdmin popped up: <https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1057661>  I guess it makes a valid case as Nextcloud isn't essentially a strict Apache application (an Nginx config is also offered in OBS).  To test this I have just installed a fresh vm with Tumbleweed and tried to install the nextcloud RPM. Apparently a Tumbleweed installment now does provide a working updated PHP. I'm a little baffled as this same action resulted in a failed installation with exactly the same steps in the past couple of weeks.  Will try to update the production server somewhere this weekend and update this issue with the results. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c3)  Eric Schirra   2018-04-13 07:59:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Hans de Raad from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c2)) > I can only tell you that an update on Tumbleweed has been blocking > installation of the RPM package several times over the past weeks. > When searching bugzilla for this issue, this one for phpMyAdmin popped up: > <https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1057661> >  > I guess it makes a valid case as Nextcloud isn't essentially a strict Apache > application (an Nginx config is also offered in OBS). >  > To test this I have just installed a fresh vm with Tumbleweed and tried to > install the nextcloud RPM.

Do you want the newest nextcloud install? This is momentan 13.0.1 And this version support php 7.2  Requires:       mod_php_any < 7.3.0 Requires:       mod_php_any >= 5.6.0  For some days or weeks the php version in Tumbleweed was to new to run with nextcloud.  And the module will only be enable when apache is install. in your link this patch only check if Apache MPM is *not* prefork.  Please look, check again and give replay. When not okay then post exactly the error message. Best use zypper. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c4)  Hans de Raad   2018-05-10 19:48:53 UTC  ``` The latest Tumbleweed snapshot (may 2018) seems to include the relevant PHP related packages so the update works now. I have been able to update without issues now. I will reopen the issue if the problem reappears with more debugging info. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c5)  Hans de Raad   2019-02-08 21:16:08 UTC  ``` Currently there is another occurrence of this issue where mod_php_any can not be provided due to a version conflict. The factory PHP version is 7.3.1, the nextcloud spec requires < 7.3.0.  This prevents a Nextcloud update on a recent Tumbleweed (20190115) version. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c6)  Eric Schirra   2019-02-08 21:48:46 UTC  ``` Fix is on they way. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c7)  Eric Schirra   2019-02-08 21:50:27 UTC  ``` Fixed ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c8)  Hans de Raad   2019-02-08 22:33:48 UTC  ``` Cool, thanks for your very fast response! As soon as the repo mirrors have synced I'll give it another shot! ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c9)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-05-13 17:10:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1084320) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/805352> Backports:SLE-12 / nextcloud ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1084320#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-05-17 19:12:38 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0667-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one errata is now available.
