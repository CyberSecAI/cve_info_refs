{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Backblaze client's service process, `bzserv`, runs as SYSTEM/root and executes `bztransmit` to download updates. The `bztransmit` process does not verify or update the ACL/permissions of the update directory if it already exists, allowing a local attacker to take ownership.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file/directory permissions",
      "Lack of verification of existing directory permissions",
      "Race condition during update process"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM/root",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local unprivileged user"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged access is required to create directories before the vulnerable service creates them or modify already existing directories to gain ownership."
