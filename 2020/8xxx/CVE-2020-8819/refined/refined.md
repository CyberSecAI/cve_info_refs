Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8819

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of origin authentication in the IPN (Instant Payment Notification) callback processing function of the CardGate Payment Gateway plugin for WooCommerce. Specifically, the plugin's configuration update function `cardgate_callback` doesn't verify if the request originates from a trusted source before updating crucial plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Origin Authentication (CWE-346):** The plugin does not validate the source of the `cgp_sitesetup` and `token` parameters before processing them, which leads to an attacker's ability to modify the store's settings remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated Settings Modification:** This allows an attacker to change critical settings such as merchant ID, hash key, and API keys, effectively hijacking the payment process.
*   **Order Status Spoofing:** The vulnerability can also be exploited to spoof order status without a real payment by sending a crafted IPN callback request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Payments Hijacking:** An attacker can modify the payment gateway settings to redirect payments to their own account.
*   **Order Status Spoofing:** Attackers can mark orders as paid without completing a real payment process, allowing them to obtain goods or services without paying.
*   **Complete Control over Payment Processing:** By controlling the payment gateway configuration, an attacker gains the ability to manipulate the entire payment flow.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be performed remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `cardgate_callback` function.
*   **IPN Callback Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the plugin's IPN callback mechanism (`cgp_notify=true`) for both settings modification and order status spoofing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WooCommerce store.
*   **CardGate Merchant Account:** The attacker needs to have a CardGate merchant account to generate the required `token` and related settings to inject into the target system.
*   **Publicly Accessible Script:** The attacker needs to host a script that acts as a callback URL which can be used in the CardGate merchant settings to trigger the vulnerability in the target store.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippet from `cardgate.php` is located within the `cardgate_callback` function:
```php
if (! empty($_REQUEST['cgp_sitesetup']) && ! empty($_REQUEST['token'])) {
    try {
        require_once WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/cardgate/cardgate-clientlib-php/init.php';
        $bIsTest = ($_REQUEST['testmode'] == 1 ? true : false);
        $aResult = cardgate\api\Client::pullConfig($_REQUEST['token'], $bIsTest);
        $aConfigData = $aResult['pullconfig']['content'];
        update_option('cgp_mode', $aConfigData['testmode']);
        update_option('cgp_siteid', $aConfigData['site_id']);
        update_option('cgp_hashkey', $aConfigData['site_key']);
        update_option('cgp_merchant_id', $aConfigData['merchant_id']);
        update_option('cgp_merchant_api_key', $aConfigData['api_key']);
        die($aConfigData['merchant'] . '.' . get_option('cgp_siteid') . '.200');
    } catch (cardgate\api\Exception $oException_) {
        die(htmlspecialchars($oException_->getMessage()));
    }
}
```

This code block processes the `cgp_sitesetup` and `token` parameters to update plugin settings without any checks of the source.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in a later version of the plugin (via PR #17).
* The proof-of-concept exploit provided in the content includes instructions and code to demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability.
* The provided exploit requires the attacker to register a merchant account on CardGate and set up a fake site to gain access to the configuration `token`.

This detailed breakdown aligns with the information provided in the various sources, indicating a significant security flaw in the handling of plugin configuration updates within the affected versions.
