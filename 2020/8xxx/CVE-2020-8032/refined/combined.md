| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1180669#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2021-01-07 15:51:29 UTC  ``` In cyrus-sasl.spec 217 %pre 218 #Convert password file from berkely into gdbm 219 #In %pre the existing file will be dumped out 220 if [ -e /etc/sasldb2 ]; then 221 cat <<EOF > /tmp/saslpw.awk 222 { 223         split(\$0,b,/\\\00/) 224         if( b[3] == "userPassword" ) { 225                 user=b[1] 226                 domain=b[2] 227         } else { 228                 if( user != "" ) { 229                         printf("echo '%s' | saslpasswd2 -p -u %s %s\n",substr(b[1],2),user,domain) 230                         user = "" 231                         domain = "" 232                 } 233         } 234 } 235 EOF 236 db_dump -p /etc/sasldb2 | gawk -f /tmp/saslpw.awk > /var/adm/update-scripts/saslpwd  allows users on the system to escalate to root. If a user creates /tmp/saslpw.awk before this runs and then monitors the file (e.g. inotifywait /tmp/saslpw.awk) he can change it to arbitrary content after cat writes it, but before gawk is called. When something like this BEGIN {system("chown johannes /etc/shadow")} is written to the file this allows escalating to root as this snippet is executed with root privileges.  Rating low since this can only be triggered once and the race is hard to win. Reproduction: as root (if /etc/sasldb2 doesn't exist) cp /etc/postfix/relocated.db /etc/sasldb2 otherwise db_dump will fails and it stops there.  As user: inotifywait /tmp/saslpw.awk; echo 'BEGIN {system("chown johannes /etc/shadow")}' > /tmp/saslpw.awk  Then as root install the package zypper in -y -f cyrus-sasl  It's hard to win the race, but with a more optimized exploit this should work.  This was recently introduced into Factory, so we need a CVE for it: CVE-2020-8032  Please use a safe way to create temporary files or (better) don't write them to a location that users can influence.  CRD: 2021-04-07 as specified in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy), but I would ask you to fix it right away to keep the window where this can be abused short. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1180669#c4)  Johannes Segitz   2021-02-11 14:52:40 UTC  ``` can you please submit for Factory?
