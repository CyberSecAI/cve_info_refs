{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure temporary file usage during the conversion of password files in the cyrus-sasl package.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `/tmp/saslpw.awk` file is created with insecure permissions. A race condition exists where a local user can modify this file after it's created by the installation script but before the `gawk` command is executed, allowing them to inject arbitrary code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root. By injecting malicious code into the temporary file, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local user can create and modify the `/tmp/saslpw.awk` file during the package installation or update process, exploiting a race condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system and be able to write to the /tmp directory."
