Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-8284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from curl's handling of FTP PASV responses. When curl uses passive mode for FTP transfers, it relies on the server's PASV response, which includes the IP address and port for the data connection. A malicious server could provide a manipulated IP address, causing curl to connect to an unintended host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure reliance on server-provided IP:** curl trusts the IP address provided in the PASV response without validation or proper checks.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** curl does not sanitize or validate the IP address received from the server.
- **Exposure of private services:** Curl can be tricked into connecting to internal services, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can trick curl into connecting to internal services, performing port scanning, and extracting service banners. This can expose sensitive information about the network.
- **Potential for further attacks:** The exposed internal services can then be targeted for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious FTP server:** An attacker sets up a malicious FTP server that provides a manipulated IP address in the PASV response.
- **User-provided URLs:** If curl is used with URLs provided by users, a user could supply a URL pointing to the attacker's malicious FTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a malicious FTP server:** The attacker needs to control an FTP server.
- **(Optional) User interaction:** If the application is not vulnerable to user-provided URLS, then no interaction is needed.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to IPv4 because PASV is not used with IPv6. curl prefers EPSV over PASV when available.
- The vulnerability has existed since the first day FTP support was added to curl.
- Mitigation is available via the `--ftp-skip-pasv-ip` option, which makes curl ignore the provided IP. The fix changes the default behavior to ignore it.

This CVE is about the vulnerability in curl's usage of FTP PASV responses. It allows a malicious FTP server to redirect curl to connect to an arbitrary address and port, which can lead to information disclosure.
