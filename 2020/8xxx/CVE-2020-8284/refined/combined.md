## CVE-2020-8284

# trusting FTP PASV responses

Project curl Security Advisory, December 9th 2020 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8284.html)

## VULNERABILITY

When curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the
`EPSV` command and if that is not supported, it falls back to
using `PASV`. Passive mode is what curl uses by default.

A server response to a `PASV` command includes the (IPv4)
address and port number for the client to connect back to in order to
perform the actual data transfer.

This is how the FTP protocol is designed to work.

A malicious server can use the `PASV` response to trick
curl into connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way
potentially make curl extract information about services that are
otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning and
service banner extractions.

If curl operates on a URL provided by a user (which by all means is
an unwise setup), a user can exploit that and pass in a URL to a
malicious FTP server instance without needing any server breach to
perform the attack.

## INFO

This issue has existed in curl for as long as FTP has been supported,
since day 1.

The flaw only exists for IPv4 since `PASV` does not work
for IPv6 and curl prefers `EPSV`. The passive mode setup for
FTP is used for both uploads and downloads.

curl can be built without FTP support and applications can explicitly
disable FTP for single transfers.

curl users could already mitigate this flaw with
`[CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.html)` and
`--ftp-skip-pasv-ip`.

Other FTP clients have in the past also had this flaw and have fixed
it at different points in time. Firefox fixed it in 2007:
CVE-2007-1562.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2020-8284 to this issue.

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized
Actor

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl 4.0 to and including [7.73.0](vuln-7.73.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl >= [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ae1912cb0d494b48d>

Also note that (lib)curl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

The IP address part of the response is now ignored by default, by
making `[CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.html)` default to `1L`
instead of previously being `0L`.

This has the minor drawback that a small fraction of use cases might
break, when a server truly needs the client to connect back to a
different IP address than what the control connection uses and for those
`[CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.html)` can be set to `0L`.

The same goes for the command line tool, which then might need
`--no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip` set to prevent curl from ignoring the
address in the server response.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/ec9cc725d598ac>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade libcurl to version [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)

B - Set `[CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.html)` to `1L` or
use `--ftp-skip-pasv-ip`

C - Disable FTP availability for your transfers

## TIMELINE

This issue was first reported to the curl project on November 21,
2020.

This advisory was posted on December 9 2020.

## CVE-2020-8285

# FTP wildcard stack overflow

Project curl Security Advisory, December 9th 2020 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8285.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a
callback (set with `[CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION.html)`) to return
information back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a
directory when libcurl iterates over a list of all available
entries.

When this callback returns `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP`, to
tell libcurl to not deal with that file, the internal function in
libcurl then calls itself recursively to handle the next directory
entry.

If there is a sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback
returns "skip" enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space.
The exact amount does of course vary with platforms, compilers and other
environmental factors.

The content of the remote directory is not kept on the stack, so it
seems hard for the attacker to control exactly what data that overwrites
the stack - however it remains a Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious
user who controls a server that a libcurl-using application works with
under these premises can trigger a crash.

(There is also a few other ways the function can be made to call
itself and trigger this problem.)

## INFO

This issue was unfortunately reported publicly in the curl GitHub
issue tracker as [issue 6255](https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/6255).

This functionality is not used by the curl tool so it is not
affected. Further: it is not a very widely used feature.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2020-8285 to this issue.

CWE-674: Uncontrolled Recursion

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.21.0](vuln-7.21.0.html) to and including [7.73.0](vuln-7.73.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.21.0](vuln-7.21.0.html) and libcurl >=
  [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/0825cd80a>

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

The internal function is rewritten to instead and more appropriately
use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive approach. This way, the
stack use remains the same no matter how many files that are
skipped.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/69a358f2186e04>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade libcurl to version [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)

B - Disable FTP wildcard use (`[CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH.html)`)

C - Make sure your `[CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION.html)` callback
does not do multiple skips.

## TIMELINE

This issue was first reported to the curl project on November 27,
2020.

This advisory was posted on December 9th 2020.

## CVE-2020-8286

# Inferior OCSP verification

Project curl Security Advisory, December 9th 2020 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2020-8286.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl offers "OCSP stapling" via the
`[CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS.html)` option. When set, libcurl verifies
the OCSP response that a server responds with as part of the TLS
handshake. It then aborts the TLS negotiation if something is wrong with
the response. The same feature can be enabled with
`--cert-status` using the curl tool.

As part of the OCSP response verification, a client should verify
that the response is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This
step was not performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL as
TLS backend.

This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps could have breached a
TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP response that would appear
fine, instead of the real one. Like if the original certificate actually
has been revoked.

## INFO

The vulnerability is present only if OpenSSL is the designated TLS
backend. OCSP stapling is not enabled by default by libcurl, it needs to
be explicitly enabled by the application to get used.

OCSP Stapling can be used with any of the TLS based protocols curl
supports, including HTTPS, FTPS, SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS, HTTPS-proxy and
more.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2020-8286 to this issue.

CWE-299: Improper Check for Certificate Revocation

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: libcurl [7.41.0](vuln-7.41.0.html) to and including [7.73.0](vuln-7.73.0.html)
* Not affected versions: libcurl < [7.41.0](vuln-7.41.0.html) and libcurl >=
  [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d1cf5d570663d>

Also note that libcurl is used by many applications, and not always
advertised as such.

## SOLUTION

The OCSP response checker function now also verifies that the
certificate id is the correct one.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d9d01672785b>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in
order of preference:

A - Upgrade libcurl to version [7.74.0](vuln-7.74.0.html)

B - Do not rely on OCSP

## TIMELINE

This issue was first reported to the curl project on December 2,
2020.

This advisory was posted on December 9th 2020.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : curl
Version        : 7.52.1-5+deb9u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-8284 CVE-2020-8285 CVE-2020-8286
Debian Bug     : 977161 977162 977163

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in curl, a command line tool for
transferring data with URL syntax and an easy-to-use client-side URL
transfer library.

CVE-2020-8284

    When curl performs a passive FTP transfer, it first tries the EPSV
    command and if that is not supported, it falls back to using PASV.
    Passive mode is what curl uses by default.  A server response to a
    PASV command includes the (IPv4) address and port number for the
    client to connect back to in order to perform the actual data
    transfer.  This is how the FTP protocol is designed to work.  A
    malicious server can use the PASV response to trick curl into
    connecting back to a given IP address and port, and this way
    potentially make curl extract information about services that are
    otherwise private and not disclosed, for example doing port scanning
    and service banner extractions.

    The IP address part of the response is now ignored by default, by
    making CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP default to 1L instead of previously
    being 0L.  This has the minor drawback that a small fraction of use
    cases might break, when a server truly needs the client to connect
    back to a different IP address than what the control connection uses
    and for those CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP can be set to 0L.  The same
    goes for the command line tool, which then might need
    --no-ftp-skip-pasv-ip set to prevent curl from ignoring the address
    in the server response.

CVE-2020-8285

    libcurl offers a wildcard matching functionality, which allows a
    callback (set with CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION) to return information
    back to libcurl on how to handle a specific entry in a directory
    when libcurl iterates over a list of all available entries.  When
    this callback returns CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP, to tell libcurl to
    not deal with that file, the internal function in libcurl then calls
    itself recursively to handle the next directory entry.  If there's a
    sufficient amount of file entries and if the callback returns "skip"
    enough number of times, libcurl runs out of stack space.  The exact
    amount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other
    environmental factors.  The content of the remote directory is not
    kept on the stack, so it seems hard for the attacker to control
    exactly what data that overwrites the stack - however it remains a
    Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious user who controls a server
    that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can
    trigger a crash.

    The internal function is rewritten to instead and more appropriately
    use an ordinary loop instead of the recursive approach. This way,
    the stack use will remain the same no matter how many files that are
    skipped.

CVE-2020-8286

    libcurl offers "OCSP stapling" via the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS
    option. When set, libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server
    responds with as part of the TLS handshake.  It then aborts the TLS
    negotiation if something is wrong with the response. The same
    feature can be enabled with --cert-status using the curl tool.  As
    part of the OCSP response verification, a client should verify that
    the response is indeed set out for the correct certificate.  This
    step was not performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL
    as TLS backend.  This flaw would allow an attacker, who perhaps
    could have breached a TLS server, to provide a fraudulent OCSP
    response that would appear fine, instead of the real one.  Like if
    the original certificate actually has been revoked.

    The OCSP response checker function now also verifies that the
    certificate id is the correct one.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
7.52.1-5+deb9u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian Bug     : 965280 965281 968831 977161 977162 977163

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:

CVE-2020-8169

    Marek Szlagor reported that libcurl could be tricked into prepending
    a part of the password to the host name before it resolves it,
    potentially leaking the partial password over the network and to the
    DNS server(s).

CVE-2020-8177

    sn reported that curl could be tricked by a malicious server into
    overwriting a local file when using th -J (--remote-header-name) and
    -i (--include) options in the same command line.

CVE-2020-8231

    Marc Aldorasi reported that libcurl might use the wrong connection
    when an application using libcurl's multi API sets the option
    CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, which could lead to information leaks.

CVE-2020-8284

    Varnavas Papaioannou reported that a malicious server could use the
    PASV response to trick curl into connecting back to an arbitrary IP
    address and port, potentially making curl extract information about
    services that are otherwise private and not disclosed.

CVE-2020-8285

    xnynx reported that libcurl could run out of stack space when using
    tha FTP wildcard matching functionality (CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION).

CVE-2020-8286

    It was reported that libcurl didn't verify that an OCSP response
    actually matches the certificate it is intended to.

CVE-2021-22876

    Viktor Szakats reported that libcurl does not strip off user
    credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer
    HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests.

CVE-2021-22890

    Mingtao Yang reported that, when using an HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3,
    libcurl could confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy
    as if they arrived from the remote server instead. This could allow
    an HTTPS proxy to trick libcurl into using the wrong session ticket
    for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.64.0-4+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

For the detailed security status of curl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/curl>

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug
in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls
node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as ﬁrst argument. If the DoWrite
method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult
structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other
exploits.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overﬂow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a ﬁeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to ﬂaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using
a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
whenparsing the string provided by the application.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22926

libcurl-using applications can ask for a speciﬁc client certiﬁcate to be used in a transfer. This is done
with the CURLOPT_SSLCERT option (--cert with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use the
macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for the client certiﬁcate by name
or with a ﬁle name - using the same option. If the name exists as a ﬁle, it will be used instead of by
name.If the appliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by other users (like /tmp), a
malicious user can create a ﬁle name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, and
thereby trick the application to use the ﬁle based cert instead of the one referred to by name making
libcurl send the wrong client certiﬁcate in the TLS connection handshake.

to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (--ssl-reqd on the command line orCURLOPT_USE_SSL set to
CURLUSESSL_CONTROL or CURLUSESSL_ALL withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the

When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using

once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not ﬂush the in-queue of cached responses
but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got before the TLS handshake as if they were
authenticated.Using this ﬂaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to ﬁrst inject the fake responses,
then pass-through the TLS trafﬁc from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to
the user thinking the attacker’s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.

-> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of
the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected
version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default
settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufﬁcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any ﬁle whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in
releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-32804

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which
ﬁxes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches
for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on
Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same ﬁle system entities as their 8.3 “short
path” counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the
path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same ﬁle system entity,
followed by a ﬁle using the ﬁrst form. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the ﬁlesystem, it
was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39135

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency
contracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the
expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.
