## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1816#issue-550426754)

In `src/analysisd/cleanevent.c` the `OS_CleanMSG` function performs pattern matching and if applicable, tries to decode syslog messages to populate some `lf` structure fields according to the syslog data.

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c#L88-L169)

When a message contains leading text matching the patterns expected for syslog, and contains a substring like `"[ID xx facility.severity]"` in the correct location `OS_CleanMSG` will attempt to remove it by advancing the `lf->log` pointer beyond the end of the substring:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c#L327-L345)

Lines 327 to 345
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | /\* Remove [ID xx facility.severity] \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | if (pieces) { |
|  | /\* Set log after program name \*/ |
|  | lf->log = pieces; |
|  |  |
|  | if ((pieces[0] == '[') && |
|  | (pieces[1] == 'I') && |
|  | (pieces[2] == 'D') && |
|  | (pieces[3] == ' ')) { |
|  | pieces += 4; |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Going after the ] \*/ |
|  | pieces = strchr(pieces, ']'); |
|  | if (pieces) { |
|  | pieces += 2; |
|  | lf->log = pieces; |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  | } |

The code is careful about checking the result from `strstr` when advancing to the expected closing `]`, however it makes an assumption that there must be a non-null character following the `]` when it subsequently advances the `pieces` pointer by 2:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c#L341)

Line 341
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | pieces += 2; |
| --- | --- |

If a message like `"Oct 31 00:00:00 0 sshd: [ID 0 auth.notice]"` is processed `OS_CleanMSG` will advance beyond the terminating null byte of `lf->log`, resulting in a heap overflow when operating on the `lf->log` pointer subsequently during decoding.

This code was introduced in [8672fa0](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/8672fa0d5acd1087c285e664804bfa455e9cfd07) on Nov 18, 2006. I believe it affects [OSSEC 2.7+](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/releases/tag/v2.7).

This is triggerable via an authenticated client through the `ossec-remoted`. The client needs only write a message to the remote server of any queue type that will match the expected syslog format and authority substring, but end immediately after the `]`.

I think the best fix is to change the `pieces` pointer to be incremented by 1 instead of 2, or to update the `strstr` check for `"[ "` instead of just `"["` (edit: implemented in [#1824](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1824)),.

## Description

In OSSEC-HIDS 2.7 through 3.5.0, the server component responsible for log analysis (ossec-analysisd) is vulnerable to an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow during the cleaning of crafted syslog msgs (received from authenticated remote agents and delivered to the analysisd processing queue by ossec-remoted).

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1821#issue-550427631)

Hi folks,

I spent some free time recently auditing OSSEC. I was primarily focused on a threat model where an OSSEC agent is compromised (e.g. the agent key and assoc. counters are known) and used to attack the OSSEC server (primarily `ossec-remoted` and `ossec-analysisd`). Given the problem domain of OSSEC and HIDS generally I think this is fair game. Since these are post-auth bugs and there isn't guidance on vulnerability disclosure in the README I thought it was acceptable to post information full-disclosure to the repo.

I found a handful of bugs and have done my best to address the root cause, the affected versions, the impact and potential fixes in the issues I've filed. I will request CVEs for the security relevant bugs later on.

In terms of rough risk levels I'd categorize the findings as follows:

Informational:

* rootcheck-check-rc-if-shell-injection-risk - [rootcheck: risk of shell metachar injection in check-rc-if. #1812](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1812)

Low:

* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-allows-control-chars-in-msg ([CVE-2020-8445](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9vhf-xgg9-m6cf "CVE-2020-8445")) - [CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. #1814](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-bad-location-segfault ([CVE-2020-8448](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vg3-7pxv-7pq6 "CVE-2020-8448")) - [CVE-2020-8448: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG segfault processing invalid msg location. #1815](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1815) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix possible null ptr deref in OS\_CleanMSG. #1823](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1823)*)
* ~~analysisd-syscheck-decoder-off-by-one-read - [syscheck decoder: off-by-one heap overflow in DB operations. #1819](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1819)~~ (*Edit: I made a mistake in my analysis here, it's not a bug*).

Med:

Some caveats/context to add:

1. I'm not a professional C coder, w.r.t suggested fixes YMMV!
2. I don't write exploits for a living. My assessments of exploitability/risk should be considered lower bounds.
3. This wasn't an extensive audit. I followed my nose and used some fuzzing.
4. OSSEC 2.7 seems to be the earliest tag in the Github repo. I didn't dig deeper into history to see if any of these bugs affect older releases (some likely do).

If you would be interested in trying to adopt fuzzing as part of your CI (or as an integration with oss-fuzz, etc) I'd be happy to try and provide some notes but likely don't have the resources to implement it myself to a merge-able standard of work.

Thanks! You can close this top-level issue as you see appropriate.

When removing the `"[ID xx facility.severity] "` substring of a syslog message in `OS_CleanMSG` care needs to be taken to stay within the bounds of the msg buffer when advancing past the `"] "` in the msg.

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1819#issue-550427154)

Edit: see my [comment below](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1819#issuecomment-575347365) this analysis was flawed. Apologies!

The `ossec-analysisd'`s syscheck decoder (`src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c`) allocates two fixed size heap buffers via the global static struct `sdb`:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c#L55)

Line 55

[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | static \_sdb sdb; |
| --- | --- |

The `_sdb` struct contains two fixed size arrays, one of `char*` called `agent_ips` and one of `FILE*` called `agent_fps`, both sized `MAX_AGENTS` (default build value is 2048). (edit: this was wrong)

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c#L34-L35)

[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | char \*agent\_ips[MAX\_AGENTS + 1]; |
| --- | --- |
|  | FILE \*agent\_fps[MAX\_AGENTS + 1]; |

In `DB_SetCompleted` and `DB_File` a `while` loop with a index counter `i` is used to try and find an index of `sbd.agent_ips` that matches the provided `agent` name.

To prevent `i` exceeding `MAX_AGENTS` the `while` loops are written:

```
    while (sdb.agent_ips[i] != NULL &&  i < MAX_AGENTS) {

```

Unfortunately due to the ordering of the clauses that means that when `i == MAX_AGENTS` the `sdb.agent_ips[i]` clause that is evaluated **first** will be accessing outside of the bounds of `sdb.agent_ips` by 1, likely reading into `sdb.agent_fps[0]`.

This code was introduced in [91aa29a](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/91aa29aeb84d1f125a898308a01ffbf50f4480b8) on Feb 7, 2012 while patching a more significant buffer overflow found by Paul Southerington. I believe it affects OSSEC v2.7+.

I suspect the fixed code is not exploitable, but is a buggy remediation.

This is triggerable via an authenticated client through the `ossec-remoted`. The client needs only write MAX\_AGENT syscheck update messages with distinct message agent names.

While `ossec-remoted` always sets the agent name portion of messages passed on to `ossec-analysisd` with a prefix out of the attackers control based on the configured agent key and source IP (`($NAME) $SRCPIP->`), the portion after this prefix is attacker controlled and thus can be mutated to make MAX\_AGENT unique names.

The `while` conditions in `DB_File` and `DB_SetCompleted` should be rewritten to short circuit if `i >= MAX_AGENTS` before dereferencing `sdb.agent_ips[i]`.

E.g. instead of:

```
    while (sdb.agent_ips[i] != NULL &&  i < MAX_AGENTS) {

```

Use:

```
    while (i < MAX_AGENTS && sdb.agent_ips[i] != NULL) {

```
