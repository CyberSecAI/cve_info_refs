{
  "CVE-2020-8554": {
    "Root cause": "A design flaw in Kubernetes allows attackers with the ability to create or edit services and pods to intercept traffic.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Ability to create a ClusterIP service and set the spec.externalIPs field.",
       "Ability to patch the status of a LoadBalancer service and set the status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may be able to intercept traffic from other pods or nodes within the cluster.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Creating a ClusterIP service and setting the spec.externalIPs field.",
       "Patching the status of a LoadBalancer service and setting the status.loadBalancer.ingress.ip."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to create or edit services and pods. The ability to patch service/status is considered a privileged operation."
  }
