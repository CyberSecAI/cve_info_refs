  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling TIF files using the `GetTIFPalette` method, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack requires user interaction. The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious TIF file."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious TIF file, or visit a malicious web page.",
    "details": "Foxit Studio Photo application is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. The application does not validate user-supplied data when parsing TIF files with the GetTIFPalette method, resulting in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process."
