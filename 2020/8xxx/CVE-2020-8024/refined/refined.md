Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Incorrect default file permissions within the hylafax+ package. Specifically, several files and directories were owned by the `uucp` user and group instead of `root`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `uucp` user had write access to critical hylafax+ files, including libraries, binaries, and configuration files located in `/usr/lib64/`, `/etc/hylafax`, and `/var/spool/hylafax`. This allowed the `uucp` user to modify these files.
- **Code Injection via eval:**  The script `bin/faxrcvd` uses `eval` on entries located in the `/var/spool/hylafax/bin/dict` directory. Because `uucp` could write to `/var/spool/hylafax/bin/dict`, the `uucp` user could inject code that would be executed when `bin/faxrcvd` was called.
- **Postscript Code Injection:** The file `genfontmap.ps` which is part of the hylafax+ package and used in `/usr/sbin/faxsetup` is a postscript file. Because Postscript is a Turing complete language, malicious postscript code could be included and potentially executed by the fax system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker, leveraging the `uucp` user, could escalate privileges to other users, including `root`, by modifying hylafax+ binaries and configuration files or through code injection in configuration files.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the fax service, potentially `root`, due to insecure file permissions and use of `eval`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Compromised uucp Account:**  The attacker needs to either have control over the `uucp` account or be able to leverage the `uucp` account's write permissions to gain control of the affected files and directories.
- **File Modification:** The attacker modifies the vulnerable files to execute malicious code or alter system behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system or have gained access to a local account.
- **uucp User:** The attacker needs to have write permissions to files and directories owned by the `uucp` user.
- **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of Linux file permissions and how the hylafax+ software works.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability is present in openSUSE Leap 15.2, openSUSE Leap 15.1, and openSUSE Factory.
- The fix involves changing the ownership of the vulnerable files and directories to `root:root`.
- The vulnerable files include, but are not limited to:
    - `/usr/lib64/libfaxserver.so.7.0.2`
    - Files and directories under `/etc/hylafax/faxmail/application`
    - Files and directories under `/var/spool/hylafax/` including `/var/spool/hylafax/bin`
    - Files in `/var/spool/hylafax/bin/dict`
    - `/var/spool/hylafax/bin/genfontmap.ps`
