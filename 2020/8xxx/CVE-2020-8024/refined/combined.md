| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 12:37:51 UTC  ``` Found by Matthias Gerstner. Most problematic is uucp:uucp -rwxr-xr-x /usr/lib64/libfaxserver.so.7.0.2  uucp can easily extend libfaxserver.so.7.0.2 to run arbitrary code. Example:  # id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 # /usr/sbin/faxq I'm a backdoor  Please set the permissions to root.root. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 13:34:03 UTC  ``` This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  The information listed here is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at Internal CRD: 2020-09-07 or earlier This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. This is an internal finding, you can make it public whenever you have a fix ready ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c2)  Axel Braun   2020-06-09 14:16:22 UTC  ``` This issue is branched to [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:DocB:branches:network:telephony/hylafax](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3ADocB%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/hylafax)+ and should already be corrected. please check ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-15 08:36:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c2)) I made the bug public.

Sorry for the delay, didn't see your reply in my mails (we had some issues there).                                                                                   I don't think that this is sufficient. uucp can still change the binaries below /etc/hylafax/faxmail/application. I would suggest to have root own all below /etc/hylafax.  Also /var/spool/hylafax still belongs to uucp. With this uucp can still remove binaries from e.g. /var/spool/hylafax/bin and add his own there. For /var/spool/hylafax and below the default owner should be root, with exceptions being clearly defined  Also Leap 15.1 still needs a submission please :) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c8)  Axel Braun   2020-07-01 07:34:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c7)) > Thanks for the submission.

For > /var/spool/hylafax and below the default owner should be root, with > exceptions being clearly defined  I have done a couple of tests and fine-tuned the ownership: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:DocB:branches:network:telephony/hylafax](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3ADocB%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/hylafax)+  You may want to review the settings, but from my tests so far it looks good  > Also Leap 15.1 still needs a submission please :)  Sure :-) ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c9)  Axel Braun   2020-07-06 12:27:42 UTC  ``` <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/818994> should fix the permissions ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c10)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-07-06 14:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172731) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/819005> 15.1 / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/819006> 15.2 / hylafax+ ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c11)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-07-14 10:17:19 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0958-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.  Category: security (moderate) Bug References: 1172731 CVE References: CVE-2020-8024 Sources used: openSUSE Leap 15.1 (src):    hylafax+-7.0.2-lp151.4.3.1 ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c12)  Axel Braun   2020-08-11 08:54:22 UTC  ``` I have submitted <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825727> containing hylafax 7.0.3 - this should contain the remaining fixes @Johannes - please review and close bug if satisfied ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c13)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-08-11 09:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172731) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825731> Factory / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825733> 15.2 / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825734> 15.1 / hylafax+ ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c14)  Johannes Segitz   2020-09-09 07:06:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c12)) Thanks for the submissions. The permissions are better, but still not perfect. E.g. in /var/spool/hylafax/bin most files are now owned by root, but genfontmap.ps is not. Why? Postscript is a turing complete language and as this file is used in /usr/sbin/faxsetup this might be used to escalate privileges (didn't try it).  Please reorder the file list to have all files with default permissions (e.g. owned by root) at the top and then have the exeptions at the end. Currently it's changed several times, which introduces unnecessary risks and makes it hard to read.   Please check if   %{faxspool}/config/*   %{faxspool}/bin/dict/*   %{faxspool}/bin/genfontmap.ps   %{faxspool}/bin/auto-rotate.ps   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/dpsprinter.ps   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/cover.templ   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/lutRS18.pcf   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/LiberationSans-25.pcf   %config(noreplace) %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/dialrules* really need to be owned by uucp ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c15)  Axel Braun   2020-10-10 10:06:23 UTC  ``` I have regrouped the permissions and tested them on my local installation - hylafax still works :-) Please review  [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:DocB:branches:network:telephony/hylafax](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3ADocB%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/hylafax)+  before I submit.  Thanks! ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2020-10-13 08:36:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c15)) So I had a look and saw that  %dir %{faxspool}/bin/dict is owned by uucp. This is problematic because some dict entries are eval'd and if uucp can edit them then this allows for code execution. E.g. bin/faxrcvd    78     if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then    79         eval echo "$DICTRECEIVEDFROM";    80     else    81         eval echo "$DICTNOTRECEIVED";    82     fi This by editing the file for the current locale in /var/spool/hylafax/bin/dict this allows to execute arbitrary code.   Please make %{faxspool}/bin/dict root owned  I'm pretty sure I can continue to find issues as long as I look ;) But given that fax maybe will not be dominant technology of the 21th century I think that's enough time spent here. So with that last change we can close this bug. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c17)  Axel Braun   2020-10-13 11:21:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c16)) >  > Please make %{faxspool}/bin/dict root owned  It was actually...but mentioned in the uucp section as well. Looks like the last wins.   > I'm pretty sure I can continue to find issues as long as I look ;) But given > that fax maybe will not be dominant technology of the 21th century I think > that's enough time spent here.

OK, Thanks for your help on this! ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c18)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-16 13:50:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172731) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842111> 15.1 / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842112> 15.2 / hylafax+ ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c19)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-19 22:23:40 UTC  ``` openSUSE-RU-2020:1700-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 12:37:51 UTC  ``` Found by Matthias Gerstner. Most problematic is uucp:uucp -rwxr-xr-x /usr/lib64/libfaxserver.so.7.0.2  uucp can easily extend libfaxserver.so.7.0.2 to run arbitrary code. Example:  # id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 # /usr/sbin/faxq I'm a backdoor  Please set the permissions to root.root. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 13:34:03 UTC  ``` This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  The information listed here is not public.

I don't think that this is sufficient. uucp can still change the binaries below /etc/hylafax/faxmail/application. I would suggest to have root own all below /etc/hylafax.  Also /var/spool/hylafax still belongs to uucp. With this uucp can still remove binaries from e.g. /var/spool/hylafax/bin and add his own there. For /var/spool/hylafax and below the default owner should be root, with exceptions being clearly defined  Also Leap 15.1 still needs a submission please :) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c8)  Axel Braun   2020-07-01 07:34:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c7)) > Thanks for the submission.

Category: security (moderate) Bug References: 1172731 CVE References: CVE-2020-8024 Sources used: openSUSE Leap 15.1 (src):    hylafax+-7.0.2-lp151.4.3.1 ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c12)  Axel Braun   2020-08-11 08:54:22 UTC  ``` I have submitted <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825727> containing hylafax 7.0.3 - this should contain the remaining fixes @Johannes - please review and close bug if satisfied ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c13)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-08-11 09:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1172731) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825731> Factory / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825733> 15.2 / hylafax+ <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/825734> 15.1 / hylafax+ ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c14)  Johannes Segitz   2020-09-09 07:06:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c12)) Thanks for the submissions. The permissions are better, but still not perfect. E.g. in /var/spool/hylafax/bin most files are now owned by root, but genfontmap.ps is not. Why? Postscript is a turing complete language and as this file is used in /usr/sbin/faxsetup this might be used to escalate privileges (didn't try it).  Please reorder the file list to have all files with default permissions (e.g. owned by root) at the top and then have the exeptions at the end. Currently it's changed several times, which introduces unnecessary risks and makes it hard to read.   Please check if   %{faxspool}/config/*   %{faxspool}/bin/dict/*   %{faxspool}/bin/genfontmap.ps   %{faxspool}/bin/auto-rotate.ps   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/dpsprinter.ps   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/cover.templ   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/lutRS18.pcf   %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/LiberationSans-25.pcf   %config(noreplace) %{faxspool}%{_sysconfdir}/dialrules* really need to be owned by uucp ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c15)  Axel Braun   2020-10-10 10:06:23 UTC  ``` I have regrouped the permissions and tested them on my local installation - hylafax still works :-) Please review  [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:DocB:branches:network:telephony/hylafax](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3ADocB%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/hylafax)+  before I submit.  Thanks! ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c16)  Johannes Segitz   2020-10-13 08:36:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Axel Braun from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c15)) So I had a look and saw that  %dir %{faxspool}/bin/dict is owned by uucp. This is problematic because some dict entries are eval'd and if uucp can edit them then this allows for code execution. E.g. bin/faxrcvd    78     if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then    79         eval echo "$DICTRECEIVEDFROM";    80     else    81         eval echo "$DICTNOTRECEIVED";    82     fi This by editing the file for the current locale in /var/spool/hylafax/bin/dict this allows to execute arbitrary code.   Please make %{faxspool}/bin/dict root owned  I'm pretty sure I can continue to find issues as long as I look ;) But given that fax maybe will not be dominant technology of the 21th century I think that's enough time spent here. So with that last change we can close this bug. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c17)  Axel Braun   2020-10-13 11:21:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Johannes Segitz from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=1172731#c16)) >  > Please make %{faxspool}/bin/dict root owned  It was actually...but mentioned in the uucp section as well. Looks like the last wins.   > I'm pretty sure I can continue to find issues as long as I look ;) But given > that fax maybe will not be dominant technology of the 21th century I think > that's enough time spent here.
