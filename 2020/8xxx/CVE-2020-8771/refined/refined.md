The provided content describes two distinct authentication bypass vulnerabilities, one in the InfiniteWP Client plugin and another in the WP Time Capsule plugin. Although the document does not explicitly state CVE numbers, it does reference the plugins and versions which are associated with the CVE-2020-8771.

**InfiniteWP Client Plugin (<= 1.9.4.4)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `iwp_mmb_set_request` function within the `init.php` file. Specifically, the `readd_site` and `add_site` actions do not have an authorization check in place and populate the `request_params` variable, which leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Authentication bypass due to missing authorization checks. The plugin allows login as any administrator without requiring a password.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to an administrator account on a WordPress site, allowing them to take complete control of the site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to send a POST request with a specific payload.
    *   The payload must be encoded using JSON, then Base64, and sent as raw data in the POST request.
    *   The payload must include the `iwp_action` parameter set to either `readd_site` or `add_site` and include the username of an administrator.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to know the username of an administrator on the target WordPress site. They can be an unauthenticated user, as long as they can send the crafted POST request.

**WP Time Capsule Plugin (<= 1.21.15)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `parse_request` function within `wptc-cron-functions.php`. This function calls `decode_server_request_wptc` which checks if the raw POST payload contains the string "IWP\_JSON\_PREFIX". If present, it calls `wptc_login_as_admin` which logs the attacker in as the first admin on the site without authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Authentication bypass due to improper input validation and direct usage of admin login function.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to an administrator account on a WordPress site.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to send a raw POST request.
    *   The body of the request must contain the string "IWP\_JSON\_PREFIX" to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending the crafted POST request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are difficult to block with standard firewall rules because the payloads don't appear overtly malicious.
*   Cloud-based firewalls may also have difficulty distinguishing between legitimate and malicious traffic.
*   Patches were released quickly by the developers of both plugins to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The content provides more technical details than the typical CVE description regarding the vulnerable code functions and payload structure.
