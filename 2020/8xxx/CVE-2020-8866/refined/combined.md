Version        : 2.0.8-2+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-8866
Debian Bug     : 955020

A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in the Form API
component of the Horde Application Framework.  An authenticated remote
attacker could use this flaw to upload arbitrary content to an arbitrary
writable location on the server and potentially execute code in the
context of the web server user.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.8-2+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-horde-form packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply

Hello,

A File Upload Arbitrary File Creation Vulnerability has been found in
Horde_Form. This vulnerability allows for specifying the name of the
temporary file that is created by Horde_Form when uploading a file
using Horde_Form's image support. While this allows a malicious user
to create an arbitrary file on the server with a known name, the file
creation is still restricted to the server's configured temporary
directory.

A fixed version of Horde_Form (2.0.20) has been released and everyone
is advised to upgrade.

This vulnerability was reported to us by Andrea Cardaci working with
Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
