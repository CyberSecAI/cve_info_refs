{
  "CVE-2020-8252": {
    "description": "libuv's realpath implementation incorrectly determined the buffer size which can result in a buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect buffer size calculation in libuv's realpath implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through the `fs.realpath.native` function of Node.js when it resolves a path longer than 256 bytes.",
       "Remote exploitation is possible if the application allows user-controlled paths or processes untrusted data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the input to `fs.realpath.native` to provide a long path name greater than 256 bytes."
  }
