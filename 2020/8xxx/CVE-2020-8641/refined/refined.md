```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application performs an unsanitized inclusion of a file based on the 'page_slug' parameter provided by the user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the lack of sanitization of the 'page_slug' parameter before including the file. The application appends '.php' to the given parameter, however, this can be bypassed using a null byte (%00).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the system, potentially leading to information disclosure or Remote Code Execution by including PHP files under attacker control.",
  "Attack vectors": "The 'page_slug' parameter is passed through a GET or POST request. The vulnerability can be triggered through a web request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker also needs to have knowledge about the location of files on the system to include them."
