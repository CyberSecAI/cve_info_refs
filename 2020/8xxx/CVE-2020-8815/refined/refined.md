Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8815:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper connection handling in the base connection handler of IKTeam BearFTP before version 0.3.1. The server's method of reading client input was vulnerable to a Slowloris attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Lack of Connection Handling:** The core issue lies in how the server handled incoming connections. It didn't properly manage the resources associated with each connection, which allowed an attacker to tie up server resources.
- **Vulnerable Input Handling:** The server was reading input character by character in a loop, and not reading a line at a time. This caused the server to hold onto the connection while waiting for a carriage return, which could be exploited by sending incomplete requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve a denial of service. By sending a large volume of small, incomplete packets (characteristic of a Slowloris attack), the attacker can exhaust the server's resources (threads), making it unresponsive to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is network-based and can be launched remotely.
- **Slowloris Attack:** The specific method of attack is a Slowloris attack, which involves sending partial HTTP requests or in this case incomplete FTP commands and keeping the connection open.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Networking Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send network packets and how TCP works, specifically with regards to leaving connections open.
- **No User Interaction or Authentication Required:** No special privileges, authentication, or user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.3.1 of BearFTP.
- **Mitigation:** The fix involved adding a configurable limit to the maximum number of threads the server spawns, mitigating the impact of slowloris attacks.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with high availability impact and low attack complexity. The attack vector is network-based and requires no privileges or user interaction.
- **EPSS Score:** The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score is 0.832% indicating that the vulnerability has a low probability of being exploited in the wild.
- **Code Fix:** The code fix involved replacing the character-by-character input reading with `sr.ReadLine()`, and implementing a maximum thread count.
- **Archival:** The repository was archived by the owner on Nov 1, 2023, and is now read-only.
- **Configurable Max Threads:** The fix implemented a `MaxThreads` setting in the configuration file, allowing the server operator to limit the number of threads used to handle connections.
