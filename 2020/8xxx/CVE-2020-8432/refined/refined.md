{
  "CVE-2020-8432": {
    "root_cause": "A double free vulnerability exists in the `do_rename_gpt_parts()` function within `cmd/gpt.c`. The `partition_list` is freed prematurely on line 702 when `ret` is less than 0 and then again in the `out:` label leading to the double free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double free"
    ],
    "impact": "Double freeing memory can lead to a write-what-where condition, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
         "Local"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable function with specific input that would cause the double free. No specific user interaction or privileges are explicitly mentioned, though some sources indicate a local attack vector may be required."
