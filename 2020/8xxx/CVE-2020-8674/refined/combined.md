### Dedicated Team

We have a dedicated team that is committed to and passionate about ensuring our products are safe and secure for their intended clinical use.  We have developed our products with cybersecurity controls integrated into the design, using a Common Cybersecurity Control Framework for Medical Devices which takes into consideration industry-leading standards, regulations, and guidance documents. While we have focused resources on developing safe and secure products, we know that the cybersecurity threat landscape changes every day. Baxter prides itself on being responsive and transparent with our customers about cybersecurity.

We are proud to have a global team of cybersecurity professionals that are dedicated to product security. Our team members are passionate about security and care about the safety of our patients. There are dedicated resources that support both the secure development of new products and the sustained maintenance of our fielded devices. We know cybersecurity is a dynamic field and we are committed to protecting our patients throughout the entire product lifecycle.

We are proud to have dedicated Business Information Security Officers (BISO) for each of our business units. The BISOs bring a wealth of experience and knowledge, to serve as a trusted advisor for our business and product leaders. This allows cybersecurity to be integrated into everything we do. There are also dedication cybersecurity engineers that support specific products during their development to work through the specific product security requirements. Last but not least, we have dedicated resources that conduct thorough cybersecurity risk management procedures that are consistent with our high-standard of product risk management.

### Cybersecurity Design

We have proudly developed a Cybersecurity Common Controls Framework for Medical Devices (C3FMD). The intent of the Cybersecurity Common Controls Framework (C3FMD) is to provide a consistent and common cybersecurity controls framework that addresses the above security concerns for medical device design and engineering, that is based on industry standards and best practices, is comprehensive in its security coverage, and that addresses the demands of a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. In the C3FMD, cybersecurity is driven first and foremost by patient health and safety concerns.

It is critical to ensure that any medical devices impacting patient health and safety are operated, deployed and managed in a safe, secure and reliable manner. This framework ensure that our products are developed consistently with cybersecurity capabilities built into the medical device. C3FMD covers the following key categories of controls: authentication, authorization, access controls, audit, and cryptography. This framework is a prescribed set of baseline cybersecurity controls which enhance the security posture and reduce the risk of compromise against target medical devices.

### Responsive & Transparent

We are committed providing transparent information to our customers about product security. In an effort to share information, we provide a Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2), from the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and the Healthcare Information and Management System Society, which contains important cybersecurity design features such as:

* Audit Controls
* Authorization
* Data Backup and Disaster Recovery
* Malware Detection/ Protection
* System and Application Hardening
* Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity

In addition to the information provided in the MDS2, we provide cybersecurity information in our user manuals and customer communications. For any further inquiries, customers can feel free to work with their sales or service representatives.

### Partnerships

The healthcare ecosystem is increasingly complex and interconnected. In order to protect patients and ensure our products are safe and secure, the entire healthcare industry has to work closely together. To achieve greater security, we value the relationships and partnerships it maintains across the healthcare ecosystem. We are proud of all the thought leaders that make up our product security team. There are several organizations that we work with to gather and share cyber information, such as:

* National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (NH-ISAC)

## Treck IP stacks contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#257161

Original Release Date: 2020-06-16 | Last Revised: 2022-09-20

---

### Overview

Treck IP stack implementations for embedded systems are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities was researched and reported by JSOF, who calls them [Ripple20](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

### Description

Treck IP network stack software is designed for and used in a variety of embedded systems. The software can be licensed and integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked library. Treck IP software contains multiple vulnerabilities, most of which are caused by [memory management bugs](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152142). For more details on the vulnerabilities introduced by these bugs, see Treck's  [Vulnerability Response Information](https://treck.com/vulnerability-response-information/) and JSOF's [Ripple20 advisory](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

Historically-related KASAGO TCP/IP middleware from Zuken Elmic (formerly Elmic Systems) is also affected by some of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities likely affect industrial control systems and medical devices. Please see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-20-168-01](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01) for more information.

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities will vary due to the combination of build and runtime options used while developing different embedded systems. This diversity of implementations and the lack of supply chain visibility has exasperated the problem of accurately assessing the impact of these vulnerabilities. In summary, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to cause a denial of service, disclose information, or execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

Update to the latest stable version of Treck IP stack software (6.0.1.67 or later). Please contact Treck at security@treck.com. Downstream users of embedded systems that incorporate Treck IP stacks should contact their embedded system vendor.

#### Block anomalous IP traffic

Consider blocking network attacks via deep packet inspection. In some cases, modern switches, routers, and firewalls will drop malformed packets with no additional configuration. It is recommended that such security features are not disabled. Below is a list of possible mitigations that can be applied as appropriate to your network environment.

* Normalize or reject IP fragmented packets (IP Fragments) if not supported in your environment
* Disable or block IP tunneling, both IPv6-in-IPv4 or IP-in-IP tunneling if not required
* Block IP source routing and any IPv6 deprecated features like routing headers (see also [VU#267289](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/267289))
* Enforce TCP inspection and reject malformed TCP packets
* Block unused ICMP control messages such MTU Update and Address Mask updates
* Normalize DNS through a secure recursive server or application layer firewall
* Ensure that you are using reliable OSI layer 2 equipment (Ethernet)
* Provide DHCP/DHCPv6 security with feature like DHCP snooping
* Disable or block IPv6 multicast if not used in switching infrastructure

Further recommendations are available [here](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/recommendations.md).

#### Detect anomalous IP traffic

Suricata IDS has built-in decoder-event rules that can be customized to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. See the rule below for an example. A larger set of selected [vu-257161.rules](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/vu-257161.rules) are available from the CERT/CC Github repository.

`#IP-in-IP tunnel with fragments`

`alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"VU#257161:CVE-2020-11896, CVE-2020-11900 Fragments inside IP-in-IP tunnel https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161"; ip_proto:4; fragbits:M; sid:1367257161; rev:1;)`

### Acknowledgements

Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman of JSOF https://jsof-tech.com researched and reported these vulnerabilities. Treck worked closely with us and other stakeholders to coordinate the disclosure of these vulnerabilities.

#### Vendor Statement

Green Hills Software LLCâs GHnetâ¢ v2 network stack is based on the network stack from Treck Inc. Treck informed Green Hills Software of multiple vulnerabilities in its network stack, which were found by a third party.

While GHnet v2 is based on Treckâs network stack, the two are not identical. Green Hills Software has made many improvements, added new features, and fixed bugs in the product. Because of these improvements and INTEGRITYâs separation kernel architecture, the impact of these vulnerabilities on GHnet v2 is far less severe.

Green Hills Software has and will continue to advocate for running middleware, driver, and application code in partitioned virtual address spaces, rather than in the kernel. The INTEGRITY Real-Time Operating System was designed to provide isolation between applications and the kernel, protecting the rest of the system if an application fails or misbehaves. Due to the isolation provided by INTEGRITY, running the GHnet v2 stack in a virtual address space significantly reduces the impact of these vulnerabilities. Green Hills Software strongly recommends that the GHnet v2 network stack, all other middleware, and all application code be placed in separate virtual address spaces.

Green Hills Software will include fixes for these vulnerabilities in future releases of GHnet v2, and is making patches available to customers on previous releases. If you have questions about how these vulnerabilities may affect your system, please contact your Green Hills Software sales representative, or contact Green Hills Software Technical Support.

## Treck IP stacks contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#257161

Original Release Date: 2020-06-16 | Last Revised: 2022-09-20

---

### Overview

Treck IP stack implementations for embedded systems are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities was researched and reported by JSOF, who calls them [Ripple20](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

### Description

Treck IP network stack software is designed for and used in a variety of embedded systems. The software can be licensed and integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked library. Treck IP software contains multiple vulnerabilities, most of which are caused by [memory management bugs](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152142). For more details on the vulnerabilities introduced by these bugs, see Treck's  [Vulnerability Response Information](https://treck.com/vulnerability-response-information/) and JSOF's [Ripple20 advisory](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/).

Historically-related KASAGO TCP/IP middleware from Zuken Elmic (formerly Elmic Systems) is also affected by some of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities likely affect industrial control systems and medical devices. Please see ICS-CERT Advisory [ICSA-20-168-01](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-168-01) for more information.

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities will vary due to the combination of build and runtime options used while developing different embedded systems. This diversity of implementations and the lack of supply chain visibility has exasperated the problem of accurately assessing the impact of these vulnerabilities. In summary, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to cause a denial of service, disclose information, or execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

Update to the latest stable version of Treck IP stack software (6.0.1.67 or later). Please contact Treck at security@treck.com. Downstream users of embedded systems that incorporate Treck IP stacks should contact their embedded system vendor.

#### Block anomalous IP traffic

Consider blocking network attacks via deep packet inspection. In some cases, modern switches, routers, and firewalls will drop malformed packets with no additional configuration. It is recommended that such security features are not disabled. Below is a list of possible mitigations that can be applied as appropriate to your network environment.

* Normalize or reject IP fragmented packets (IP Fragments) if not supported in your environment
* Disable or block IP tunneling, both IPv6-in-IPv4 or IP-in-IP tunneling if not required
* Block IP source routing and any IPv6 deprecated features like routing headers (see also [VU#267289](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/267289))
* Enforce TCP inspection and reject malformed TCP packets
* Block unused ICMP control messages such MTU Update and Address Mask updates
* Normalize DNS through a secure recursive server or application layer firewall
* Ensure that you are using reliable OSI layer 2 equipment (Ethernet)
* Provide DHCP/DHCPv6 security with feature like DHCP snooping
* Disable or block IPv6 multicast if not used in switching infrastructure

Further recommendations are available [here](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/recommendations.md).

#### Detect anomalous IP traffic

Suricata IDS has built-in decoder-event rules that can be customized to detect attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. See the rule below for an example. A larger set of selected [vu-257161.rules](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/vu-257161/vu-257161.rules) are available from the CERT/CC Github repository.

`#IP-in-IP tunnel with fragments`

`alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"VU#257161:CVE-2020-11896, CVE-2020-11900 Fragments inside IP-in-IP tunnel https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161"; ip_proto:4; fragbits:M; sid:1367257161; rev:1;)`

### Acknowledgements

Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman of JSOF https://jsof-tech.com researched and reported these vulnerabilities. Treck worked closely with us and other stakeholders to coordinate the disclosure of these vulnerabilities.

#### Vendor Statement

Green Hills Software LLCâs GHnetâ¢ v2 network stack is based on the network stack from Treck Inc. Treck informed Green Hills Software of multiple vulnerabilities in its network stack, which were found by a third party.

While GHnet v2 is based on Treckâs network stack, the two are not identical. Green Hills Software has made many improvements, added new features, and fixed bugs in the product. Because of these improvements and INTEGRITYâs separation kernel architecture, the impact of these vulnerabilities on GHnet v2 is far less severe.

Green Hills Software has and will continue to advocate for running middleware, driver, and application code in partitioned virtual address spaces, rather than in the kernel. The INTEGRITY Real-Time Operating System was designed to provide isolation between applications and the kernel, protecting the rest of the system if an application fails or misbehaves. Due to the isolation provided by INTEGRITY, running the GHnet v2 stack in a virtual address space significantly reduces the impact of these vulnerabilities. Green Hills Software strongly recommends that the GHnet v2 network stack, all other middleware, and all application code be placed in separate virtual address spaces.

Green Hills Software will include fixes for these vulnerabilities in future releases of GHnet v2, and is making patches available to customers on previous releases. If you have questions about how these vulnerabilities may affect your system, please contact your Green Hills Software sales representative, or contact Green Hills Software Technical Support.

###### **Apache Log4j CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability**

Digi is currently investigating the impact throughout our product line. We currently have not discovered any impact at this time. We will continue to work diligently, and update as soon as we come to a conclusion across the organization.

Jun 14, 2021
###### **FragAttacks - WiFi Fregmentation and Aggregation Attacks**

At this time, Digi is still reviewing these attacks and how they impact our devices. From the nature of the attacks, we do expect that Digi devices will be impacted.

However, it is critical to note that even with these attacks, it has always been DIgi's policy and suggestions that network communication should never rely on the protections and standards of the data layers (WiFi/BlueTooth). Many of these are implemented in HW and can be difficult to change. If good network practices are used, (TLS/Certificates etc), then these vulnerabilities do not lead to any real impact. These vulnerabilites can only become impactful IF other flaws or issues are present.

It is Digi's intent to address these issues so that we preserve our defense in depth strategy to security in our products. Due to the complexity of these issues, we believe we will be able to address these by Q4 of 2021 or sooner if possible.
