Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It is located in the "Strong Testimonials" WordPress plugin.
- Specifically, the `custom[client_name]` and `custom[company_name]` parameters within the client details section of the testimonial creation/edit interface are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `custom[client_name]` and `custom[company_name]` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored in the database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of adequate input sanitization for the specified parameters, allowing the injection of script tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies, which can allow an attacker to hijack user sessions.
    - Stealing login credentials by redirecting users to fake login forms.
    - Performing arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim (if the victim is logged in).
    - Keystroke logging and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to inject the malicious payload into the `custom[client_name]` and `custom[company_name]` fields when adding or editing a testimonial through the WordPress admin panel.
- The XSS payload is triggered when the testimonial is displayed on the site (front-end), and in the "All Testimonials" page in the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add or edit testimonials within the WordPress administration panel, which implies having at least contributor level access. This is generally not a public facing form, and requires the attacker to be logged into the backend.
- This could be achieved by:
  - Being a malicious administrator/editor/contributor.
  - Compromising an account with the required privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Strong Testimonials plugin versions 2.40.0 and below.
- A fix was released in version 2.40.1 on January 25, 2020.
- The vulnerability was reported to the Strong Testimonials team on January 23, 2020.
- It is recommended to update the plugin to the latest version to mitigate this vulnerability.
