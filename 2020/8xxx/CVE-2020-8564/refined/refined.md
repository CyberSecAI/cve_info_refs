  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability stems from logging secrets within a malformed docker configuration file when the Kubernetes log level is set to 4 or higher. This can lead to the exposure of pull secrets or other sensitive registry credentials.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the exposure of docker config file contents, including secrets, when processing a malformed file under verbose logging (level 4 or higher) in Kubernetes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Exposure of sensitive data (secrets) in logs.",
        "Improper handling of malformed docker configuration files.",
        "Lack of sanitization of log output when processing secrets."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who gains access to the logs can obtain pull secrets or other sensitive registry credentials, potentially compromising the security of the Kubernetes cluster and associated container images.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker needs to access the Kubernetes cluster's log files.",
          "The docker config file needs to be malformed for the vulnerability to be triggered.",
           "The Kubernetes logging level needs to be set to 4 or higher."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to access Kubernetes logs and knowledge about how to trigger the conditions that lead to secret exposure. An attacker can be a malicious insider or an external attacker that has gained access to the clusterâ€™s logging system"
