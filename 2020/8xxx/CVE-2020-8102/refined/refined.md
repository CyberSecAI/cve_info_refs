- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the Safepay browser component. Specifically, insufficient URL sanitization and validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Safepay browser fails to properly sanitize and validate URLs, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An external, specially crafted webpage can execute remote commands within the Safepay Utility process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data compromise, and system instability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious web page and enticing a user to visit it using the vulnerable Safepay browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and persuade a user to open it using the vulnerable Bitdefender Safepay browser.
