{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `ecall_restore` function within the Asylo SGX primitives, where it fails to properly validate if the output pointer and its length are located outside of the enclave. Specifically, the code checks if `output_len` which is of type `uint64_t`, is outside the enclave using `sizeof(uint64_t)`, but does not validate the location of the memory pointed to by `output` with the size specified by `*output_len`. This can lead to out-of-enclave memory corruption if the output pointer is maliciously located inside the enclave memory, because the enclave will write to memory it should not have access to.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient validation of output pointer location",
        "Potential out-of-enclave memory corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can corrupt enclave memory by providing a carefully crafted output pointer that resides within the enclave's protected memory space. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches within the enclave.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can manipulate the `output` pointer and `output_len` arguments of the `ecall_restore` function, which is called from outside the enclave.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to call the `ecall_restore` function with arbitrary input and output pointers."
