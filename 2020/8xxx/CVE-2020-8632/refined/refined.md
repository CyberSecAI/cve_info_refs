{
  "CVE-2020-8632": {
    "Description": "In cloud-init through 19.4, rand_user_password in cloudinit/config/cc_set_passwords.py has a small default pwlen value, which makes it easier for attackers to guess passwords.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default password length used by `rand_user_password` was too short, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Insufficient password length"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could potentially guess passwords generated by cloud-init, gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Brute-force attack against the generated passwords.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the system where the password was generated or obtain the generated password somehow."
