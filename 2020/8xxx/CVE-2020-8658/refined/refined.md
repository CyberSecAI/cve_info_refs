Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2020-8658 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a missing or incorrect implementation of anti-CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the "Htaccess by BestWebSoft" WordPress plugin. The plugin uses a nonce for security, but it fails to validate it correctly, allowing attackers to bypass this protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability. This allows an attacker to perform actions on the website on behalf of a logged-in user without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Insufficient Nonce Validation:**  The plugin uses a nonce, intended to be a one-time use token, to protect forms, but it does not validate it properly. This allows an attacker to provide an arbitrary value for the nonce, effectively negating its security benefits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary .htaccess File Modification:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to arbitrarily modify the .htaccess file.
- **Website Control:** By modifying the .htaccess file, an attacker can gain significant control over the website, potentially leading to various outcomes:
    - **Website redirection:** Redirect users to malicious sites.
    - **Denial of service:** Cause the website to malfunction or become unavailable.
    - **Malware injection:** Inject malicious code or scripts.
    - **Full site compromise:**  In some scenarios, complete control of the website could be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in WordPress administrator into visiting a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker.
- **Form Submission:** The malicious webpage contains a form that automatically submits a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable plugin's endpoint. The request includes attacker-defined data that will modify the .htaccess file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target User Needs to Be Logged in:**  The attacker does not need administrative credentials, but the target user must be logged into the WordPress admin panel for the exploit to work.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use some form of social engineering to get the targeted administrator to visit the malicious page.
- **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
