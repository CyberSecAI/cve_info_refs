[`d7ae673`](/bradyvercher/gistpress/commit/d7ae673996d536ea06c25ff22e754f212fbe3f11)

* Sanitized the `id` attribute passed to the `[gist]` shortcode. This fixes an XSS vulnerability that could be exploited by untrusted contributors on multi-author sites. Thanks to [@cornerpirate](https://github.com/cornerpirate) for disclosing responsibly.
* Added an XML encoding declaration to load Gist content as UTF-8 ([#76](https://github.com/bradyvercher/gistpress/issues/76)).
* Removed `DOCTYPE`, `html` and `body` elements added by DOMDocument.
* Ensured the $gistpress global exists and is an instance of `GistPress` before running ([#72](https://github.com/bradyvercher/gistpress/issues/72)). Props [@robneu](https://github.com/robneu)
* Added `.editorconfig` file.
* Fixed some code standards.
* Updated change log.
* Added Issue and Pull Request templates.
* Move screenshot into `assets-repo`.
* Removed / updated author details.
* Updated "Tested up to" to 5.3.
