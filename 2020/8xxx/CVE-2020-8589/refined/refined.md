Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-8589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists in Clustered Data ONTAP due to insufficient access control, allowing unauthorized tenant users to potentially discover information they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Sensitive Information Disclosure: The core weakness is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, specifically the names of other Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) and filenames on those SVMs.
- Insufficient Access Control: The vulnerability stems from inadequate access controls that fail to restrict tenant users' visibility to resources they shouldn't be able to see.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The specific information exposed would be names of other Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) and filenames on those SVMs.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through network access (AV:A) with local access (PR:L) using an authenticated tenant user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be a tenant user within the affected system.
-   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access (PR:L) to the system. No specific user interface interaction (UI:N) is required for exploitation.
-   The attacker doesn't need any special level of privilege other than that of a tenant user.
