Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-8285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a recursive function call within libcurl's FTP wildcard matching functionality, specifically when a callback function set using `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` returns `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP` to skip processing a file or directory entry during the listing process.
*   When this occurs repeatedly over a sufficient number of entries, the recursive calls can exhaust stack space leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Exhaustion:** The core weakness is uncontrolled recursion due to a flaw in how libcurl handles `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP` within the file/directory processing loop.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** While not directly stated as a weakness, the vulnerability arises because the recursive logic doesn't account for a scenario where many directory entries are skipped with `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP`, leading to excessive stack usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to stack overflow. When the stack is exhausted, the libcurl application will crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious FTP Server:** An attacker controls a malicious FTP server which can send a directory listing with a large number of entries and control the directory entries returned to repeatedly call the `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback and skip processing the files/directories in a crafted way that leads to stack exhaustion.
*   **Abuse of `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH`:** The vulnerability is exploitable when using libcurl's wildcard matching functionality (specified with `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` option) with a custom `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over FTP Server:** The attacker must be able to set up and control the behavior of an FTP server that a client using a vulnerable version of libcurl will connect to.
*   **Ability to Trigger `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH`:** Attacker needs the application to use `CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH` and an appropriately programmed `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback to handle remote directory entries.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions**

*   The stack overflow occurs due to a recursive call within an internal libcurl function that handles the "skip" response from the `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback. Instead of using a loop to iterate through items, it would recursively call the processing function again, each time adding a new stack frame.
*   The recursive nature of this logic means that if the callback always returns `CURL_CHUNK_BGN_FUNC_SKIP` (to skip entries), and there is a high number of directory entries, stack space will eventually run out.
*   The vulnerability is hard to leverage for exploitation beyond DoS. While it is theoretically possible to overwrite the stack, it's difficult to control the data used to overwrite the stack since content of remote directories is not stored on the stack.
*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered when libcurl is built to use OpenSSL as a TLS backend.

**Mitigation and Fixes**
*   The fix was to rewrite the internal function to use a loop instead of a recursive call for skipping the directory entries, which prevents stack overflows.
*   The issue has been fixed in libcurl version 7.74.0.
*   One can prevent this issue by disabling FTP wildcard use (`CURLOPT_WILDCARDMATCH`).
*   Another possible workaround is by creating a `CURLOPT_CHUNK_BGN_FUNCTION` callback that doesn't do multiple skips, thus limiting stack growth.

**Affected Products:**
*   libcurl versions 7.21.0 up to and including 7.73.0 are affected.
*   Specific products mentioned:
    *   Debian 9 stretch and Fedora 32/33 versions of libcurl.
    *   macOS Mojave and Catalina versions of libcurl.
    *   Various Oracle products that bundle vulnerable versions of libcurl.
    *   NetApp products that have embedded libcurl.
    *   Fujitsu M10-1, M10-4, M10-4S, M12-1, M12-2, M12-2S Servers
*   Products using vulnerable versions of libcurl are advised to upgrade to version 7.74.0 or later.
