  "CVE-2020-8835": {
    "description": "In the Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, the bpf verifier (kernel/bpf/verifier.c) did not properly restrict the register bounds for 32-bit operations, leading to out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory. The vulnerability also affects the Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, as the introducing commit was backported to that branch. This vulnerability was fixed in 5.6.1, 5.5.14, and 5.4.29.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly calculate register bounds for certain 32-bit operations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper restriction of register bounds for 32-bit operations in the bpf verifier.",
        "Out-of-bounds read and write in kernel memory due to incorrect range assumption in `__reg_bound_offset32()`."
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could use this vulnerability to expose sensitive information (kernel memory) or gain administrative privileges. This can lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attack.",
        "Exploitation of the bpf verifier through crafted BPF programs."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to load BPF programs can exploit this vulnerability, potentially gaining root privileges. Unprivileged users may be able to access the bpf(2) syscall by default, depending on the kernel version and configuration. Secure boot with kernel lockdown mitigates this vulnerability by blocking BPF program loading."

    "affected_versions": [
      "Linux kernel 5.5.0 and newer, up to 5.6.0.",
      "Linux 5.4 stable series, starting with v5.4.7, up to 5.4.28."

        "Set the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl to 1.",

      ],
        "details": "The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged BPF program loading using `sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1` or by systems that use secure boot, where kernel lockdown blocks BPF loading. The fix involves reverting commit 581738a681b6, as it contained incorrect assumptions about register bounds after jmp32 instructions."
