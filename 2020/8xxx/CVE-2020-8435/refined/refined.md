Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8435

**Root Cause:**
- The `form_id` field in the Registration Magic plugin does not properly validate user input before processing it in backend SQL queries. Specifically, the plugin uses string concatenation to build SQL queries instead of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authenticated Blind SQL Injection:**  The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `form_id` parameter. This specific vulnerability is blind, meaning the attacker does not receive direct output from the database.
- **Missing Prepared Statements:** The code uses direct string concatenation to build SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can inject a `sleep()` command in the SQL query to cause the database to delay response, making the server unresponsive.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for information disclosure if the attacker can craft more sophisticated SQL injection queries to extract sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `rm_form_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in with sufficient privileges in WordPress to access the vulnerable admin functionality. This typically means an administrator or an editor role would be required.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker has to know the vulnerable parameter to exploit.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable parameter is `rm_form_id`.
- The SQL query is executed when accessing the analytics page with the vulnerable parameter: `http://192.168.0.31/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rm_analytics_show_form&rm_form_id=(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)&rm_tr=30`
- The SQL query without prepared statements is shown as `SELECT \`browser_name\`, COUNT(*) AS \`count\` FROM \`wp_rm_stats\` WHERE \`form_id\` = '(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)' AND \`browser_name\` IN`
- Multiple files within the plugin's code are identified as generating SQL queries without prepared statements, including `plus/chronos/libs/query_builder.php`, `plus/chronos/libs/rm_chronos.php`, `plus/chronos/libs/task_model.php`, `includes/class_rm_activator.php`, `includes/class_rm_dbmanager.php`, `includes/class_rm_table_tech.php`, `includes/class_rm_migrator.php`, and `services/class_rm_services.php`.
- The plugin version affected is 4.6.0.0.

**Remediation:**
- The vendor advises to update to the latest version of the Registration Magic plugin to fix the vulnerability.
