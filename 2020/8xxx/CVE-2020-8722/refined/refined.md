Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8722:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a subsystem of affected Intel Server Boards, Systems, and Compute Modules.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, meaning that the system attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to escalate their privileges on the system.
*  **Arbitrary code execution**: The vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Though not specifically mentioned, buffer overflows could potentially also lead to a denial-of-service condition in the vulnerable component.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the targeted system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Privileged user:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the targeted system.
*   **Local access:** The attacker requires local access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Intel Server Boards, Server Systems and Compute Modules before version 1.59.
* The CVSS score is 7.5 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
* The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting Intel products, as detailed in the Intel advisory INTEL-SA-00384.

The NetApp advisory also states that the vulnerability exists within the Intel firmware. NetApp products such as "NetApp Cloud Backup" and "NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage" are affected. No workarounds are available.
