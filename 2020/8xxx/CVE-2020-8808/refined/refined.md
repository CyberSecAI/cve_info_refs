{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CorsairLLAccess64.sys/CorsairLLAccess32.sys driver allows local non-privileged users to read and write arbitrary physical memory locations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The driver has insufficient access control, allowing low-integrity level processes to perform privileged memory operations. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the usage of the `MmMapIoSpace` function call, which permits mapping of physical memory to user space.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows local non-privileged users to gain `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges, effectively achieving complete control over the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring a non-privileged user account on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system. No specific privileges are needed beyond a normal user account, including low-integrity processes."
