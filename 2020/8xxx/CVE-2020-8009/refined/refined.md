Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8009

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in MOTU AVB devices. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the URL, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is the ability to manipulate the application using `../` sequences in the URL to access arbitrary files on the device's file system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the URL input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd`, which may contain user account information, potentially leading to further compromise of the device or network.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Access to sensitive files could reveal further vulnerabilities or allow for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating the URL by appending directory traversal sequences such as `../`.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web server, which is running on port 1280.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the MOTU AVB device. The content recommends removing any external network access.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to construct HTTP requests with directory traversal sequences.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability or provided a patch or fix.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Secure Network Technologies (SNT).
*   SNT recommends removing any external network access to the affected devices as a mitigation.
