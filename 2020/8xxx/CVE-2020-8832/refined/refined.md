Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2020-8832 is an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability, CVE-2019-14615. The initial fix for CVE-2019-14615 did not fully clear residual context state on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. This incomplete fix left a potential information leak. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to the i915 graphics driver not properly resetting the hardware state after a context switch, leading to the possibility of residual data being exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability within the Intel i915 graphics driver in the Linux kernel. This allows for an information leak.  The driver fails to properly clear the context state after a context switch, meaning data from a previous process/context may be accessible by a subsequent process using the same GPU.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to expose sensitive information from the GPU's memory.  Specifically an attacker can leak data from the shared GPU memory that was previously used by another process/context.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.  Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to access the GPU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to run malicious code.
*   **GPU Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Intel i915 graphics driver, which typically means having the ability to execute graphics related commands.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves backporting several commits related to the initialization and state management of the i915 driver from newer kernel versions (4.16 and later) to the affected 4.15 kernel. These commits ensure the correct reset of the hardware state after a context switch. The specific commits include:
    *   `drm/i915: Use same test for eviction and submitting kernel context`
    *   `drm/i915: Define an engine class enum for the uABI`
    *   `drm/i915: Force the switch to the i915->kernel_context`
    *   `drm/i915: Move GT powersaving init to i915_gem_init()`
    *   `drm/i915: Move intel_init_clock_gating() to i915_gem_init()`
    *  `drm/i915: Inline intel_modeset_gem_init()`
    *   `drm/i915: Mark the context state as dirty/written`
    *   `drm/i915: Record the default hw state after reset upon load`
*   The vulnerability specifically affects Ubuntu's 4.15 kernel series (Bionic), while Xenial (4.4), Disco (5.0), Eoan (5.3), and Focal (5.4) are not affected by this incomplete fix issue.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit exists which can be used to verify the vulnerability: `<https://github.com/HE-Wenjian/iGPU-Leak>`.
*   NetApp products that incorporate a vulnerable Linux Kernel are also affected by this vulnerability.
*   The fix for this issue was released in Ubuntu as part of USN-4302-1.
