Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8518:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the Horde_Data library processes CSV data. Specifically, a flaw in the code allows for the execution of malicious code embedded within CSV files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The lack of proper sanitization of CSV data allowed for arbitrary code execution

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted CSV file to a Horde application that uses the vulnerable Horde_Data library to process CSV data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability in most cases.
- If guest access is enabled for an application that supports CSV data import and for a specific resource in the application, unauthenticated users can also exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- A fix for the vulnerability was implemented three years before the public disclosure but wasn't released.
- The fix was released in Horde_Data version 2.1.5.
- The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Cardaci through the SSD Secure Disclosure program.
- Development versions of Horde were not affected by this vulnerability.
