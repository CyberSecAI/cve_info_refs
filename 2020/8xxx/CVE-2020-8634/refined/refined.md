Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the unsafe default permissions set by Wing FTP Server when modifying files through its HTTP(S) interface. Specifically, the server uses an incorrect umask when writing to files via this interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unsafe Umask:** Wing FTP Server does not apply the correct umask when modifying files using the HTTP(S) interface, resulting in files being saved with world-readable and world-writable permissions (666). The expected behavior is to use the defined default of "644".
-   **Incorrect File Modification Permissions:**  When modifying files via the HTTP(S) interface, the software changes the file permissions to 666, which are world-readable and world-writable. It also sets the owner and group of the file to "root".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By modifying sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, or `/etc/sudoers` via the HTTP(S) interface, a low-privilege user can gain root access. This is due to the world-writable permissions on these files after modification, allowing any user to alter them.
-   **Compromised System Integrity:** The modification of sensitive system files can compromise the integrity of the system, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions.
-   **Confidentiality Breach:** The ability to read files like `/etc/shadow` allows attackers to access password hashes.
-   **Lateral Movement:** In combination with other vulnerabilities, this allows attackers to escalate privileges and forge user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP(S) Interface:** The primary attack vector is the Wing FTP Server's HTTP(S) web interface.
-   **File Modification:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user (even a lower-privileged one) modifies a file through the HTTP(S) interface.
-   **Symbolic Link following:** The ability of the server to follow symbolic links allows attackers to create symlinks to sensitive files, allowing them to gain access via the HTTP(S) interface for modification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Command Execution:**  An attacker needs the ability to execute commands or have terminal access to the server as any user.
-   **Wing FTP Account:** An attacker needs a user account on the Wing FTP Server.
-   **Access to HTTP(S) interface:** Attacker needs to access the web interface.
-   **File Modification Permissions:** Attacker needs read, write and delete privileges.
