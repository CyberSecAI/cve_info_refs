Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8463:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an authorization bypass in the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA). The appliance performs a check to allow anonymous access to a limited set of paths, such as the login page. However, this check only verifies the beginning of the requested path, leading to a bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability lies in how the IWSVA verifies access to specific paths for anonymous users. By sending a request to a path like `/logon.jsp/../<actual path>`, the initial check passes, but then the server accesses the actual path allowing an attacker to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities (specifically CVE-2020-8464) could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to restricted parts of the system.
- Specifically, the combination of the authorization bypass and the authentication bypass allowed the attacker to add a new admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request path to the IWSVA web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the IWSVA web interface.
- While the authorization bypass alone may not be critical, it acts as an important enabler for other vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-8464.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a set of multiple critical vulnerabilities affecting IWSVA.
- The provided document highlights that the authorization bypass was not investigated further on its own but was used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities for exploitation.
- The vendor released a patch to fix this vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions that the IWSVA version tested was IWSVA 6.5 SP2 EN Patch 4 Build 1844 with Patch cpb1852 but the vulnerability exists in versions prior to  IWSVA 6.5 SP2 EN Patch 4 Build 1919.
