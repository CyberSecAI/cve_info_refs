The provided content describes a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability in the School ERP System, specifically referencing CVE-2020-8505.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection in the School ERP System's web application. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can perform unintended actions on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper CSRF mitigation, such as anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms, on the endpoints responsible for adding and deleting administrative users.
- **Lack of input validation:** The provided exploit suggests that the application does not properly validate the request parameters which are needed to add a user or delete a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Adding a new Admin User:** An attacker can create a new administrator account, which grants full control over the system.
- **Deleting an Arbitrary User:** An attacker can delete any existing user account from the system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a complete compromise of the application and the data it manages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through malicious HTML forms.
- These forms are designed to make requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
- The victim's browser automatically sends the required cookies/authentication tokens for the legitimate session
- When the authenticated user visits a page containing the malicious form it triggers the request, exploiting the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require direct access to the victim's machine or the application server.
- The attacker needs to host or inject the malicious HTML form into a site visited by a logged-in user of the School ERP System.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints to craft the requests.
