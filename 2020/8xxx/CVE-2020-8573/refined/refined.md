  "CVE-2020-8573": {
    "summary": "The NetApp HCI H610C, H615C and H610S Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) are shipped with a documented default account and password that should be changed during the initial node setup. During upgrades to Element 11.8 and 12.0 or the Compute Firmware Bundle 12.2.92 the BMC account password on the H610C, H615C and H610S platforms is reset to the default documented value which could allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the BMC account password being reset to the default documented value during upgrades to Element 11.8 and 12.0 or the Compute Firmware Bundle 12.2.92.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of default credentials",
      "Unprotected reset of administrator credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vector": "Remote network access",
