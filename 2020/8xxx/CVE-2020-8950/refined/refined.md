Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2020-8950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure file handling by the AMD User Experience Program Launcher service. Specifically, the service processes files placed in specific directories (`upload`, `temp`) within `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC`, and moves them to the `send` directory after compressing them. The service performs file operations using SYSTEM privileges, but the directories involved have weak permissions, allowing regular users to create files, which can be leveraged using symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure File Move:** The service moves files from the `upload` directory to the `temp` directory, and then to the `send` directory with SYSTEM privileges after compressing them into `.gz` format.
2.  **Weak Directory Permissions:** The directories `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC`, `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\upload`, `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\temp`, and `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\send` are accessible with Full Control by the built-in `Users` group. This allows users to create files, manipulate their content, and create symbolic links within these directories.
3.  **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** During the file move operation, the service doesn't validate the target path. An attacker can create a symbolic link within one of the directories pointing to a privileged file/location. When the service moves the file, it will write data to the linked location with SYSTEM privileges.
4.  **Static UUID:** The service uses a static UUID (A39F24CA-A49E-43E1-B078-2FE6809835F2) when creating the temporary file path within the `temp` directory. This static UUID can be easily predicted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a low-privileged user can gain SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write arbitrary data to any location on the file system where the user has write access to create the symlink, effectively achieving privileged file write.
*   **Code Execution:** Using a DLL hijack technique (UsoDllLoader), it's possible to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by overwriting a DLL loaded by a system process.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **File Creation:** Create a file in the `upload` directory (`C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\upload`) with arbitrary data.
2.  **Symbolic Link Creation:** Create a symbolic link in the `temp` directory (`C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\temp`) or `send` directory (`C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\send`), which is created during the file moving process that points to a privileged file or location.
3.  **Service Trigger:** Restart the AMD User Experience Program Launcher service (or reboot). The service will move the created file to the symbolic link's target, effectively writing to the target location using SYSTEM privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system with a user account, including guest accounts.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to write to the directories  `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC`, `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\upload`, and `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\temp`, and `C:\ProgramData\AMD\PPC\send`.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:**  The attacker must be able to create symbolic links, which requires certain permissions or the use of tools like CreateSymlink.exe from symboliclink-testing-tools.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog posts outline two different attack vectors, the first one leveraging the `send` folder, and the second leveraging the `upload` and `temp` folders, after the first one was fixed in the newest version of the software.
*   The vulnerability is present in the AMD User Experience Program Launcher from Radeon Software.
*   The attacker can overwrite system files or DLLs to achieve system-level code execution by using the write primitive of the symlink.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code utilizes  UsoDllLoader to achieve code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
