Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-8744:

**Root Cause:** Improper initialization in the subsystem for specific versions of Intel CSME, TXE and SPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper initialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Escalation of privileges.
*   Disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Modification of data.
*   Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Privileged user (High Privileges required for CSME/TXE/SPS vulnerability, low privileges required for the BIOS vulnerability in the Siemens advisory).

**Specifics from different sources:**

*   **NetApp Advisory NTAP-20201113-0005**: Lists CVE-2020-8744 as one of the vulnerabilities related to Intel TXE, and notes that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).  The CVSS score is 7.2 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.  NetApp Cloud Backup is listed as affected with no fix planned.
*   **NetApp Advisory NTAP-20201113-0004**: Lists CVE-2020-8744 as related to Intel SPS. It states that successful exploitation of this could lead to the same impacts as listed in -0005. It explicitly states that CVE-2020-8744 Affects: None. The CVSS score is 7.2 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.
*   **NetApp Advisory NTAP-20201113-0002**: Lists CVE-2020-8744 as one of the vulnerabilities related to Intel CSME, and notes that successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).  The CVSS score is 7.2 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N. NetApp Cloud Backup is listed as affected with no fix planned.
*   **Siemens Advisory SSA-501073**: States that CVE-2020-8744 is related to "Improper initialization in subsystem for Intel(R) CSME versions before 12.0.70, 13.0.40, 13.30.10, 14.0.45 and 14.5.25, Intel(R) TXE versions before 4.0.30 Intel(R) SPS versions before E3_05.01.04.200" and it allows a privileged user to potentially escalate privileges via local access. The CVSS score is 7.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C. The associated CWE is CWE-665 Improper Initialization. Siemens also indicates no fix is planned.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-8744 is related to improper initialization in Intel CSME, TXE, and SPS. It requires local access with high privileges (except Siemens, which notes low privileges) and could lead to escalation of privileges, information disclosure or DoS. NetApp Cloud Backup is affected but will not be fixed. Siemens controllers are also affected but no fix is planned.

**Note**: The CVSS scores and vectors are consistent across all NetApp documents and differ from the Siemens document, which has a higher base score and lower privilege requirements. This suggests different impact depending on the affected product.
