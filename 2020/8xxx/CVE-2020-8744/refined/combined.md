SUMMARY

Intel has published information on vulnerabilities in Intel products in November 2020. This advisory lists
the Siemens Controllers that are affected by these vulnerabilities.

In this advisory we take a representative CVE from each advisory:

• “Intel CSME, SPS, TXE, AMT and DAL Advisory” Intel-SA-00391 is represented by CVE-2020-8744

• “BIOS Advisory” Intel-SA-00358 is represented by CVE-2020-0591.

Siemens is currently working on BIOS updates that include chipset microcode updates and recommends
speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to run untrusted code on affected systems

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility
to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in
C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel
to the STEP 7 program if required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-0591

Improper buffer restrictions in BIOS ﬁrmware for some Intel(R) Processors may allow a privileged user
to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.
