If the `msg` provided to `OS_CleanMSG` has a `(` after the ID, but doesn't not contain a `->` or `:` it should be rejected with a `FORMAT_ERROR`.

Prev. to this commit nesting `strstr` for `->` as the first argument to `strchr` for `:` results in a null ptr deref when the message is malformed.

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814#issue-550426476)

The `ossec-analysisd`'s `OS_CleanMSG` function doesn't remove or encode terminal control characters or newlines from processed log messages. In many cases those control characters/newline are later logged.

There have been cases where allowing arbitrary control characters in log messages has led to command execution with specific terminal emulator implementations. As a result many pieces of software (e.g. [Apache HTTPD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-1862)) have added escaping of control characters in log messages. It may also be possible to abuse terminal control characters to hide previous messages in a log, tricking system administrators into missing events.

Similarly, because newlines (`\n`) are permitted in messages processed by `ossec-analysisd` it may be possible to inject nested events to the ossec log. This may result in system administrators being tricked into thinking alerts fired that did not.

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1821#issue-550427631)

Hi folks,

I spent some free time recently auditing OSSEC. I was primarily focused on a threat model where an OSSEC agent is compromised (e.g. the agent key and assoc. counters are known) and used to attack the OSSEC server (primarily `ossec-remoted` and `ossec-analysisd`). Given the problem domain of OSSEC and HIDS generally I think this is fair game. Since these are post-auth bugs and there isn't guidance on vulnerability disclosure in the README I thought it was acceptable to post information full-disclosure to the repo.

I found a handful of bugs and have done my best to address the root cause, the affected versions, the impact and potential fixes in the issues I've filed. I will request CVEs for the security relevant bugs later on.

In terms of rough risk levels I'd categorize the findings as follows:

Informational:

* os\_regex-empty-pcre2-off-by-one - [os\_regex: OSPcre2\_Compile off-by-one heap overflow compiling empty regex. #1811](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1811) (*Edit: now fixed by [os\_regex: refuse to compile empty PCRE2 pattern. #1826](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1826)*)
* rootcheck-check-rc-if-shell-injection-risk - [rootcheck: risk of shell metachar injection in check-rc-if. #1812](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1812)

Low:

* analysisd-syscheck-decoder-msg-location-path-injection ([CVE-2020-8446](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-96pq-2p2q-gx9m "CVE-2020-8446")) - [CVE-2020-8446: analysisd: syscheck decoder location path injection. #1813](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1813)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-allows-control-chars-in-msg ([CVE-2020-8445](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9vhf-xgg9-m6cf "CVE-2020-8445")) - [CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. #1814](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-bad-location-segfault ([CVE-2020-8448](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vg3-7pxv-7pq6 "CVE-2020-8448")) - [CVE-2020-8448: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG segfault processing invalid msg location. #1815](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1815) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix possible null ptr deref in OS\_CleanMSG. #1823](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1823)*)
* ~~analysisd-syscheck-decoder-off-by-one-read - [syscheck decoder: off-by-one heap overflow in DB operations. #1819](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1819)~~ (*Edit: I made a mistake in my analysis here, it's not a bug*).

Med:

* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-off-by-one-syslog ([CVE-2020-8443](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wpvm-52j3-27mh "CVE-2020-8443")) - [CVE-2020-8443: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG off-by-one heap overflow cleaning syslog msgs. #1816](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1816) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix off-by-one in OS\_CleanMSG. #1824](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1824)*)
* analysisd-OS\_ReadMSG-use-after-free-ossecalert ([CVE-2020-8444](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qjcm-4w5p-gw32 "CVE-2020-8444")) - [CVE-2020-8444: analysisd: OS\_ReadMSG heap use-after-free with ossec-alert msgs. #1817](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1817)
* analysisd-OS\_ReadMSG-use-after-free-syscheck ([CVE-2020-8447](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g47q-9m4h-vgjq "CVE-2020-8447")) - [CVE-2020-8447: analysisd: OS\_ReadMSG heap use-after-free decoding syscheck msgs. #1818](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1818)

High:

* analysisd-rootcheck-decoder-heap-overflow ([CVE-2020-8442](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-249h-cc9x-grm3 "CVE-2020-8442")) - [CVE-2020-8442: analysisd rootcheck decoder: heap overflow in DB\_File. #1820](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1820) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix heap overflow in rootkit decoder. #1825](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1825)*)

Some caveats/context to add:

1. I'm not a professional C coder, w.r.t suggested fixes YMMV!
2. I don't write exploits for a living. My assessments of exploitability/risk should be considered lower bounds.
3. This wasn't an extensive audit. I followed my nose and used some fuzzing.
4. OSSEC 2.7 seems to be the earliest tag in the Github repo. I didn't dig deeper into history to see if any of these bugs affect older releases (some likely do).

If you would be interested in trying to adopt fuzzing as part of your CI (or as an integration with oss-fuzz, etc) I'd be happy to try and provide some notes but likely don't have the resources to implement it myself to a merge-able standard of work.

Thanks! You can close this top-level issue as you see appropriate.

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1815#issue-550426613)

In `src/analysisd/cleanevent.c` the `ossec-analysisd`'s `OS_CleanMSG` function handles the location portion of a message differently when the first character after a 2 digit ID is `(`, indicating it came from a remote agent via `ossec-remoted`.

When remote agent locations are processed `OS_CleanMSG` tries to null terminate the received location substring of the overall log message to store in `lf->location` by advancing past the `->` in the string to the first `:` character:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/cleanevent.c#L45-L59)

Lines 45 to 59
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | /\* Is this from an agent? \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | if ( \*msg == '(' ) |
|  | { /\* look past '->' for the first ':' \*/ |
|  | pieces = strchr(strstr(msg, "->"), ':'); |
|  | if(!pieces) |
|  | { |
|  | merror(FORMAT\_ERROR, ARGV0); |
|  | return(-1); |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | \*pieces = '\0'; |
|  | pieces++; |
|  |  |
|  | os\_strdup(msg, lf->location); |

Unfortunately the nesting of `strstr` as the first argument to `strchr` on L48 doesn't account for the possibility of a location string that starts with `(` but doesn't contain a `->`.

E.g. processing the msg `00:(:` will result in the `strstr` returning NULL, meaning the `strchr` call will be `strchr(NULL, ":")` and a segfault will occur.

This code was introduced in [95cd0c9](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/95cd0c9bae450e101222f9fae5127e7034a252ca) on Nov 13, 2013. I believe it affects [OSSEC 2.7+](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/releases/tag/v2.7).

It seems that in all cases `ossec-remoted` will always write a well-formed location into the message it writes to the `ossec` UNIX domain socket queue because it uses `SendMSG` and populates the `locmsg` unconditionally:

[ossec-hids/src/remoted/secure.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/remoted/secure.c#L187-L190)

Lines 187 to 190
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | /\* Generate srcmsg \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | snprintf(srcmsg, OS\_FLSIZE, "(%s) %s", |
|  | keys.keyentries[agentid]->name, |
|  | keys.keyentries[agentid]->ip->ip); |

[ossec-hids/src/shared/mq\_op.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/shared/mq_op.c#L85)

Line 85
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | snprintf(tmpstr, OS\_MAXSTR, "%c:%s->%s", loc, locmsg, message); |
| --- | --- |

I believe that means the only way this is triggerable is with direct write access to the socket, and probably makes the exploitability very low.

One possible fix (edit: implemented in [#1823](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1823)) is to separate the `strstr` and return an error when it returns `NULL` before performing the subsequent `strchr` with the result pointer.
