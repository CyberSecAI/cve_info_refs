Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-8760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Intel AMT (Active Management Technology), which is incorporated into certain NetApp products. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not described in this document, but it is referred to the vendor advisory INTEL-SA-00391.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The document indicates that the vulnerability in Intel AMT can lead to escalation of privileges, information disclosure, or Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability is present in the Intel AMT component used in the listed NetApp products.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could result in:
*   Disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Addition or modification of data.
*   Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
The CVSS vector for CVE-2020-8760 is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L`. This means:
    *   **AV:L (Local):** The attacker needs local access to the system.
    *   **AC:H (High):**  Exploitation requires specific conditions that are hard to achieve.
    *  **PR:H (High):** The attacker needs high privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability
    *   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is required.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality
    *   **I:H (High):** There is a high impact on integrity
    *   **A:L (Low):** There is a low impact on availability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would require:
*   Local access to the vulnerable system.
*   High privileges on the target system.
*    The attacker must achieve the specific conditions required for the vulnerability to be exploitable, as indicated by the high attack complexity.

**Affected Products:**
*   NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) is the only NetApp product listed as affected by this vulnerability.
*   The document explicitly lists many products that are NOT affected

**Additional Notes:**
*   NetApp has marked NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) as "Won't Fix," meaning there are no plans to address this vulnerability.
* The document refers to the Intel advisory INTEL-SA-00391 for more details on the vulnerability.
