Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Active Resource, a REST modeling framework in Ruby on Rails, processes specially crafted requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is an information disclosure vulnerability.
- Active Resource prior to version 5.1.1 does not properly handle crafted requests, leading to the potential exposure of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to data.
- The severity is considered medium.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted requests to the Active Resource component.
- This involves manipulating the request format or parameters to access data in an unintended way.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable application that uses the Active Resource framework.
- The attacker would need some knowledge of the Active Resource implementation or its interface to craft the malicious requests effectively.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

- The vulnerability affects `rubygem-activeresource` versions prior to 5.1.1.
- The fix involves upgrading `rubygem-activeresource` to version 5.1.1.
- The vulnerability is described as allowing specially crafted requests to access data in an unexpected way which might leak sensitive information.
- The issue was addressed in Fedora 33 through an update to version 5.1.1.
