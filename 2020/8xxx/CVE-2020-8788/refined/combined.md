Hello,

I found two vulnerabilities that affect to ClearCanvas ImageServer 3.0 Alpha:

* Cross-site Scripting (XSS) reflected
* HTML Injection

You can reproduce both with the following details,

1. Payload: <p/onclick=alert(1)>xss
2. Vulnerable POST data: &UserName=<p/onclick=alert(1)>xss
3. Output: A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client (UserName="<p/onclick=alert(1)>...").
4. Step 1: Open /ImageServer/Pages/Login/Default.aspx or /Pages/Login/Default.aspx URL login page according your config deployments
5. Step 2: Fill the username and password inputs with XSS/HTML payload and submit the login form.
6. Step 3: Then, you will have a XSS/HTML injections clicking on payload.
