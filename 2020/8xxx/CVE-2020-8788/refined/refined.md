The provided content describes a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection vulnerability in ClearCanvas ImageServer 3.0 Alpha.

**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the response. Specifically, the `UserName` parameter in the login form is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the user-supplied input containing JavaScript code back to the user's browser without proper sanitization.
*   **HTML Injection:** Similar to XSS, the application reflects user-supplied HTML tags back to the user's browser without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code or HTML into the login page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
*   This could lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code or HTML tags.
*   The attacker includes the crafted payload as part of the `UserName` field in the login form (POST data).
*   The vulnerable application reflects this input back in the response when the user attempts to log in.
*   The victim's browser then executes the malicious JavaScript/renders the malicious HTML

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the `/ImageServer/Pages/Login/Default.aspx` or `/Pages/Login/Default.aspx` endpoint.
