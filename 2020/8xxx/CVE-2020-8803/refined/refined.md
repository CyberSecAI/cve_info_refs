Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8803

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) issue.
*   The `add_to_prospect_list` function in SuiteCRM does not properly validate user input passed through the `parent_module` and `parent_type` parameters.
*   This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the path of files included using the `include()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files from the webroot due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Broken Access Control:** By including arbitrary files, attackers can potentially bypass authorization mechanisms and access administrative functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including attacker-controlled PHP files, remote code execution may be possible.
*   **Bypass of Authorization Mechanisms:** Attackers can potentially execute administrative functions without proper authentication by including files that do not implement ACL checks (e.g. by setting "parent_module" parameter to "Administration" and the "parent_type" parameter to "expandDatabase").
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Depending on the included file, sensitive data may be accessed or modified.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `add_to_prospect_list` function.
*   **Malicious Input:**  The attacker provides malicious values to the `parent_module` and `parent_type` parameters, specifying a file to include within the webroot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SuiteCRM instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the `add_to_prospect_list` function and the structure of the SuiteCRM webroot to craft the malicious file paths effectively.
*  **No Authentication Required** Based on the description of the vulnerability, it does not state authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects SuiteCRM versions 7.11.11 and prior.
*   No official solution was available at the time of the advisory.
*   The vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond before the public disclosure.
