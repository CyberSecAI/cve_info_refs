Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8086:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `mod_auth_ldap` and `mod_auth_ldap2` modules in Prosody handle XMPP addresses when determining admin access. Specifically, they only check the "user" part of the JID (Jabber Identifier) and ignore the domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete JID Validation:** The modules do not properly validate the full JID when checking for admin privileges. They only consider the username part, which can lead to authorization bypass.
*   **Incorrect Admin Granting:** Because the modules only check usernames, a user on a remote server with the same username as a local admin could be incorrectly granted admin access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote user with a matching username to a local admin can gain full administrative access to the Prosody server.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** With admin access, an attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete any data handled by the server, including user information and message data.
*   **Server Control:** The attacker can take complete control of the server, potentially disrupting services for all users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by connecting to the XMPP server with a JID crafted to have the same username as an existing administrator.
*   **Remote User:** The attack is performed by a remote user, meaning that the attacker does not need local access to the server in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XMPP Client:** The attacker needs an XMPP client to connect to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Local Admin Username:** The attacker needs to know a username that corresponds to an admin user on the target Prosody server.
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to connect to the server over the network.
