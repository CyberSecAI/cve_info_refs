Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8809:

**Root Cause:** The Gurux GXDLMS Director software uses an unencrypted HTTP connection to download updates for add-in DLLs and OBIS code files. Additionally, the software does not perform integrity checks on downloaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check:** The software downloads code (add-in DLLs and OBIS code files) without verifying its integrity, leading to potential tampering.
*   **Insecure Communication Channel:** The use of unencrypted HTTP for update downloads allows man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A MitM attacker can modify the update files, injecting malicious code.
    *   For add-in DLLs, this results in direct code execution.
    *   For OBIS code files, this can lead to code execution by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2020-8810) and placing malicious executables in autorun directories or DLLs within the program's installation directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the user and the update server can intercept and modify the update files. This includes controlling the content of `gurux.fi/obis/files.xml` and `gurux.fi/updates/updates.xml` which are used to direct the program to download updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the user or be able to intercept network traffic (e.g., through a compromised Wi-Fi network).
*   **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP traffic between the Gurux GXDLMS Director software and the update server (gurux.fi).

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content also describes a related vulnerability, CVE-2020-8810 (CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal), which is used in conjunction with CVE-2020-8809 to achieve code execution via modified OBIS code files.
* The content provides a detailed reproduction scenario, including modifying the `hosts` file and crafting malicious `files.xml` content for the attacker's HTTP server.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Gurux GXDLMS Director prior to 8.5.1905.1301.
