The provided content relates to CVE-2020-8567.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of file paths specified within the `SecretProviderClass` configuration. Specifically, the `objectName`, `objectAlias`, or `fileName` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal using `..`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability in the secrets-store-csi-driver plugin.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation of `objectName`, `objectAlias`, and `fileName` parameters within `SecretProviderClass`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can write to arbitrary file paths on the host filesystem, including `/var/lib/kubelet/pods`.
- This can lead to container escapes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution, as the attacker could potentially overwrite critical system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user with the ability to create/modify `SecretProviderClass` objects.
- The attacker crafts a `SecretProviderClass` object with malicious `objectName`, `objectAlias`, or `fileName` parameters containing directory traversal sequences (`..`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create or modify `SecretProviderClass` objects within the Kubernetes cluster.
- The attacker needs to have a privileged position or be an authorized user who can interact with the Kubernetes API.
