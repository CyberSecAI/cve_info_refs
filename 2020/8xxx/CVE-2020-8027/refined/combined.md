| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c0)  Thorsten Kukuk   2020-08-20 17:03:29 UTC  ``` openldap_update_modules_path.sh from openldap2 has some critical problems:  1. it starts the slapd daemon on update unconditionally, even if it was not running before and is not enabled. This can have really bad side effects, especially during an offline upgrade with YaST2.  2. It uses fixed directories and files in /tmp without any checks if they already exists. So the script would overwrite anything on the system if a user creates this directories or files. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-08-24 08:52:12 UTC  ``` This is a SUSE specific script that is part of the openldap2 package. It is run once from a `%post` scriptlet in the package's spec file if a statefile in /var/adm/openldap_modules_path_updated doesn't exist.  The script is found in Factory, the currently maintained openSUSE codestreams and in the SUSE:SLE-15:Update codestream.  It looks pretty bad. It uses two fixed paths:  ``` tmp_file='/tmp/ldap_conf_tmp.ldif' backup='/tmp/slapd.d' ```  It doesn't call `set -o errexit`, thus failures to create e.g. `mkdir $backup` aren't recognized.  Attack vectors are as follows:  1) /usr/sbin/slapcat -n0 -F ${conf_dir} -l ${tmp_file} -o ldif-wrap=no  This writes to $tmp_file, following symlinks. It is a DoS vector, content is not directly under user control.  2) mkdir ${backup}    cp -r ${conf_dir}/* ${backup}/  This will also follow symlinks, therefore whichever files are present in ${conf_dir} can be copied over to an arbitrary path, possibly overwriting existing files of the same name.  Also the content of the configuration files will become accessible to an attacker, which is not normally the case, because:  root# ls -lhd /etc/openldap/slapd.d/ drwxrwx--- 2 ldap ldap 4.0K 19. Aug 19:18 /etc/openldap/slapd.d/  3) /usr/sbin/slapadd -n0 -F ${conf_dir} -l ${tmp_file}  This will replace the existing slapd configuration by the possibly attacker controlled file $tmp_file, therefore the slapd can be completely compromised.  4) /usr/bin/systemctl stop slapd.service    /usr/bin/systemctl start slapd.service  This unconditional starting/stopping could prove problematic. The service should only be started again if it was running in the first place. Also it would be better not to stop a running service but find a runtime reconfiguration method, if possible.  These findings should be treated under EMBARGO until updates are available. We will need to assign one or more CVEs. I'm not sure if one CVE suffices for "bad tmp file handling" or whether we should assign CVEs for issues 1) - 3 )individually.  Issues 1) - 3) can be fixed by using `mktemp` instead of using the fixed paths. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c20)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-09-22 15:09:31 UTC  ``` SLE15 is now released ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c21)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-22 19:24:15 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:2712-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

Did you consider the backward compatibility and that it doesn't introduce any regressions for existing customers?  In Factory the fix is still missing. The embargo is lifted, however. Can you please also fix Factory now? And then please check whether the child bugs [1175683](show_bug.cgi?id=1175683 "RESOLVED FIXED"), [1175684](show_bug.cgi?id=1175684 "RESOLVED FIXED") and 1175685 can be closed. Since you replaced the original script then they probably won't be applicable any more. ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c27)  William Brown   2020-10-27 00:40:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #26](show_bug.cgi?id=1175568#c26)) > William, I'm seeing that in SLE-15-SP[12] you've replaced the original > script by a new couple of scripts.

I also did test the upgrade scenario and what it does. The script itself is only relevant for a subset of configs, and only for SLE12 to SLE15 upgrades.  >  > In Factory the fix is still missing.
