Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-8858:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a **command injection** flaw. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly validated before being used to construct and execute a system command. Specifically, the `DestIP` parameter within the `MainPing.asp` page of the web server is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient validation or sanitization of the `DestIP` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system call.
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** This is the specific type of vulnerability, where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system by injecting them into an improperly handled input field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.
- **Root-Level Access:** The vulnerability enables the attacker to execute code in the context of root, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the MGate 5105-MB-EIP device, specifically targeting the `MainPing.asp` page and the `DestIP` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- **Authentication:**  The attacker needs valid authentication credentials to access the web interface. This is a privileged or authenticated attack vector as stated in the ZDI advisory.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know the specific parameter (`DestIP` within `MainPing.asp`) that is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Moxa MGate 5105-MB-EIP Series Protocol Gateways with firmware version 4.1 or lower.
- Moxa has released a firmware update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Dove Chiu, Philippe Lin, Charles Perine, Marco Balduzzi, Ryan Flores, and Rainer Vosseler from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).

In summary, CVE-2020-8858 is a critical vulnerability due to the ease of remote exploitation and the potential for complete system compromise through arbitrary command execution at root level. The lack of input validation in the web interface is the root cause.
