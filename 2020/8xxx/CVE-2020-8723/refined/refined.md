Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Intel Server Boards, Systems and Compute Modules firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The specific weakness is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which suggests that the system is not properly sanitizing or encoding user-supplied input before displaying it within a web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or a denial of service (DoS). The specific impact is described as low confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent network access. This means the attacker must be on the same network segment as the affected device.
- The attacker also requires user interaction, meaning they need to trick a user into performing some action for the XSS payload to execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device (adjacent access).
- The attacker does not need any authentication to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker also needs the user to perform an action (user interaction), thus it's not fully automated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NetApp advisory indicates that the affected NetApp products are NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage. However, these products have been moved to "Won't Fix" status.
- The Intel advisory indicates that the vulnerable versions of the Intel Server Boards, Systems, and Compute Modules firmware are those before version 1.59
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 5.4.
