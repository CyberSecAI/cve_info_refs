- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The server parses XML input from the agent periodically, and if the XML input contains references to external entities, it can lead to an XXE vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the agent servlet.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploiting the XXE vulnerability could lead to unintended operations and may crash the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious XML input from the agent containing references to external entities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML input to the server, which is normally done through an agent.
