```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was missing a check to ensure that the wait queue created by `enc_untrusted_create_wait_queue` is in untrusted memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The lack of validation on the memory location of the wait queue could lead to the use of enclave memory for the wait queue, which can cause issues.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is not directly related to a security vulnerability, but a potential denial of service or unexpected behavior due to an incorrect memory location being used.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the creation of a wait queue by the `enc_untrusted_create_wait_queue` function. An attacker would need to influence how this function allocates memory.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need the ability to cause the `enc_untrusted_create_wait_queue` function to create a wait queue in enclave memory instead of untrusted memory."
