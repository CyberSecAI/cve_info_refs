Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8804

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are present across different modules and interfaces within SuiteCRM.
    *   **SOAP API (`set_entries()`):** Input passed through the `name_value_lists` parameter (specifically `first_name` and `last_name`) is not sanitized before being used in the `check_for_duplicate_contacts()` function.
    *   **EmailUIAjax Interface (`addContact`):** Input passed through the `bean_module` and `bean_id` parameters isn't sanitized.
    *  **EmailUIAjax Interface (`addContactsMultiple`):** Input passed through the `contactData` parameter is not sanitized.
    *   **EmailUIAjax Interface (`removeContact`):** Input passed through the `ids` parameter is not sanitized.
    *   **MailMerge Module (`search`):** Input passed through the `rel_module` parameter is not sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive data from the database. This could include customer information, user credentials, and other confidential business data.
*   **Boolean-based SQL injection:** Used in EmailUIAjax interface for the `addContact` and `addContactsMultiple` actions
*   **Time-based SQL injection**: Used in the EmailUIAjax interface for the `removeContact` action and in the MailMerge module for the `search` action.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities are accessible through the SOAP API, EmailUIAjax interface, and the MailMerge module of SuiteCRM.
*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into various parameters through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send requests to the vulnerable SuiteCRM instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate parameters in the API, UI, or module components mentioned in the report. This could be an authenticated user, depending on the specific attack vector.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Egidio Romano.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond until public disclosure.
*   The vendor released version 7.11.11 to patch these vulnerabilities.
