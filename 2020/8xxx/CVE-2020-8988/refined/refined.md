### CVE-2020-8988 Analysis:

**1. Relevance to CVE:**

   - This document provides a detailed security analysis of the Voatz mobile voting application, which has been used in U.S. elections. Although the provided CVE description is a placeholder, the content is highly relevant to potential vulnerabilities in voting systems.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The analysis identifies multiple vulnerabilities stemming from weak cryptographic practices, reliance on third-party services, and insufficient security mechanisms in the Voatz application and server infrastructure. The lack of transparency and public scrutiny on the platform contributed to these weaknesses.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**
      - An attacker with root access to a user's device can bypass security measures (e.g., Zimperium malware detection), steal the user's PIN and authentication data, modify the user interface to alter votes, and exfiltrate sensitive information. The PIN, used for authentication and database decryption, is vulnerable to brute force attacks.
   - **Server-Side Vulnerabilities:**
      - The server can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack between the user's device and the backend, due to a lack of proper authentication and signing of data. The server can alter or observe user votes, even with optimistic blockchain use.
   - **Network Vulnerabilities:**
      - A passive network adversary can infer the user's vote through side-channel attacks by observing the length of encrypted packets. The plaintext size, revealing voting choices, is not padded. The additional encryption layer, in fact, exacerbates this issue.
   - **Privacy Issues:**
      - The application sends significant personal information to third-party services like Jumio for ID verification. Voatz also collects detailed data like IP addresses and GPS information, raising privacy concerns.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Compromised Election Integrity:**
       -  Adversaries can alter votes, steal user credentials, manipulate user interfaces, and disrupt the election process, thereby influencing the final results.
   - **Privacy Violations:**
      -  Voter data (including PII) can be accessed, exfiltrated, and used maliciously. Information sent to Voatz and its third party services includes email, physical address, birth date, IP address, photos, device details, and preferred language. This also has national security implications if used by overseas military voters.
   - **Denial of Service:**
      - Network adversaries can block voting packets, leading to denial of service and preventing voters from casting their ballots.
   - **Coercion:**
      - The lack of PIN requirement after initial login and the capability to modify votes without detection create an opportunity for coercion.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Malware:**
      - Root access on a user's device via malware, or similar exploits.
   - **Network Attacks:**
      - Passive and active MITM attacks, data interception via insecure networks.
   - **Compromised Server:**
       - Exploitation of vulnerabilities within Voatz's API server, or other elements of the backend.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Client-Side Attacks:**
      - Requires root access to the user's Android device.
   - **Server-Side Attacks:**
      - Requires control over the Voatz API server (or ability to perform a MITM attack on connections to that server)
   - **Network Attacks:**
      - Ability to passively observe and/or actively intercept network traffic between the user's device and the server.
   - **General Attacks:**
       - Ability to create malware and/or social engineering skills to trick users into installing the software.

**Additional Notes:**

* The paper highlights the risks associated with internet voting, particularly mobile voting solutions like Voatz.
* The lack of transparency by Voatz regarding its security model makes it difficult to ascertain the extent of vulnerabilities and leaves it vulnerable to undiscovered flaws.
* The analysis demonstrates that the application's claims of end-to-end encryption, anonymity, and use of blockchain technology are not sufficient to protect against various attacks and do not always meet claims made by the vendor.
* The paper questions the effectiveness of bug bounty programs in improving the security of such systems, especially when they exclude crucial attack vectors (MITM, physical access).
* The research team took a black-box approach to analysis, creating a clean-room reimplementation of Voatz's server based on their reverse engineering of the android client. This approach is highlighted as sufficient to find critical issues despite lacking access to the backend, but the paper notes that a well-resourced adversary could potentially find more flaws without having to observe these legal and ethical guidelines.
