Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient sanitization of pasted text within OX Documents. Specifically, script code embedded within text copied from a native source and pasted into an OX Documents file is executed. This vulnerability arose due to a recent library update that introduced the flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) (CWE-80): The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically text being pasted from an external source, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking: Attackers can steal user session cookies and impersonate them.
  - Triggering unwanted actions via the web interface: This includes actions such as sending mail, deleting data, or performing other operations on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Pasting malicious content: An attacker crafts a text document containing hidden JavaScript code.
 - Social Engineering: The attacker tricks a user into copying text from the malicious document (e.g., a text file) and pasting it into an OX Documents file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a text document with embedded JavaScript.
- The attacker needs to be able to social engineer a victim into copying this text into OX Documents.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, but does require a user with an active session to perform the action of pasting in the malicious text.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to a library update.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 7.8.4-rev63, 7.10.1-rev31, 7.10.2-rev26, 7.10.3-rev10 of OX App Suite.
- The provided CVSS score is 2.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
