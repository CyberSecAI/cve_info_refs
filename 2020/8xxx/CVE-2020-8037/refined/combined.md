Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2444-1              debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Utkarsh Gupta

Package        : tcpdump
Version        : 4.9.3-1~deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-8037
Debian Bug     : 973877

The ppp de-capsulator in tcpdump 4.9.3 can be convinced to allocate
a large amount of memory.

The buffer should be big enough to hold the captured data, but it
doesn‚Äôt need to be big enough to hold the entire on-the-network
packet, if we haven‚Äôt captured all of it.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
4.9.3-1~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.

For the detailed security status of tcpdump please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tcpdump>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

PPP: When un-escaping, don't allocate a too-large buffer.

```
The buffer should be big enough to hold the captured data, but it
doesn't need to be big enough to hold the entire on-the-network packet,
if we haven't captured all of it.
