Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8552:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Kubernetes API server was found to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the use of an unbounded 'client' label in the `apiserver_request_total` metric. This label reflects the client's user agent, and each new value added a sustained memory overhead as the metric is tracked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded metric label: The `apiserver_request_total` metric used a label based on the client's user agent, without any limits.
- Memory exhaustion: Each new unique client user-agent added to the metric caused increased memory consumption.
- Lack of input validation: The API server did not validate or sanitize the user-agent string, allowing an attacker to provide arbitrary values.
- Unauthenticated access: Prior to v1.14, unauthenticated requests were possible by default, allowing for an easy attack vector.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could send repeated, crafted HTTP requests with unique user-agent strings, eventually exhausting the available memory on the API server and causing it to crash (OOM).
- Resource exhaustion: Successful exploitation leads to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the Kubernetes API server.
- API Requests: The attacker must make authorized API requests.
- Crafted user-agent: The attacker crafts HTTP requests with unique user-agent strings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Kubernetes API server.
- Ability to make authorized resource requests to the Kubernetes API server (prior to v1.14, this was possible via unauthenticated requests by default)
- Ability to send HTTP requests with arbitrary user-agent strings.

**Additional details:**

- This vulnerability was publicly discussed and was assigned a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).
- The vulnerability affects Kubernetes versions v1.15.0 prior to v1.15.10, v1.16.0 prior to v1.16.7, and v1.17.0 prior to v1.17.3.
- Patches were released in versions v1.15.10, v1.16.7, and v1.17.3.
- Mitigations include preventing unauthenticated or unauthorized access to the API and having the API server auto-restart if it goes OOM.
- The vulnerability was reported by Gus Lees (Amazon)

The provided documents also mention the vulnerability in the context of NetApp and Red Hat products that incorporate Kubernetes. The Red Hat bugzilla entries provide tracking information for the vulnerability and errata links for various OpenShift versions. The Fedora mailing list mentions the CVE as part of security fixes in the `origin` package update.
