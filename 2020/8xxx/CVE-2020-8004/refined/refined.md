Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2020-8004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an insufficient access restriction in the flash read-out protection (RDP) of the STM32F1 series microcontrollers.
- While the RDP blocks data accesses via the debug interface's data bus (DCode bus), it does not block memory accesses via the instruction bus (ICode bus).
- Exception handling, specifically the vector fetch process, reads exception entry addresses from flash memory using the ICode bus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Protection:** The RDP mechanism only protects against data bus (DCode) accesses, leaving the instruction bus (ICode) vulnerable.
- **Exception Vector Fetch Exposure:**  The CPU fetches exception vectors from flash memory using the ICode bus, exposing memory content through the program counter (PC).
- **Vector Table Relocation:** The Vector Table Offset Register (VTOR) can be used to relocate the vector table to different locations in flash memory. Combining this with exception triggering provides access to arbitrary memory locations.
- **Wrap-around Behavior:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the wrap-around behavior of unaligned vector tables when an exception number exceeds the table size, allowing access to previously inaccessible memory regions.
- **Lack of Debug Interface Disabling:** Unlike some other STM32 series, the debug interface cannot be completely disabled, leaving it open to attack when RDP is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Firmware Extraction:** An attacker can extract significant portions of the microcontroller's flash memory, including potentially sensitive data like intellectual property and cryptographic keys.
- **Bypass Read-Out Protection:** The vulnerability completely bypasses the read-out protection mechanism of the STM32F1 series.
- **Cloning and Reverse Engineering:** The extracted firmware can be used for device cloning, reverse engineering, and modification.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the microcontroller's debug interface (SWD).
- **Debug Probe:**  A debug probe (e.g., SEGGER J-Link) is required to connect to the debug interface.
- **Software Tools:**  OpenOCD is used for interacting with the debug probe and controlling the target microcontroller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the device to connect a debug probe.
- **Debugging Knowledge:** The attacker needs an understanding of microcontroller debugging, exception handling, and the ARMv7-M architecture.
- **Software Tools Proficiency:**  The attacker needs to be able to use OpenOCD and interact with a debug probe.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The attack involves deliberately generating exceptions (NMI, PendSV, SysTick, DebugMonitor, BusFault, MemManage, UsageFault, HardFault, SVCall, and external interrupts) to trigger the vector fetch.
- The program counter (PC) value, when an exception is triggered, contains the address of the exception handler fetched from the flash memory, revealing the flash content.
- The least-significant bit (LSB) of the exception entry address is used to set the Thumb state and is not directly loaded into the PC. The correct address is retrieved by using the PC and Thumb state information.
- The attack is non-invasive, meaning it doesn't require hardware modifications to the target device.
- The amount of extractable memory and the speed of extraction depend on the number of external interrupts available on the specific device.
- The vulnerability was disclosed to STMicroelectronics, and source code was made available to facilitate discussion and further research.
