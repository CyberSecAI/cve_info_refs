{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The chkstat utility incorrectly followed symbolic links when setting permissions, leading to unintended setuid bits or capabilities being applied to the targets of these symlinks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of symbolic links",
      "Use of setuid bits/capabilities on unintended files"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation due to unintended capabilities/setuid bits, allowing an attacker to potentially execute commands with higher privileges than intended.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Exploitation of symlink following by the chkstat utility."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local access to the affected system, ability to modify or create symlinks.",
    "more_info": "The issue stems from chkstat following symlinks when setting permissions and capabilities, which was introduced after a fix for CVE-2019-3690. This resulted in `chkstat` setting capabilities or setuid bits on the targets of symlinks instead of the symlinks themselves. The vulnerability affected `/usr/bin/cdrecord`, `/usr/bin/rsh`, `/usr/bin/rlogin`, and `/usr/bin/rcp`, redirecting to `/usr/bin/wodim` and `usr/bin/m{rsh,rlogin,rcp}` respectively."
