{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir` method in Guava creates temporary directories with insecure default permissions that can allow co-resident users to access/modify files within the directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default permissions on temporary directory creation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially steal secrets stored within the temporary directories or modify files within the directory due to the insecure permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attack via a malicious co-resident program"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker running a malicious program co-resident on the same machine is required to exploit this vulnerability."

  "content": "CVE-2020-8908\nThe file permissions on the file created by `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir` allows an attacker running a malicious program co-resident on the same machine can steal secrets stored in this directory. This is because by default on unix-like operating systems the `/temp` directory is shared between all users, so if the correct file permissions aren't set by the directory/file creator, the file becomes readable by all other users on that system.\n\nThe vulnerability can be fixed by explicitly setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system property to a \"safe\" directory when starting the JVM.\n\n The team decided to document the behavior, as well as deprecate the method as other alternatives exist."
