The provided content relates to **CVE-2020-8782**. Although the CVE description is a placeholder, the content gives specific details on the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The technical bulletin (SWI-PSA-2020-005) describes an issue concerning a local privilege escalation and a LAN-Side RPC server remote code execution within ALEOS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: It's possible for an attacker with local access to gain elevated privileges on the device
- LAN-Side RPC Server Remote Code Execution: It's possible for an attacker on the LAN to execute arbitrary code on the device by using the RPC server

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: An attacker gaining root privileges on the device will have full control over the system, allowing them to potentially extract sensitive information, modify settings, install malware, or disrupt services.
- LAN-Side RPC Server Remote Code Execution: An attacker remotely executing code can completely compromise the device with no user intervention needed beyond initial network access, enabling them to perform malicious actions, such as participating in botnets, stealing data, or disrupting network operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: Requires local access to the device.
- LAN-Side RPC Server Remote Code Execution: Requires access to the local network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local Privilege Escalation: The attacker needs to have some form of local access or shell access to the device
- LAN-Side RPC Server Remote Code Execution: The attacker must be on the same LAN as the device.
