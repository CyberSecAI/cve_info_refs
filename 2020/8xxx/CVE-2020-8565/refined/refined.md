{
  "CVE-2020-8565": {
    "Description": "In Kubernetes, if the logging level is to at least 9, authorization and bearer tokens will be written to log files. This can occur both in API server logs and client tool output like `kubectl`.",
    "Root cause": "An incomplete fix for CVE-2019-11250 allowed for token leak in logs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sanitization of log output at high verbosity levels leading to secret exposure."
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of authorization and bearer tokens in log files.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "By exploiting configurations with a high log level, an attacker with access to logs could obtain valid authorization and bearer tokens."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs access to Kubernetes logs, and the logging level must be at least 9"
  }
