Affected CVE

Issued: February 5th, 2020

Last Updated: September 1st, 2021

CA Technologies, A Broadcom Company, is alerting customers to three vulnerabilities in CA Unified Infrastructure Management (Nimsoft / UIM). Multiple vulnerabilities exist that can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands, read from or write to systems, or conduct denial of service attacks. CA published solutions to address these vulnerabilities and recommends that all affected customers implement these solutions.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2020-8010, occurs due to improper ACL handling. A remote attacker can execute commands, read from, or write to the target system.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2020-8011, occurs due to a null pointer dereference. A remote attacker can crash the Controller service.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2020-8012, occurs due to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Controller service. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Risk Rating**

High (cumulative)

**Platform(s)**

All supported robot platforms (i.e. Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX and HPUX)

**Affected Products**

UIM product versions 20.1, 20.3.x, and 9.20 and below are affected. The applicable component is robot (also known as controller).

The robot versions below 7.97HF8, 9.20HF9, 9.20SHF9, 9.33HF5, and 9.33SHF5 are affected.

**How to determine if the installation is affected**

Check for the controller version in IM or AC.  If the version is lower than 7.97HF8 for UIM 9.0.2, and 9.20HF9 or 9.20SHF9 for UIM 9.2.0, then it is affected.  If the version is lower than 9.33HF5 or 9.33SHF5 for UIM 20.1.x and UIM 20.3.x, then it is affected.

**Solution**

CA Technologies published the following solutions to address the vulnerabilities:

robot\_update patches 7.97HF8 (or above), 9.20HF9 (or above), 9.20SHF9 (or above), 9.33HF5 (or above), and 9.33SHF5 (or above)

*Note: UIM 8.5.1 users must upgrade robot to 7.97HF8 (or above).*
