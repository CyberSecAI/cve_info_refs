Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Improper access control in a subsystem of the Intel速 Computing Improvement Program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control mechanisms within the Intel速 Computing Improvement Program. This allows an authenticated user to potentially gain escalated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an authenticated user to achieve an escalation of privilege. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data, or potentially complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access is required for this vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where the Intel速 Computing Improvement Program is installed. The attacker also needs some user interaction (UI:R) to exploit this vulnerability. A high level of attack complexity (AC:H) is involved.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the Intel速 Computing Improvement Program before 2.4.5718.
- The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity with a CVSS base score of 6.7. The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- Intel recommends updating to version 2.4.5718 or later to mitigate the issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eran Shimony of CyberArk.
