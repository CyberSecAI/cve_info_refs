{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper security measures and reliance on third-party services.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Side-channel attack through network packet length revealing vote choices.",
    "Vulnerability to root access on voter's device, allowing for manipulation of votes and access to private information.",
    "Vulnerabilities due to lack of proper input validation and lack of protection against PIN brute-force attacks.",
    "Reliance on third party services with weak privacy guarantees, and vulnerabilities to attacks if those services are compromised.",
   "Lack of effective authentication on the API server that can't be subverted."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": [
    "Exposure of user's vote and personal information.",
    "Alteration of votes by malicious actors with root access or a compromised API server.",
    "Interference with vote submission.",
    "Privacy violation due to extensive use of 3rd party libraries, and the exposure of PII to the service." ,
  "Potential for coercion through the app's lack of PIN re-entry requirements."
  ],
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Passive network sniffing to infer votes.",
    "Compromise of a voter's device with root access.",
    "Exploitation of Voatz's API server.",
   "Exploiting the sidechannel to selectively drop packets."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to monitor network traffic.",
    "Root access to the voter's device.",
    "Access to or control over Voatz's API server." ,
    "The ability to intercept network traffic between the server and the user"
