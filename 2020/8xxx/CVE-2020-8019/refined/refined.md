{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `syslog-ng` package's post-installation script created log files in `/var/log/news` owned by the `news` user, but the script itself ran as root. This allowed a local user with `news` privileges to manipulate the log files or create symlinks within the directory, and then, when the `syslog-ng` package is reinstalled or upgraded, the root process would operate inside that user-controlled directory, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local privilege escalation",
    "TOCTOU vulnerability during file creation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user with `news` privileges could escalate their privileges to root by manipulating files within the `/var/log/news` directory and then triggering a reinstallation or upgrade of the `syslog-ng` package.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local user with `news` privileges needs to create a symlink to a sensitive file like /etc/shadow in the /var/log/news directory. Then, trigger a reinstallation or upgrade of the syslog-ng package. The %post script run by rpm will then change the permissions of the linked /etc/shadow file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to create files and symlinks in `/var/log/news` with the `news` user."
