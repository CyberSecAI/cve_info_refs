Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions on the `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf` file in SUSE's tomcat packages. This file was shipped with group-write permissions for the `tomcat` group (mode 664).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the group-writable permission on the `tomcat.conf` file. This allows any user belonging to the `tomcat` group to modify the file.
*   **Systemd-tmpfiles Configuration:** The `tomcat.conf` file is used by `systemd-tmpfiles` to manage temporary files and directories. By manipulating this file, an attacker can achieve privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Privilege Escalation:** A compromised `tomcat` group account can modify `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf` to create a setuid root binary, or modify other system files, leading to full local root access.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could insert commands into the file which will be executed during system boot or during the next invocation of systemd-tmpfiles, gaining code execution as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system, specifically the ability to execute commands as a user in the `tomcat` group.
*   **File Modification:** The attack involves modifying the `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised tomcat Group Account:** The attacker must have compromised an account belonging to the `tomcat` group.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute commands on the target system as the compromised `tomcat` user.

**Technical Details**
The provided example of the exploit scenario is as follows:
1.  The attacker gains access to a tomcat group account
2.  The attacker modifies `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf` to include an entry that changes the permissions of `/usr/bin/cat` to setuid root. 
3.  After a reboot or an invocation of `systemd-tmpfiles`, the `/usr/bin/cat` binary now has setuid root permissions.
4.  The attacker can now execute `/usr/bin/cat` to gain root access and access sensitive information such as `/etc/shadow`.

**Mitigation**
The vulnerability is mitigated by changing the permissions of the `/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf` file to be owned by root:root with mode 0644, which prevents modification by the tomcat group. Initially the fix was planned to be mode 0640, however this was later changed to match the permissions of other files in the directory.
