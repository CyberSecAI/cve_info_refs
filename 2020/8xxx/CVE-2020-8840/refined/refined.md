{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper deserialization of data in the jackson-databind library. Specifically, it fails to adequately validate the data during deserialization, allowing a malicious client to inject malicious code through specific classes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of untrusted data",
      "Lack of proper validation during deserialization",
      "Use of vulnerable 'gadget' classes"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. Other potential impacts include disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted JSON payloads via network requests to a service using the vulnerable jackson-databind library."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send malicious JSON to an application that uses Jackson for deserialization.  No other specific capabilities are mentioned, but this attack vector requires some understanding of how jackson-databind works internally and which gadget classes are available.",
  }
