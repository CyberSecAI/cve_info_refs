- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the Intel(R) LED Manager for NUC subsystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper authentication mechanisms, allowing privileged users to trigger a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged user with local access can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, requiring a privileged user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a privileged user and have local access to the system.
