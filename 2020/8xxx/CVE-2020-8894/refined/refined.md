Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) handles Access Control Lists (ACLs) for discussion threads. Specifically, when an event is shared with a particular distribution group, the system incorrectly allowed all users of the MISP instance to view the thread and add new posts, regardless of their authorization for the event itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect ACL Enforcement:**  The core issue is the failure to properly enforce ACLs on discussion threads. Sharing an event with a distribution group did not restrict access to the associated discussion thread to members of that group.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This led to a situation where users who were not intended to have access to the discussion could view and contribute to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive information discussed within the threads.
- **Unauthorized Modification:** Attackers can post new entries into discussion threads they should not have access to.
- **Compromise of Confidentiality:** Sensitive discussions pertaining to specific events could be exposed to a wider audience, potentially impacting confidentiality.
- **Compromise of Integrity:** Attackers might be able to influence discussion threads with misleading information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of MISP.
- **User Account:** Any authenticated user of a MISP instance could exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on a MISP instance.
- No elevated privileges are required to exploit this issue.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in MISP version 2.4.120 and fixed in 2.4.121
- The fix implemented stricter checks for thread access based on user authorization and the associated event's distribution.
- The fix involved modifications in `app/Controller/ThreadsController.php` and `app/Model/Thread.php`. The changes can be viewed in the provided git commit link.

**CVE Information:**
- CVE ID: CVE-2020-8894
