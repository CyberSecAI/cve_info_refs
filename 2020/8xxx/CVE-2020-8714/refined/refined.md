Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper authentication in some Intel(R) Server Boards, Server Systems and Compute Modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication mechanisms in the affected systems. This allows unauthorized access and potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to **privilege escalation**, allowing an attacker to gain higher-level access within the system. There is also a potential for **disclosure of sensitive information**, or a **Denial of Service**.
- Specifically for CVE-2020-8714, the impact is limited to **potential for escalation of privilege** and **disclosure of sensitive information**.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **local access**. This means that the attacker must have some level of access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be authenticated with low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Intel Server Boards, Systems, and Compute Modules before version 1.59.
- NetApp products that incorporate these vulnerable Intel components are also affected.
- NetApp has marked NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage as "Won't Fix".
- Intel's advisory states this vulnerability was discovered internally by Michael N. Henry of Intel's DCG Red Team.
