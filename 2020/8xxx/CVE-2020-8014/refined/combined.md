By watching for the change in /var/log/kopano I can easily time when to change /var/lib/kopano/spamd to a symlink.

In that case we'll post a comment here setting the new date.  Only a member of the security team is allowed to make this issue public. Please speak to us if you want to take part in  the public disclosure.

Is it the scriptlet chown/chmod? Is there other issues outside the specfile? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1164131#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2020-02-18 16:09:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Engelhardt from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1164131#c2)) The usage of chown in the user controlled path is the issue 302 chown kopano:kopano /var/lib/kopano/spamd 2>/dev/null || :  For the recursive chown there's another bug, but that will not receive a CVE since it's not exploitable on default systems ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1164131#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2020-02-25 07:37:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Engelhardt from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1164131#c2)) Sorry for the confusion. I made [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1164131#c0) public.
