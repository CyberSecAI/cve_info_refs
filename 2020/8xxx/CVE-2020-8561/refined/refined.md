Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8561:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-8561. The provided Google Groups post explicitly mentions the CVE ID and describes the vulnerability. The NetApp advisories also reference this CVE, and indicate its presence in Kubernetes.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   *   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of actors controlling the responses of `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` or `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` requests to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver.

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
        *   **Webhook Redirection:** The core vulnerability is the insecure handling of webhook responses, allowing redirects to internal networks.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** If `--profiling` is enabled and the apiserver's log level is set to 10, sensitive information can be exposed within the logs during the redirection, including the redirected responses and headers.

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers with access to kube-apiserver logs (when the log level is set to 10) can potentially view sensitive information from the redirected responses and headers. The NetApp advisory states successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.
        *   **Private Network Access:** Attackers could potentially access resources or services within the apiserver's private network by redirecting requests. The information disclosure aspect is dependent upon logging level.

   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Webhook Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the responses of  `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` or `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` requests to redirect internal traffic.
        *   **Log Analysis:**  If  `--profiling` is enabled, log responses when verbosity is set to 10 are analyzed to obtain the redirected response.

   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   **Control Over Webhooks:** Attackers must have the ability to control the responses of `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` or `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` requests.
        *   **Access to Logs (Conditional):**  To exploit the information disclosure aspect, the attacker needs access to kube-apiserver process logs, specifically when the log level is set to 10.
        *   **High Privileges:** The CVSS vector implies that attackers need high privileges to successfully exploit this vulnerability `(PR:H)`

**3. Additional Notes:**
    *   The vulnerability affects all known versions of kube-apiserver.
    *   There is no fix for this vulnerability at the time of the report and mitigation is focused on configuration changes
    *   Detection of the vulnerability is dependent upon examination of kube-apiserver log responses.
    *   NetApp indicates that while multiple of their products use Kubernetes, none are affected by this vulnerability.

**4. Summary of Technical Details and Descriptions:**

The technical descriptions provided by the source material are very detailed and thorough. They include:

*   The vulnerability's root cause (webhook redirection).
*   The impact (potential for information disclosure and private network access).
*   Attack vectors (webhook manipulation, log analysis)
*   Affected versions (all known versions of kube-apiserver).
*   Mitigations (setting the `--profiling` flag to false and using a lower log verbosity level).

The GitHub issue also provides context to the vulnerability including that it was reported by QiQi Xu.

**5. Content that provides more detail than the official CVE description:**

The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, specifically:

*   The Google Groups post provides a complete write-up of the vulnerability.
*   The NetApp advisories confirm the existence of this vulnerability in some of their products, including versions 1.20.11, 1.21.5, and 1.22.2, and provide details of how to detect and mitigate this vulnerability.
*  The GitHub issue explicitly outlines the requirements to trigger this vulnerability including enabling the `--profiling` flag, log verbosity of 10 and having access to logs.
