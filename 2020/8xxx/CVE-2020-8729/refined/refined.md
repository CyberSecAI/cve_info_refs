Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-8729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer copy operation within the firmware of certain Intel server products where the size of the input is not checked before the copy, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Copy Without Size Check:** The core issue is the lack of validation of the input size before copying data into a buffer. This allows for the potential of writing beyond the buffer's allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation could potentially allow an attacker to gain higher-level access privileges than initially authorized on the system.
- **Potential Data Modification:** Although the CVSS score indicates a low confidentiality impact, the potential for modification (Integrity impact - Low) due to buffer overflow could be present.
- **Denial of Service:** A low Availability impact is reported, indicating that a successful attack could result in a limited denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the target system to trigger the vulnerable code.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs physical or remote access to the system on which the vulnerable firmware is running.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Intel Server Boards, Server Systems, and Compute Modules.
- The vulnerability is present in firmware versions prior to 1.59.
- The CVSS score is 4.4, which indicates a Medium severity.
- NetApp products such as NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage are also affected due to the Intel technology they incorporate. However, there are no plans to fix this vulnerability on these products due to end-of-life status.
