|  | Kia Motors Head Unit with Software version: SOP.003.30.18.0703, SOP.005.7.181019, SOP.007.1.191209 may allow |
|  | an attacker to inject unauthorized commands, by executing the micomd |
|  | executable deamon, to trigger unintended functionalities. In addition, |
|  | this executable may be used by an attacker to inject commands to |
|  | generate CAN frames that are sent into the M-CAN bus (Multimedia CAN bus) of |
|  | the vehicle. |
