  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure permissions of the `micomd` executable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `micomd` executable allows unauthorized command injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject commands to trigger unintended functionalities of the head unit and send crafted CAN frames to the M-CAN bus, potentially altering vehicle behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted commands to the `micomd` executable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the head unit is required to send the crafted commands."
