# Excessive CPU and/or memory usage when proxying HTTP/1.1

High

[lizan](/lizan)
published
GHSA-jwcm-4pwp-c2qv
Mar 3, 2020

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

< 1.13.0

## Patched versions

1.13.1, 1.12.3

## Description

## Vulnerability type

CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

## Attack type

Remote

## Impact

Denial-of-service, Resource consumption (memory)

## Affected component(s)

HTTP/1 codec, Connection buffer

## Attack vector(s)

A HTTP/1.1 request or response with many small (i.e. 1 byte) chunks.

## Discoverer(s)/Credits

Wenlei (Frank) He (Google LLC)

## Description (full; not included in CVE but will be published on GitHub later and linked)

Envoy version 1.13.0 or earlier may consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/1.1 requests or responses with many small (i.e. 1 byte) chunks. Envoy allocates a separate buffer fragment for each incoming or outgoing chunk with the size rounded to the nearest 4Kb and does not release empty chunks after committing data. As such processing requests or responses with a lot of small chunks may result in extremely high memory overhead while proxying. The memory overhead could be two to three orders of magnitude more than configured buffer limits.

### Severity

  over whether unknown fields are rejected in static and dynamic configuration. By default, unknown
  fields in static configuration are rejected and are allowed in dynamic configuration. Warnings
  are logged for the first use of any unknown field and these occurrences are counted in the
  [server.static\_unknown\_fields](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/observability/statistics#server-statistics) and [server.dynamic\_unknown\_fields](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/observability/statistics#server-statistics) statistics.

This is a change in behaviour in the sense that Envoy will move to the next initialization phase, even if the first config is not delivered in 15s. Refer to [initialization process](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/operations/init#arch-overview-initialization) for more details.
* config: added stat [init\_fetch\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cds#config-cluster-manager-cds).

* upstream: added [upstream\_cx\_pool\_overflow](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#config-cluster-manager-cluster-stats) for the connection pool circuit breaker.
* upstream: an EDS management server can now force removal of a host that is still passing active
  health checking by first marking the host as failed via EDS health check and subsequently removing
  it in a future update. This is a mechanism to work around a race condition in which an EDS
  implementation may remove a host before it has stopped passing active HC, thus causing the host
  to become stranded until a future update.
* upstream: added [an option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-commonlbconfig-ignore-new-hosts-until-first-hc)
  that allows ignoring new hosts for the purpose of load balancing calculations until they have
  been health checked for the first time.
* upstream: added runtime error checking to prevent setting dns type to STRICT\_DNS or LOGICAL\_DNS when custom resolver name is specified.
* upstream: added possibility to override fallback\_policy per specific selector in [subset load balancer](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/subsets#arch-overview-load-balancer-subsets).
* upstream: the [logical DNS cluster](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/service_discovery#arch-overview-service-discovery-types-logical-dns) now
  displays the current resolved IP address in admin output instead of 0.0.0.0.

  and the number of faults the overflowed.
* fault: added [response rate limit](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-fault-v2-httpfault-response-rate-limit) fault injection.
* fault: added [HTTP header fault configuration](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/fault_filter#config-http-filters-fault-injection-http-header) to the HTTP fault filter.
* governance: extending Envoy deprecation policy from 1 release (0-3 months) to 2 releases (3-6 months).

* http: added support for a [request timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-request-timeout). The timeout is disabled by default.
* http: no longer adding whitespace when appending X-Forwarded-For headers. **Warning**: this is not
  compatible with 1.7.0 builds prior to [9d3a4eb4ac44be9f0651fcc7f87ad98c538b01ee](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/3610).
  See [#3611](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/3611) for details.
* http: augmented the sendLocalReply filter API to accept an optional GrpcStatus
  value to override the default HTTP to gRPC status mapping.
* http: no longer close the TCP connection when a HTTP/1 request is retried due
  to a response with empty body.
* http: added support for more gRPC content-type headers in [gRPC bridge filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/grpc_http1_bridge_filter#config-http-filters-grpc-bridge), like application/grpc+proto.
* listeners: all listener filters are now governed by the [listener\_filters\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-listener-filters-timeout) setting. The hard coded 15s timeout in
  the [TLS inspector listener filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/listener_filters/tls_inspector#config-listener-filters-tls-inspector) is superseded by
  this setting.
* listeners: added the ability to match [FilterChain](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-listener-filterchain) using [source\_type](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-source-type).
* load balancer: added a configuration <envoy\_api\_msg\_Cluster.LeastRequestLbConfig> option to specify the number of choices made in P2C.
* logging: added missing [ in log prefix.
* mongo\_proxy: added [dynamic metadata](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mongo_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mongo-proxy-dynamic-metadata).
* network: removed the reference to FilterState in Connection in favor of StreamInfo.
* rate-limit: added [configuration](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/rate_limit/v2/rate_limit.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-rate-limit-v2-ratelimit-rate-limited-as-resource-exhausted)
  to specify whether the GrpcStatus status returned should be RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED or
  UNAVAILABLE when a gRPC call is rate limited.
* rate-limit: removed support for the legacy ratelimit service and made the data-plane-api
  [rls.proto](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto#envoy-api-file-envoy-service-ratelimit-v2-rls-proto) based implementation default.
* rate-limit: removed the deprecated cluster\_name attribute in [rate limit service configuration](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto#envoy-api-file-envoy-config-ratelimit-v2-rls-proto).
* rate-limit: added [rate\_limit\_service](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/rate_limit/v2/rate_limit.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-http-rate-limit-v2-ratelimit) configuration to filters.
* rbac: added dynamic metadata to the network level filter.
* rbac: added support for permission matching by [requested server name](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/rbac/v2/rbac.proto#envoy-api-field-config-rbac-v2-permission-requested-server-name).
* redis: static cluster configuration is no longer required. Redis proxy will work with clusters
  delivered via CDS.
* router: added ability to configure arbitrary [retriable status codes.](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-retrypolicy-retriable-status-codes)
* router: added ability to set attempt count in upstream requests, see [virtual host’s include request
  attempt count flag](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-virtualhost-include-request-attempt-count).
* router: added internal [grpc-retry-on](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-retry-grpc-on) policy.
* router: added [scheme\_redirect](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-redirectaction-scheme-redirect) and
  [port\_redirect](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-redirectaction-port-redirect) to define the respective
  scheme and port rewriting RedirectAction.
* router: when [max\_grpc\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-max-grpc-timeout)
  is set, Envoy will now add or update the grpc-timeout header to reflect Envoy’s expected timeout.
* router: per try timeouts now starts when an upstream stream is ready instead of when the request has
  been fully decoded by Envoy.
* router: added support for not retrying [rate limited requests](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-ratelimited). Rate limit filter now sets the [x-envoy-ratelimited](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-ratelimited)
  header so the rate limited requests that may have been retried earlier will not be retried with this change.
* router: added support for enabling upgrades on a [per-route](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-upgrade-configs) basis.
* router: support configuring a default fraction of mirror traffic via
  [runtime\_fraction](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-requestmirrorpolicy-runtime-key).
* sandbox: added [cors sandbox](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/start/sandboxes/cors#install-sandboxes-cors).
* server: added SIGINT (Ctrl-C) handler to gracefully shutdown Envoy like SIGTERM.
* stats: added [stats\_matcher](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-field-config-metrics-v2-statsconfig-stats-matcher) to the bootstrap config for granular control of stat instantiation.
* stream: renamed the RequestInfo namespace to StreamInfo to better match
  its behaviour within TCP and HTTP implementations.
* stream: renamed perRequestState to filterState in StreamInfo.
* stream: added downstreamDirectRemoteAddress to StreamInfo.
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift rate limiter filter.
* tls: added ssl.curves.<curve>, ssl.sigalgs.<sigalg> and ssl.versions.<version> to
  [listener metrics](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/stats#config-listener-stats) to track TLS algorithms and versions in use.
* tls: added support for [client-side session resumption](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/auth/cert.proto#envoy-api-field-auth-upstreamtlscontext-max-session-keys).
* tls: added support for CRLs in [trusted\_ca](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/auth/cert.proto#envoy-api-field-auth-certificatevalidationcontext-trusted-ca).
* tls: added support for [multiple server TLS certificates](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/security/ssl#arch-overview-ssl-cert-select).
* tls: added support for [password encrypted private keys](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/auth/cert.proto#envoy-api-field-auth-tlscertificate-password).
* tls: added the ability to build [BoringSSL FIPS](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/security/ssl#arch-overview-ssl-fips) using `--define boringssl=fips` Bazel option.
* tls: removed support for ECDSA certificates with curves other than P-256.
* tls: removed support for RSA certificates with keys smaller than 2048-bits.
* tracing: added support to the Zipkin tracer for the [b3](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-b3) single header format.
* tracing: added support for [Datadog](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/observability/tracing#arch-overview-tracing) tracer.
* upstream: added [scale\_locality\_weight](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-lbsubsetconfig-scale-locality-weight) to enable
  scaling locality weights by number of hosts removed by subset lb predicates.
* upstream: changed how load calculation for [priority levels](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/priority#arch-overview-load-balancing-priority-levels) and [panic thresholds](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/panic_threshold#arch-overview-load-balancing-panic-threshold) interact. As long as normalized total health is 100% panic thresholds are disregarded.
* upstream: changed the default hash for [ring hash](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-msg-cluster-ringhashlbconfig) from std::hash to [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash).
* upstream: when using active health checking and STRICT\_DNS with several addresses that resolve
  to the same hosts, Envoy will now health check each host independently.

## 1.8.0 (Oct 4, 2018)[¶](#oct-4-2018 "Permalink to this headline")

* access log: added [response flag filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-accesslog-v2-responseflagfilter)
  to filter based on the presence of Envoy response flags.
* access log: added RESPONSE\_DURATION and RESPONSE\_TX\_DURATION.
* access log: added REQUESTED\_SERVER\_NAME for SNI to tcp\_proxy and http
* admin: added [`GET /hystrix_event_stream`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#get--hystrix_event_stream "GET /hystrix_event_stream") as an endpoint for monitoring envoy’s statistics
  through [Hystrix dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/hystrix-dashboard/wiki).

  health check/weight/metadata updates within the given duration.
* config: regex validation added to limit to a maximum of 1024 characters.
* config: v1 disabled by default. v1 support remains available until October via flipping –v2-config-only=false.
* config: v1 disabled by default. v1 support remains available until October via deprecated flag –allow-deprecated-v1-api.
* config: fixed stat inconsistency between xDS and ADS implementation. [update\_failure](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cds#config-cluster-manager-cds)
  stat is incremented in case of network failure and [update\_rejected](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cds#config-cluster-manager-cds) stat is incremented
  in case of schema/validation error.
* config: added a stat [connected\_state](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/overview/mgmt_server#management-server-stats) that indicates current connected state of Envoy with
  management server.
* ext\_authz: added support for configuring additional [authorization headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-authorizationrequest-headers-to-add)
  to be sent from Envoy to the authorization service.
* fault: added support for fractional percentages in [FaultDelay](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-fault-v2-faultdelay-percentage)
  and in [FaultAbort](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-fault-v2-faultabort-percentage).
* grpc-json: added support for building HTTP response from
  [google.api.HttpBody](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto).

* health\_check: added support for [health check event logging](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/health_checking#arch-overview-health-check-logging).
* health\_check: added [timestamp](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/data/core/v2alpha/health_check_event.proto#envoy-api-field-data-core-v2alpha-healthcheckevent-timestamp)
  to the [health check event](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/data/core/v2alpha/health_check_event.proto#envoy-api-msg-data-core-v2alpha-healthcheckevent) definition.
* health\_check: added support for specifying [custom request headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers)
  to HTTP health checker requests.
* http: added support for a [per-stream idle timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-idle-timeout). This applies at both [connection manager](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-stream-idle-timeout)
  and [per-route granularity](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-idle-timeout). The timeout
  defaults to 5 minutes; if you have other timeouts (e.g. connection idle timeout, upstream
  response per-retry) that are longer than this in duration, you may want to consider setting a
  non-default per-stream idle timeout.
* http: added upstream\_rq\_completed counter for [total requests completed](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#config-cluster-manager-cluster-stats-dynamic-http) to dynamic HTTP counters.
* http: added downstream\_rq\_completed counter for [total requests completed](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/stats#config-http-conn-man-stats), including on a [per-listener basis](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/stats#config-http-conn-man-stats-per-listener).
* http: added generic [Upgrade support](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-upgrade-configs).
* http: better handling of HEAD requests. Now sending transfer-encoding: chunked rather than content-length: 0.
* http: fixed missing support for appending to predefined inline headers, e.g.
  *authorization*, in features that interact with request and response headers,
  e.g. [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-add). For example, a
  request header *authorization: token1* will appear as *authorization:
  token1,token2*, after having [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-add) with *authorization:
  token2* applied.
* http: response filters not applied to early error paths such as http\_parser generated 400s.
* http: restrictions added to reject *:*-prefixed pseudo-headers in [custom
  request headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers).
* http: [hpack\_table\_size](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/core/protocol.proto#envoy-api-field-core-http2protocoloptions-hpack-table-size) now controls
  dynamic table size of both: encoder and decoder.
* http: added support for removing request headers using [request\_headers\_to\_remove](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-remove).
* http: added support for a [delayed close timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-delayed-close-timeout) to mitigate race conditions when closing connections to downstream HTTP clients. The timeout defaults to 1 second.
* jwt-authn filter: add support for per route JWT requirements.
* listeners: added the ability to match [FilterChain](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-listener-filterchain) using
  [destination\_port](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-destination-port) and
  [prefix\_ranges](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-prefix-ranges).

* lua: added [streamInfo()](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/lua_filter#config-http-filters-lua-stream-info-wrapper) wrapper and *protocol()* API.
* lua: added [streamInfo():dynamicMetadata()](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/lua_filter#config-http-filters-lua-stream-info-dynamic-metadata-wrapper) API.
* network: introduced [sni\_cluster](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/sni_cluster_filter#config-network-filters-sni-cluster) network filter that forwards connections to the
  upstream cluster specified by the SNI value presented by the client during a TLS handshake.
* proxy\_protocol: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol v2 (AF\_INET/AF\_INET6 only).
* ratelimit: added support for [api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1/api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto).
  Lyft’s reference implementation of the [ratelimit](https://github.com/lyft/ratelimit) service also supports the data-plane-api proto as of v1.1.0.
  Envoy can use either proto to send client requests to a ratelimit server with the use of the
  use\_data\_plane\_proto boolean flag in the ratelimit configuration.
  Support for the legacy proto source/common/ratelimit/ratelimit.proto is deprecated and will be removed at the start of the 1.9.0 release cycle.
* ratelimit: added [failure\_mode\_deny](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/rate_limit/v2/rate_limit.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-http-rate-limit-v2-ratelimit) option to control traffic flow in
  case of rate limit service error.
* rbac config: added a [principal\_name](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/rbac/v2/rbac.proto#envoy-api-field-config-rbac-v2-principal-authenticated-principal-name) field and
  removed the old name field to give more flexibility for matching certificate identity.
* rbac network filter: a [role-based access control network filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/rbac_filter#config-network-filters-rbac) has been added.
* rest-api: added ability to set the [request timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/core/config_source.proto#envoy-api-field-core-apiconfigsource-request-timeout) for REST API requests.
* route checker: added v2 config support and removed support for v1 configs.
* router: added ability to set request/response headers at the [route.Route](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-route) level.
* stats: added [option to configure the DogStatsD metric name prefix](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-field-config-metrics-v2-dogstatsdsink-prefix) to DogStatsdSink.
* tcp\_proxy: added support for [weighted clusters](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/tcp_proxy/v2/tcp_proxy.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-tcp-proxy-v2-tcpproxy-weighted-clusters).
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift routing, moved configuration to correct location
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift configurable decoder filters
* tls: implemented [Secret Discovery Service](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/security/secret#config-secret-discovery-service).
* tracing: added support for configuration of [tracing sampling](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-tracing).
* upstream: added configuration option to the subset load balancer to take locality weights into account when
  selecting a host from a subset.
* upstream: require opt-in to use the [x-envoy-original-dst-host](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-x-envoy-original-dst-host) header
  for overriding destination address when using the [Original Destination](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/original_dst#arch-overview-load-balancing-types-original-destination)
  load balancing policy.

* admin: removed /routes endpoint; route configs can now be found at the [/config\_dump endpoint](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-config-dump).
* buffer filter: the buffer filter can be optionally
  [disabled](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/buffer/v2/buffer.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-buffer-v2-bufferperroute-disabled) or
  [overridden](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/buffer/v2/buffer.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-buffer-v2-bufferperroute-buffer) with
  route-local configuration.
* cli: added –config-yaml flag to the Envoy binary. When set its value is interpreted as a yaml
  representation of the bootstrap config and overrides –config-path.
* cluster: added [option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-close-connections-on-host-health-failure)
  to close tcp\_proxy upstream connections when health checks fail.
* cluster: added [option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-drain-connections-on-host-removal) to drain
  connections from hosts after they are removed from service discovery, regardless of health status.
* cluster: fixed bug preventing the deletion of all endpoints in a priority
* debug: added symbolized stack traces (where supported)

  already been proxied downstream when the timeout occurs. Previously, the response would be reset
  leading to either an HTTP/2 reset or an HTTP/1 closed connection and a partial response. Now, the
  timeout will be ignored and the response will continue to proxy up to the global request timeout.

  NamedHttpFilterConfigFactory.
* Many small bug fixes and performance improvements not listed.

## 1.3.0 (May 17, 2017)[¶](#may-17-2017 "Permalink to this headline")

* As of this release, we now have an official [breaking change policy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-change-policy). Note that there are numerous breaking configuration
  changes in this release. They are not listed here. Future releases will adhere to the policy and
  have clear documentation on deprecations and changes.
* Bazel is now the canonical build system (replacing CMake). There have been a huge number of
  changes to the development/build/test flow. See [/bazel/README.md](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//bazel/README.md) and
  [/ci/README.md](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//ci/README.md) for more information.
* [Outlier detection](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/outlier#arch-overview-outlier-detection) has been expanded to include success
  rate variance, and all parameters are now configurable in both runtime and in the JSON
  configuration.
* TCP level listener and cluster connections now have configurable receive buffer
  limits at which point connection level back pressure is applied.
  Full end to end flow control will be available in a future release.
* [Redis health checking](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_hc#config-cluster-manager-cluster-hc) has been added as an active
  health check type. Full Redis support will be documented/supported in 1.4.0.
* [TCP health checking](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_hc#config-cluster-manager-cluster-hc-tcp-health-checking) now supports a
  “connect only” mode that only checks if the remote server can be connected to without
  writing/reading any data.

  The default cipher suites and ECDH curves have been updated with more modern defaults for both
  listener and cluster connections.
* The header value match rate limit action has been expanded to include an expect
  match parameter.
* Route level HTTP rate limit configurations now do not inherit the virtual host level
  configurations by default. Use include\_vh\_rate\_limits to inherit the virtual host
  level options if desired.
* HTTP routes can now add request headers on a per route and per virtual host basis via the
  [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers) option.
* The [example configurations](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/install/ref_configs#install-ref-configs) have been refreshed to demonstrate the
  latest features.
* per\_try\_timeout\_ms can now be configured in
  a route’s retry policy in addition to via the [x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms) HTTP header.
* HTTP virtual host matching now includes support for prefix wildcard domains (e.g., \*.lyft.com).
* The default for tracing random sampling has been changed to 100% and is still configurable in
  [runtime](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/runtime#config-http-conn-man-runtime).
* HTTP tracing configuration has been extended to allow tags
  to be populated from arbitrary HTTP headers.
* The [HTTP rate limit filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/rate_limit_filter#config-http-filters-rate-limit) can now be applied to internal,
  external, or all requests via the request\_type option.
* [Listener binding](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/listeners#config-listeners) now requires specifying an address field. This can be
  used to bind a listener to both a specific address as well as a port.
* The [MongoDB filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mongo_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mongo-proxy) now emits a stat for queries that
  do not have $maxTimeMS set.
* The [MongoDB filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mongo_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mongo-proxy) now emits logs that are fully valid
  JSON.
* The CPU profiler output path is now configurable.
* A watchdog system has been added that can kill the server if a deadlock is detected.
* A [route table checking tool](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/install/tools/route_table_check_tool#install-tools-route-table-check-tool) has been added that can
  be used to test route tables before use.
* We have added an [example repo](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/extending/extending#extending) that shows how to compile/link a custom filter.
* Added additional cluster wide information related to outlier detection to the [/clusters
  admin endpoint](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface).
* Multiple SANs can now be verified via the verify\_subject\_alt\_name setting.
  Additionally, URI type SANs can be verified.
* HTTP filters can now be passed opaque configuration specified on a per route basis.
* By default Envoy now has a built in crash handler that will print a back trace. This behavior can
  be disabled if desired via the `--define=signal_trace=disabled` Bazel option.
* Zipkin has been added as a supported [tracing provider](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/observability/tracing#arch-overview-tracing).
* Numerous small changes and fixes not listed here.

Package        : elog
Version        : 3.1.2-1-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-8659

A vulnerability was reported in src:elog, a logbook system to manage
notes through a Web interface. This vulnerability allows remote
attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected
installations of ELOG Electronic Logbook. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists
within the processing of HTTP parameters. A crafted request can
trigger the dereference of a null pointer. An attacker can leverage
this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
3.1.2-1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your elog packages.

For the detailed security status of elog please refer to
its security tracker page at:

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1802545#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-02-13 11:51:58 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Envoy. where TLS inspector could have been bypassed (not recognized as a TLS client) by a client using only TLS 1.3. Because TLS extensions (SNI, ALPN) were not inspected, those connections might have been matched to a wrong filter chain, possibly bypassing some security restrictions in the process.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1802545#c2)  Mark Cooper    2020-02-24 04:41:46 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: The Envoy Security Team   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1802545#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-05 19:00:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenShift Service Mesh 1.0  Via RHSA-2020:0734 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0734](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0734)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1802545#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-05 22:31:50 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
