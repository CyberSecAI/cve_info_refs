Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2020-8555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `kube-controller-manager` component of Kubernetes.
*   The vulnerability arises because the `kube-controller-manager` makes requests to user-supplied URLs without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `kube-controller-manager` is vulnerable to SSRF, allowing a malicious user to force the component to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Lack of URL Validation:** The `kube-controller-manager` does not properly validate user-supplied URLs before making requests.
*   **Unauthenticated Requests:** Requests made by `kube-controller-manager` do not include any client credentials. This can allow access to services that may only be intended for use within the cluster's private network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to leak up to 500 bytes of arbitrary information from unprotected endpoints within the Kubernetes master's host network.
*   **Access to Internal Services:** The attacker can potentially access link-local metadata endpoints, unauthenticated services listening on localhost (if enabled), or other services in the master's private network. This might include secrets from the kube-apiserver through the unauthenticated localhost port.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker with the ability to create a pod with specific vulnerable volume types.
*   An attacker with the ability to create or modify a StorageClass object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient permissions.
*   **Pod Creation/StorageClass Modification Privileges:** The attacker must have the ability to create pods with specific volume types (GlusterFS, Quobyte, StorageOS, ScaleIO) or to create or modify StorageClass objects.
*   **Network Access to Master:** The attacker doesn't require network access to the control plane, but relies on the `kube-controller-manager` to make the requests for them.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.18.0
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.17.0 - v1.17.4
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.16.0 - v1.16.8
    *   `kube-controller-manager` <= v1.15.11
*   **Fixed Versions:**
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.18.1+
    *  `kube-controller-manager` v1.17.5+
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.16.9+
    *   `kube-controller-manager` v1.15.12+
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Add endpoint protections on the master (restrict access to sensitive services).
    *   Restrict usage of the vulnerable volume types using a PodSecurityPolicy or admission controller.
    *   Restrict StorageClass write permissions using RBAC.
*   **CVSS Score:**
    *   CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (Medium severity)
    *   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (Medium severity)
*   **Acknowledgements:**
    *   Brice Augras from Groupe-Asten and Christophe Hauquiert from Nokia reported the vulnerability to the Kubernetes Product Security Committee.
*   **Red Hat OpenShift:** Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.2 and later do not expose `kube-apiserver` through an unauthenticated localhost port, however, other link-local addresses are reachable without authentication, enabling access to sensitive data using this vulnerability. OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 is also affected.
*   **NetApp Products:** NetApp has stated that their products were not affected.

In summary, this CVE describes an SSRF vulnerability in Kubernetes that allows attackers with limited privileges to potentially access sensitive data from the master's network by leveraging the `kube-controller-manager` and specific volume types or `StorageClass` configurations, highlighting the importance of limiting access to internal services, using secure configurations, and applying the provided patches.
