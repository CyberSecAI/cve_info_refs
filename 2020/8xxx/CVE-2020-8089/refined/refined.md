Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Group Name" field on the "group_list" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the unsanitized user input directly into the database, and it's later rendered in the context of other users' browsers without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of other users who view the "Groups" page.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Defacing the website
- The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web interface where an authenticated user with the proper privileges can add a new group.
- The attacker injects the malicious payload within the "Group Name" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to add or modify groups. This usually means a user with administrator privileges is required.
- No other special conditions or requirements were mentioned.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable component: "Group Name" field in "group\_list" page.
- Piwigo version: 2.10.1
- Payload Example: `<img src=X onerror=alert(document.domain)>`
- The provided HTTP POST request shows the injection happening via the `groupname` parameter
- The issue was fixed in version 2.10.2, based on the assigned milestone.
