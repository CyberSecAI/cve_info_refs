The provided content relates to CVE-2020-8911.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The AWS S3 Crypto SDK for Golang, version 1, uses AES-CBC encryption without a message authentication code (MAC). This allows an attacker to exploit a padding oracle vulnerability by manipulating the ciphertext and observing whether decryption succeeds or fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Padding Oracle:** The use of CBC mode without a MAC allows an attacker to manipulate the ciphertext, specifically the padding bytes, and observe decryption errors to reconstruct the plaintext data. This is due to the way PKCS#5 padding works.
*  **Lack of Integrity Check:** The lack of a MAC means there's no way to detect if the ciphertext has been tampered with.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Plaintext recovery:** An attacker can reconstruct the plaintext of encrypted files, even without access to the encryption key, using the padding oracle attack.
*   **Message forgery:** By manipulating the ciphertext, an attacker could potentially modify the decrypted content.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Write access to S3 bucket:** The attacker needs to be able to upload or modify files in the S3 bucket.
*   **Oracle access:** The attacker needs to have access to an endpoint that performs decryption and reveals if the decryption was successful (e.g. through error messages or other side-channels). The actual plaintext is not revealed by the oracle, only the success or failure of decryption.
*  **CBC mode encryption**: The target files must be encrypted using AES-CBC mode. Files encrypted with AES-GCM are not vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have write access to the S3 bucket.
*   The attacker must have the ability to trigger the decryption of the files they are modifying.
*   The attacker must have a method to observe whether or not the decryption attempt was successful, without needing access to the plaintext.
*   The attacker must know that CBC was used during the encryption process.

**Additional details:**
*   The exploit requires (on average) `128*length(plaintext)` queries to the endpoint.
*   The vulnerability affects version 1 of the AWS S3 Crypto SDK for Golang. Version 2 disables encryption with CBC mode for new files, mitigating the vulnerability.
*   Existing files encrypted with CBC remain vulnerable unless re-encrypted with AES-GCM.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available in a separate GitHub repository: `https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc`.
*   The issue is also present in non-strict versions of the C++ and Java S3 Crypto SDKs.
*   This vulnerability is different from [CVE-2020-8912](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw), which is related to AES-GCM.
