The provided content is related to CVE-2020-8226.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Previous versions of phpBB allowed limiting the dimensions of images posted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The ability to limit image dimensions could be exploited to probe for the existence of services that should only be accessible from the internal network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to identify internal services not meant to be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could post images with specific dimensions, observing the response (e.g., if the server processes and resizes the image) to determine the presence of internal services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to post images to a phpBB forum.
