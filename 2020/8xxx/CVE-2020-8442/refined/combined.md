### @cpu **[cpu](/cpu)** commented [Jan 16, 2020](#issue-551068971)

The `RK_File` function of the rootcheck decoder needs to ensure it doesn't index outside of `MAX_AGENTS` when trying to find/open a rootcheck file for a given agent.

Prev. to this change the value of `i` could exceed `MAX_AGENTS` resulting in a heap buffer overflow accessing `rk_agent_ips[i]` or `rk_agent_fps[i]`.

The fix is adapted from similar logic in the syscheck decoder, added as a response to a matching vulnerability in that decoder patched in 2012.

# CVE-2020-8447: analysisd: OS\_ReadMSG heap use-after-free decoding syscheck msgs. #1818

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1818#issue-550426963)

The `ossec-analysisd`'s `OS_ReadMSG` function calls `OS_CleanMSG` at the start of processing a message read from the ossec queue UNIX domain socket.

In `src/analysisd/cleanevent.c` the `OS_CleanMSG` function populates the `lf` struct, setting fields like `log`, `hostname` and `program_name` to substrings of the `lf->full_log` buffer.

After cleaning any syscheck messages are given to the syscheck decoder for further processing.

After processing a syscheck msg from a client the syscheck decoder will free the `lf->full_log` pointer in two places. One place is if the message indicated a change in an existing tracked file:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c#L572-L576)

Lines 572 to 576
in
[60cf8d2](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92)

|  | /\* Create a new log message \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | free(lf->full\_log); |
|  | os\_strdup(sdb.comment, lf->full\_log); |
|  | lf->log = lf->full\_log; |
|  | lf->data = NULL; |

Another place is if the message indicated a new file to track:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92/src/analysisd/decoders/syscheck.c#L601-L604)

Lines 601 to 604
in
[60cf8d2](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92)

|  | /\* Create a new log message \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | free(lf->full\_log); |
|  | os\_strdup(sdb.comment, lf->full\_log); |
|  | lf->log = lf->full\_log; |

In both cases the syscheck decoder replaces the existing `lf->log` and `lf->full_log` pointers with pointers to new messages after first freeing the old `lf->full_log`. Afterwards the `DB_Search`, and `DecodeSyscheck` functions return 1 to `OS_ReadMSG`.

Since the decoder returned 1, the `OS_ReadMSG` function will continue processing the event, it will not jump to `CLMEM`:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/analysisd.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92/src/analysisd/analysisd.c#L762-L765)

Lines 762 to 765
in
[60cf8d2](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/60cf8d2e941bcded8a05810d87cb906ff771df92)

|  | if (!DecodeSyscheck(lf)) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | /\* We don't process syscheck events further \*/ |
|  | goto CLMEM; |
|  | } |

If any subsequent processing rules access the `lf->hostname` or `lf->program_name` fields set by `OS_CleanMSG` they will be accessing memory of a freed heap chunk previously containing `lf->full_log`.

I believe the bug was introduced in [8672fa0](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/8672fa0d5acd1087c285e664804bfa455e9cfd07) on Nov 18, 2006 and affects OSSEC v2.7+.

This code path is triggerable via an authenticated client through the `ossec-remoted`. The client needs only write a valid syscheck message that will have the `program_name` or `hostname` set during `OS_CleanMSG`.

I don't have a strong sense for the possibility of exploitation. I suspect this may be turned into an out of bounds read of heap memory accessing `program_name` or `hostname` during rule processing if the area pointed to after the syscheck decoder free isn't null terminated.

One possible fix would be for the syscheck decoder to `os_strdup` the `lf->hostname` and `lf->program_name` before freeing `full_log`.

Hi folks,

I spent some free time recently auditing OSSEC. I was primarily focused on a threat model where an OSSEC agent is compromised (e.g. the agent key and assoc. counters are known) and used to attack the OSSEC server (primarily `ossec-remoted` and `ossec-analysisd`). Given the problem domain of OSSEC and HIDS generally I think this is fair game. Since these are post-auth bugs and there isn't guidance on vulnerability disclosure in the README I thought it was acceptable to post information full-disclosure to the repo.

I found a handful of bugs and have done my best to address the root cause, the affected versions, the impact and potential fixes in the issues I've filed. I will request CVEs for the security relevant bugs later on.

In terms of rough risk levels I'd categorize the findings as follows:

Some caveats/context to add:

1. I'm not a professional C coder, w.r.t suggested fixes YMMV!
2. I don't write exploits for a living. My assessments of exploitability/risk should be considered lower bounds.
3. This wasn't an extensive audit. I followed my nose and used some fuzzing.
4. OSSEC 2.7 seems to be the earliest tag in the Github repo. I didn't dig deeper into history to see if any of these bugs affect older releases (some likely do).

If you would be interested in trying to adopt fuzzing as part of your CI (or as an integration with oss-fuzz, etc) I'd be happy to try and provide some notes but likely don't have the resources to implement it myself to a merge-able standard of work.

Thanks! You can close this top-level issue as you see appropriate.

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1820#issue-550427271)

The `ossec-analysisd` rootcheck decoder (`src/analysisd/decoders/rootcheck.c`) allocates two fixed size heap buffers via global static vars. One, `rk_agent_ips` is an array of `*char` size `MAX_AGENTS`. The other `rk_agent_fps` is an array of `*FILE`, also size `MAX_AGENTS`. In a default build MAX\_AGENTS is 2048.

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/rootcheck.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/decoders/rootcheck.c#L21-L22)

|  | static char \*rk\_agent\_ips[MAX\_AGENTS]; |
| --- | --- |
|  | static FILE \*rk\_agent\_fps[MAX\_AGENTS]; |

When processing rootcheck messages the `RK_File` function is called to find a file pointer for the given agent name.

In `RK_File` a `while` loop with a index counter `i` is used to try and find an index of `rk_agent_ips` that matches the provided `agent` name.

No check of `i` is made to ensure that it stays within the bound of `MAX_AGENT`, resulting in a straight-forward heap buffer overflow when more than `MAX_AGENT` syscheck update messages for distinct agent names are processed.

This code was introduced in the original `rootcheck` functionality with [5546ed6](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/5546ed6fb97c3e507a3b3f9d571990f0a12f9d96) on Oct 9, 2005. I believe it affects OSSEC v2.7+.

This is triggerable via an authenticated client through the `ossec-remoted`. The client needs only write MAX\_AGENT rootcheck update messages with distinct message agent names.

While `ossec-remoted` always sets the agent name portion of messages passed on to `ossec-analysisd` with a prefix out of the attackers control based on the agent key and src IP (`($NAME) $SRCPIP->`) the portion after this prefix is attacker controlled and thus can be mutated to make more than MAX\_AGENT unique names that will be decoded by the `ossec-analysisd`.

Notably this bug has fairly high potential for exploitation. The attacker is able to overwrite a \*FILE pointer with a pointer to the agent name, which is mostly attacker controlled (minus a short prefix), and can be up to 255 - strlen(prefix) bytes long. I'm definitely able to reliably segfault the `ossec-analysisd` process with this bug though I was personally unable to achieve control of execution.

Overwriting a \*FILE pointer with a pointer to attacker controlled data is a common way to achieve reliable code execution. There are many pointers in the FILE struct to be abused and while libc has added some hardening it isn't applicable for versions 2.24 or lower (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04) and bypass techniques are well known.

<https://outflux.net/blog/archives/2011/12/22/abusing-the-file-structure/>

<https://dhavalkapil.com/blogs/FILE-Structure-Exploitation/>

<https://www.slideshare.net/AngelBoy1/play-with-file-structure-yet-another-binary-exploit-technique>

In this case there are two additional challenges to exploiting the bug that stumped me but may not stump someone who is actually good at writing exploits :-)

1. Since the protocol is all string based you can't use a null byte in payload that overwrites the \*FILE contents which makes specifying valid pointers on x86\_64 very challenging. (You get one terminating \0 at the end of your payload which can be used for the high order byte of a pointer, but it's still a challenge to find useful targets in high mem).
2. Getting your overwritten `rk_agent_fps` entry used with `fseek` requires being able to specify the `rk_agent_ips` name at the matching `i` value. Usually this is the first bytes of a valid `FILE` and so I *think* the attacker needs full control of the agent name to be able to specify a match (usually `\200,\255\373` or similar. The value is predictable based on rootcheck's `open` flags). If I'm correct this might mean the segfault is remotely triggerable but exploiting the FILE overwrite may not be.

To fix this the `while` conditions in `DB_File` and `DB_SetCompleted` should be rewritten to short circuit if `i >= MAX_AGENTS`:

E.g. instead of:

```
    while (i < MAX_AGENTS) {

```

Use:

```
    while (i < MAX_AGENTS && rk_agent_ips[i] != NULL) {

```

I think it's worth noting that this bug is nearly identical to the one reported by Paul Southerington in the syscheck decoder, patched in Feb 2012: [91aa29a](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/91aa29aeb84d1f125a898308a01ffbf50f4480b8)

It looks like this was fixed in Wazuh's OSSEC fork at some point, though potentially without realizing it fixed a vulnerability: <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/blob/413b72b17070350b62b2176c2bdc310cc66d30f6/src/analysisd/decoders/rootcheck.c#L77>

This seems like a place where process improvement could help. Receiving vulnerability reports should trigger a search through the codebase for equivalent problems.
