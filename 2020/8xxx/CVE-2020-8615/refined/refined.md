Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Tutor LMS plugin. Specifically, instructor approval/blocking actions were performed using GET requests, and the add new instructor functionality was vulnerable to CSRF as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The plugin did not implement sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions.
- **GET request for sensitive actions:** The use of GET requests for sensitive actions like approving or blocking instructors made it easy to trigger these actions via a crafted URL.
- **Missing nonce checks:** The plugin lacked nonce checks on key administrative functions. This was patched by adding nonce fields to the add instructor form, and validating them during instructor approval and blocking actions via ajax requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:
-   Approve themselves as an instructor on the platform.
-   Block legitimate instructors, preventing them from accessing or managing their courses.
-   If the option to create courses without admin approval was enabled, the attacker could create courses directly on the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious links:** An attacker could send a malicious link to a logged-in administrator, causing the browser to send a GET request to approve or block an instructor without the admin's knowledge.
- **Crafted forms:** An attacker could create a malicious webpage containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, would add a new instructor account under the attacker's control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no privileges other than knowledge of the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into either clicking a link or submitting a crafted form.
- The attacker does need to know or be able to guess the instructor ID in the case of using GET parameters to approve/block instructors.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Tutor LMS versions 1.5.2 and below.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.5.3 by adding nonce fields and validating them during instructor approval and blocking actions.
*   The exploit was tested and confirmed by an external security team (Astra Security) and a security researcher (Jinson Varghese Behanan).
*   The vulnerability was patched relatively quickly, with the fix being released within a week of the initial report.
