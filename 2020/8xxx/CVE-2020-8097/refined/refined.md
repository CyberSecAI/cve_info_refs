- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An untrusted search path vulnerability in `product.console.exe`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application `product.console.exe` uses an insecure search path when loading libraries. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious DLL which will be loaded by the process.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An unprivileged local attacker can escalate privileges or tamper with the productâ€™s security settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to write files to a location where the vulnerable process will attempt to load libraries from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to write files. User interaction is required by way of the legitimate user launching the vulnerable application.
