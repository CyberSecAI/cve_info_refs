- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427), also known as DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Trend Micro Password Manager searches for DLL files in an insecure manner, potentially allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by exploiting the DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs write access to a directory in the DLL search path that is searched by the application before the legitimate DLL location. They would also need to craft a malicious DLL to be loaded by the application.
