Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8115:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)
- Specifically, the query string sent to the `www/delivery/afr.php` script is printed back without proper escaping in a JavaScript context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the browser of a victim.
- On older versions of Revive Adserver (prior to v3.2.2), and under specific circumstances, it was potentially possible to steal the session identifier and gain access to the admin interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a crafted URL to the `afr.php` script with malicious JavaScript within the query string.
- The victim needs to be tricked to click on the malicious crafted URL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attack can be carried out remotely, as the `afr.php` script is publicly accessible.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The session identifier is stored in an http-only cookie as of v3.2.2, which mitigates the impact of the vulnerability in newer versions.
- The vulnerability has a "Low" risk level.
- The issue was fixed in version 5.0.4.
