# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@aledbf](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161571?u=b4ab095656b3619fd4221d7fd94e2040757dade9&v=4&size=48)[aledbf](https://github.com/aledbf)opened [on Feb 19, 2020](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/126818#issue-2475652594)

A security issue was discovered in ingress-nginx versions older than v0.28.0. The issue is of medium severity, and upgrading is encouraged to fix the vulnerability.

**Am I vulnerable?**

The vulnerability exists only if the annotation [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#authentication) is used.

**How do I upgrade?**

Follow installation instructions [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/upgrade/)

**Vulnerability Details**

A vulnerability has been discovered where a malicious user could create a new Ingress definition resulting in the replacement of the password file. The vulnerability requires that the victim namespace and/or secret use a hyphen in the name.

This scenario requires privileges in the cluster to create and read ingresses and also create secrets.

This issue is filed as [CVE-2020-8553](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhpm-74pm-hf35 "CVE-2020-8553").
