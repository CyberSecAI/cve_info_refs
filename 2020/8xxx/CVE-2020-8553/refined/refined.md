Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-8553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `ingress-nginx` component handles basic authentication configurations when a namespace or secret name contains hyphens. It allows overwriting password files used for basic authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal/File Overwrite:** The core issue appears to be related to a flaw in constructing the path to the password file when the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic` annotation is used with hyphens in the namespace or secret name. This allows an attacker to write to an arbitrary file path, specifically the password file.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The software does not adequately sanitize or handle namespace and secret names, leading to a flaw in path construction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft/Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who successfully overwrites the password file can gain unauthorized access to resources protected by basic authentication. This is because they control the credentials used to authenticate to the service.
*   **Compromise of Ingress:** The attacker may be able to take control of the ingress resource.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, as it involves creating/modifying Kubernetes resources through the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Kubernetes API Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create namespaces, read and create ingress objects, and create secrets in the Kubernetes cluster.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Configuration:** The attacker needs to know that the target ingress uses the vulnerable annotation (`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic`) and the target namespace or secret uses hyphens in its name.
*   **Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges in the Kubernetes cluster to create and read ingresses and create secrets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects `ingress-nginx` versions prior to 0.28.0. Upgrading to 0.28.0 or later resolves this issue.
*   The vulnerability is considered moderate in severity.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-73 and CWE-610, which relate to External Control of File Name or Path and External Control of a Resource Name, respectively.
