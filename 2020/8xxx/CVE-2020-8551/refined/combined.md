| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1797909#c0)  Sam Fowler    2020-02-04 08:13:26 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Kubernetes API server that allows for memory exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. A label in a Kubernetes apiserver metric that reflects the client's user agent is included for debugging purposes, but every value added adds a sustained memory overhead as the metric is now tracked. This is particularly dangerous on commonly unauthenticated APIs (selfsubjectaccessreview for example) and can be performed by any authenticated user.   Upstream Fixes:  1.18: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87669> 1.17: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87673> 1.16: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87681> 1.15: <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/87682>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1797909#c4)  Hardik Vyas    2020-02-07 13:38:15 UTC  ``` Kubernetes is embedded in the version of heketi shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.

The Kubelet has been found to be vulnerable to a denial of service attack via the kubelet API, including the unauthenticated HTTP read-only API typically served on port 10255, and the authenticated HTTPS API typically served on port 10250.

### Am I vulnerable?

If an attacker can make a request to an unpatched kubelet, then you may be vulnerable to this.

#### Affected Versions

* kubelet v1.17.0 - v1.17.2
* kubelet v1.16.0 - v1.16.6
* kubelet v1.15.0 - v1.15.9

### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

Limit access to the Kubelet API or patch the Kubelet.

#### Fixed Versions

* v1.17.3
* v1.16.7
* v1.15.10

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c0)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-23 23:24:00 UTC  ``` The Kubelet has been found to be vulnerable to a denial of service attack via the kubelet API, including the unauthenticated HTTP read-only API typically served on port 10255, and the authenticated HTTPS API typically served on port 10250.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c1)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-23 23:24:29 UTC  ``` Created kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1816405](show_bug.cgi?id=1816405 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-8551 kubernetes: crafted requests to kubelet API allow for memory exhaustion [fedora-all]")]   Created origin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1816406](show_bug.cgi?id=1816406 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-8551 origin: kubernetes: crafted requests to kubelet API allow for memory exhaustion [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c8)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-24 05:55:23 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Prevent unauthenticated or unauthorized access to the Kubelet API   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c10)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-24 06:54:27 UTC  ``` Probably the reason kubelets before 1.15.0 are unaffected is the lack of this commit, which added kubelet http metrics:  <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/538cd87864ee18fa0ae31b20b39728ada6f2f9ba>  Comparing against a 4.x cluster, 3.11 clusters do not have 'kubelet_http*' metrics available:  OCP 4.3: $ curl -s -k <cert_creds> <https://localhost:10250/metrics> | grep kubelet_http # HELP kubelet_http_inflight_requests [ALPHA] Number of the inflight http requests # TYPE kubelet_http_inflight_requests gauge kubelet_http_inflight_requests{long_running="false",method="GET",path="",server_type="readwrite"} 0 kubelet_http_inflight_requests{long_running="false",method="GET",path="metrics",server_type="readwrite"} 1 ...  OCP 3.11: $ curl -s -k <cert_creds>  <https://localhost:10250/metrics> | grep -kubelet_http $  So I think it's safe to say OCP 3.11 is notaffected.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c12)  Ryan Phillips    2020-03-24 14:22:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1816378](show_bug.cgi?id=1816378 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Backport kubelet patch for metrics") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c13)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-25 07:55:35 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-security-announce/2UOlsba2g0s> <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/89377>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c15)  Sam Fowler    2020-03-30 04:13:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  By default, OpenShift Container Platform does not allow unauthenticated access to the Kubelet API. OpenShift Container Platform versions before 4.2 are not affected by this vulnerability as they are based on earlier versions of Kubernetes which do not include metrics for the Kubelet HTTP server.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-07 13:02:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3  Via RHSA-2020:1276 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1276](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1276)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c19)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-07 16:31:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-8551>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1816403#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-08 07:14:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3  Via RHSA-2020:1277 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1277](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1277)   ``` |  |
