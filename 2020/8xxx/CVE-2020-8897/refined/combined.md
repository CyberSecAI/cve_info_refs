> **November 1, 2021**: AWS KMS is replacing the term *customer master key* (CMK) with *AWS KMS key* and *KMS key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some variations of this term. [More info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms_keys).

---

I’m excited to announce the launch of two new features in the [AWS Encryption SDK (ESDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html): local KeyId filtering and key commitment. These features each enhance security for our customers, acting as additional layers of protection for your most critical data. In this post I’ll tell you how they work. Let’s dig in.

The ESDK is a client-side encryption library designed to make it easy for you to implement client-side encryption in your application using industry standards and best practices. Since the security of your encryption is only as strong as the security of your key management, the ESDK integrates with the [AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), though the ESDK doesn’t require you to use any particular source of keys. When using AWS KMS, the ESDK wraps data keys to one or more AWS KMS keys (KMS keys) stored in AWS KMS on encrypt, and calls AWS KMS again on decrypt to unwrap the keys.

It’s important to use only KMS keys you trust. If you encrypt to an untrusted KMS key, someone with access to the message and that KMS key could decrypt your message. It’s equally important to only use trusted KMS keys on decrypt! Decrypting with an untrusted KMS key could expose you to ciphertext substitution, where you could decrypt a message that was valid, but written by an untrusted actor. There are several controls you can use to prevent this. I recommend a belt-and-suspenders approach. (Technically, this post’s approach is more like a belt, suspenders, and an extra pair of pants.)

The first two controls aren’t new, but they’re important to consider. First, you should configure your application with an [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_id-based) that only allows it to use specific KMS keys. An IAM policy allowing Decrypt on “Resource”:”\*” might be appropriate for a development or testing account, but production accounts should list out KMS keys explicitly. Take a look at our [best practices for IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policies-best-practices) for use with AWS KMS for more detailed guidance. Using IAM policy to control access to specific KMS keys is a powerful control, because you can programmatically audit that the policy is being used across all of your accounts. To help with this, [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) has added [new rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-inline-policy-blocked-kms-actions.html) and [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/) added [new controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-controls.html#fsbp-kms-1) to detect existing IAM policies that might allow broader use of KMS keys than you intended. We recommend that you enable Security Hub’s Foundational Security Best Practices standard in all of your accounts and regions. This standard includes a set of vetted automated security checks that can help you assess your security posture across your AWS environment. To help you when writing new policies, the IAM policy visual editor in the AWS Management Console warns you if you are about to create a new policy that would add the “Resource”:”\*” condition in any policy.

The second control to consider is to make sure you’re passing the KeyId parameter to AWS KMS on [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) and [ReEncrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ReEncrypt.html) requests. KeyId is optional for symmetric KMS keys on these requests, since the ciphertext blob that the [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) request returns includes the KeyId as metadata embedded in the blob. That’s quite useful—it’s easier to use, and means you can’t (permanently) lose track of the KeyId without also losing the ciphertext. That’s an important concern for data that you need to access over long periods of time. Data stores that would otherwise include the ciphertext and KeyId as separate objects get re-architected over time and the mapping between the two objects might be lost. If you explicitly pass the KeyId in a decrypt operation, AWS KMS will only use that KeyId to decrypt, and you won’t be surprised by using an untrusted KMS key. As a best practice, pass KeyId whenever you know it. ESDK messages always include the KeyId; as part of this release, the ESDK will now always pass KeyId when making AWS KMS [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) requests.

A third control to protect you from using an unexpected KMS key is called local KeyId filtering. If you explicitly pass the KeyId of an untrusted KMS key, you would still be open to ciphertext substitution—so you need to be sure you’re only passing KeyIds that you trust. The ESDK will now filter KeyIds locally by using a list of trusted KMS keys or AWS account IDs you configure. This enforcement happens client-side, before calling AWS KMS. Let’s walk through a code sample. I’ll use Java here, but this feature is available in all of the supported languages of the ESDK.

Let’s say your app is decrypting ESDK messages read out of an [Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queue. Somewhere you’ll likely have a function like this:

```
public byte[] decryptMessage(final byte[] messageBytes,
                             final Map<String, String> encryptionContext) {
    // The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key.
    final String keyArn = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab";

    // 1. Instantiate the SDK
    AwsCrypto crypto = AwsCrypto.builder().build();

```

Now, when you create a KmsMasterKeyProvider, you’ll configure it with one or more KeyIds you expect to use. I’m passing a single element here for simplicity.

```
	// 2. Instantiate a KMS master key provider in Strict Mode using buildStrict()
    final KmsMasterKeyProvider keyProvider = KmsMasterKeyProvider.builder().buildStrict(keyArn);

```

Decrypt the message as normal. The ESDK will check each encrypted data key against the list of KeyIds configured at creation: in the preceeding example, the single KMS key in keyArn. The ESDK will only call AWS KMS for matching encrypted data keys; if none match, it will throw a CannotUnwrapDataKeyException.

```
	// 3. Decrypt the message.
    final CryptoResult<byte[], KmsMasterKey> decryptResult = crypto.decryptData(keyProvider, messageBytes);

    // 4. Validate the encryption context.
    //

```

(See [our documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/concepts.html#encryption-context) for more information on how encryption context provides additional authentication features!)

```
	checkEncryptionContext(decryptResult, encryptionContext);

    // 5. Return the decrypted bytes.
    return decryptResult.getResult();
}

```

We recommend that everyone using the ESDK with AWS KMS adopt local KeyId filtering. How you do this varies by language—the [ESDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html) provides detailed instructions and example code.

I’m especially excited to announce the second new feature of the ESDK, key commitment, which addresses a non-obvious property of modern symmetric ciphers used in the industry (including the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)). These ciphers have the property that decrypting a single ciphertext with two different keys could give different plaintexts! Picking a pair of keys that decrypt to two *specific* messages involves trying random keys until you get the message you want, making it too expensive for most messages. However, if you’re encrypting messages of a few bytes, it might be feasible. Most authenticated encryption schemes, such as AES-GCM, don’t solve for this issue. Instead, they prevent someone who doesn’t control the keys from tampering with the ciphertext. But someone who controls both keys can craft a ciphertext that will properly authenticate under each key by using AES-GCM.

All of this means that if a sender can get two parties to use different keys, those two parties could decrypt the exact same ciphertext and get different results. That could be problematic if the message reads, for example, as “sell 1000 shares” to one party, and “buy 1000 shares” to another.

The ESDK solves this problem for you with key commitment. Key commitment means that only a single data key can decrypt a given message, and that trying to use any other data key will result in a failed authentication check and a failure to decrypt. This property allows for senders and recipients of encrypted messages to know that everyone will see the same plaintext message after decryption. If you’re interested in the technical details and cryptographic analysis of the construction used for key commitment in the AWS Encryption SDK, we are using the construction detailed in [Shay Gueron, Key Committing AEADs, IACR ePrint 2020](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153).

Key commitment is on by default in version 2.0 of the ESDK. This is a breaking change from earlier versions. Existing customers should follow the [ESDK migration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/migration.html) for their language to upgrade from 1.x versions of the ESDK currently in their environment. I recommend a thoughtful and careful migration.

AWS is always looking for feedback on ways to improve our services and tools. Security-related concerns can be reported to AWS Security at aws-security@amazon.com. We’re deeply grateful for security research, and we’d like to thank Thai Duong from Google’s security team for reaching out to us. I’d also like to thank my colleagues on the AWS Crypto Tools team for their collaboration, dedication, and commitment (pun intended) to continuously improving our libraries.

## Package

AWS Encryption SDK
(Java, Python, C, Javascript)

## Affected versions

< 2.0.0

## Patched versions

2.0.0

## Description

Authors: Thai "[thaidn](https://twitter.com/xorninja)" Duong

# Summary

The following security vulnerabilities was discovered and reported to Amazon, affecting AWS KMS and all versions of [AWS Encryption SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html) prior to version 2.0.0:

* **Information leakage**: an attacker can create ciphertexts that would leak the user’s AWS account ID, encryption context, user agent, and IP address upon decryption
* **Ciphertext forgery**: an attacker can create ciphertexts that are accepted by other users
* **Robustness**: an attacker can create ciphertexts that decrypt to different plaintexts for different users

The first two bugs are somewhat surprising because they show that the ciphertext format can lead to vulnerabilities. These bugs (and the infamous [alg: "None"](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/) bugs in JWT) belong to a class of vulnerabilities called **in-band protocol negotiation**. This is the second time we’ve found in-band protocol negotiation vulnerabilities in AWS cryptography libraries; see this [bug](https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw) in S3 Crypto SDK discovered by my colleague Sophie Schmieg.

In JWT and S3 SDK the culprit is the algorithm field—here it is the key ID. Because the key ID is used to determine which decryption key to use, it can’t be meaningfully authenticated despite being under the attacker’s control. If the key ID is a URL indicating where to fetch the key, the attacker can replace it with their own URL, and learn side-channel information such as the timing and machines on which the decryption happens (this can also lead to [SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf) issues, but that’s another topic for another day).

In AWS, the key ID is a unique [Amazon Resource Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html). If an attacker were to capture a ciphertext from a user and replace its key ID with their own, the victim’s AWS account ID, encryption context, user agent, and IP address would be logged to the attacker’s AWS account whenever the victim attempted to decrypt the modified ciphertext.

The last bug shows that the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as [AES-GCM-SIV](https://keymaterial.net/2020/09/07/invisible-salamanders-in-aes-gcm-siv/) or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) is especially problematic in multi-recipient settings. These ciphers have a property that can cause nonidentical plaintexts when decrypting a single ciphertext with two different keys! For example, you can send a single encrypted email to Alice and Bob which, upon decryption, reads “attack” to Alice and “retreat” to Bob. The AWS Encryption SDKs are vulnerable to this attack because they allow a single ciphertext to be generated for multiple recipients, with each decrypting using a different key. I believe this kind of problem is prevalent. I briefly looked at [JWE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516) and I think it is vulnerable.

# Mitigations

Amazon has fixed these bugs in release 2.0.0 of the SDKs. A new major version was required because, unfortunately, the fix for the last bug requires a breaking change from earlier versions. All users are recommended to upgrade. More details about Amazon’s mitigations can be found in [their announcement](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/improved-client-side-encryption-explicit-keyids-and-key-commitment/).

We’re collaborating with Shay Gueron on a paper regarding fast committing AEADs.

# Vulnerabilities

## Information Leakage

The [Encrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html) API in AWS KMS encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The ciphertext format is undocumented, but it contains metadata that specifies the CMK and the encryption algorithm. I reverse-engineered the format and found the location of the CMK. Externally the CMK is identified by its key ARN, but within a ciphertext it is represented by an internal ID, which remained stable during my testing.

When I replaced the internal ID of a CMK in a ciphertext with the internal ID of another CMK, I found that AWS KMS attempted to decrypt the ciphertext with the new CMK. The encryption failed and the failure event—including the AWS Account ID, the user agent and the IP address of the caller—was logged to Cloud Trail in the account that owned the replacement CMK.

This enables the following attack:

* The attacker creates a CMK that has a key policy that allows access from everyone. This requires no prior knowledge about the victim.
* The attacker intercepts a ciphertext from the victim, and replaces its CMK with their CMK.
* Whenever the victim attempts to decrypt the modified ciphertext, the attacker learns the timing of such actions, the victim’s AWS Account ID, user agent, encryption context, and IP address.

This attack requires the victim to have an IAM policy that allows them to access the attacker’s CMK. I found that this practice was allowed by the AWS Visual Policy Editor, but I don’t know whether it is common.

The AWS Encryption SDKs also succumb to this attack. The SDKs implement envelope encryption: encrypting data with a data encryption key (DEK) and then wrapping the DEK with a CMK using the Encrypt API in AWS KMS. The wrapped DEK is stored as part of the final ciphertext (format is defined [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/message-format.html)). The attacker can mount this attack by replacing the CMK in the wrapped DEK with their own.

## Ciphertext Forgery

The [Decrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html) API in AWS KMS doesn’t require the caller to specify the CMK. This parameter is required only when the ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK. Otherwise, AWS KMS uses the metadata that it adds to the ciphertext blob to determine which CMK was used to encrypt the ciphertext.

This leads to the following attack:

* The attacker creates a CMK that has a key policy that allows access from everyone. This requires no prior knowledge about the victim.
* The attacker generates a ciphertext by calling the Encrypt API with their key.
* The attacker intercepts a ciphertext from the victim, and replaces it entirely with their ciphertext.
* The victim successfully decrypts the ciphertext, as if it was encrypted under their own key. The attacker also learns when this happened, the victim’s AWS Account ID, user agent, encryption context, and IP address.

Similar to the information leakage attack, this attack also requires the victim to have an IAM policy that allows them to access the attacker’s CMK.

The AWS Encryption SDKs also succumb to this attack. They don’t specify the CMK when they call the Decrypt API to unwrap the DEK.

## Robustness

The AWS Encryption SDKs allow a single ciphertext to be generated for multiple recipients, with each decrypting using a different key. To that end, it wraps the DEK multiple times, each under a different CMK. The wrapped DEKs can be combined to form a single ciphertext which can be sent to multiple recipients who can use their own credentials to decrypt it. It’s reasonable to expect that all recipients should decrypt the ciphertext to an identical plaintext. However, because of the use of AES-GMAC and AES-GCM, it’s possible to create a ciphertext that decrypts to two valid yet different plaintexts for two different users. In other words, the AWS Encryption SDKs are [not](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/440.pdf) [robust](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf).

The encryption of a message under two CMKs can be summarized as follows:

* A DEK is randomly generated, and two wrapped DEKs are produced by calling the Encrypt API using the two CMKs
* A per-message AES-GCM key (K) is derived using HKDF from the DEK, a randomly generated message ID, and a fixed algorithm ID.
* A header is formed from the wrapped DEKs, the encryption context, and other metadata. A header authentication tag is computed on the header using AES-GMAC with K and a zero IV.
* The message is encrypted using AES-GCM with K, a non-zero IV, and fixed associated additional data. This produces a message authentication tag.
* The ciphertext consists of the header, the header authentication tag, the encrypted message, and the message authentication tag.

(There’s also a self-signed digital signature that is irrelevant to this discussion).

In order to decrypt a ciphertext, the AWS Encryption SDKs loops over the list of wrapped DEKs and returns the first one that it can successfully unwrap. The attacker therefore can wrap a unique DEK for each recipient. Next, the attacker exploits the non-committing property of GMAC to produce two messages that have the same GMAC tag under two different keys. The attacker has to do this twice, one for the header authentication tag and one for the message authentication tag.

```
Given a data blob B of one 128-bit block B_1, a GMAC tag is computed as follows:

B_1 * H^2 + B_len * H + J

where H and J depends on the key and B_len depends on the length of B.

To find a message that can produce the same tag under two different keys, one
can add append to B a new block B_2 whose value can be deduced by solving
an algebraic equation. That is, we want to find B_2 such that:

B_1 * H^3 + B_2 * H^2 + B_len * H + J = B_1 * H’^3 + B_2 * H’^2 + B_len * H’ + J’

where H’ and J’ are the corresponding H and J of the other key.

B_2 is the only unknown value in this equation, thus it can be computed using
finite field arithmetics of GF(2^128):

B_2 = [B_1 * (H^3+H’^3) + B_len * (H + H’) + J + J’] * (H^2 + H’^2)^-1.

```

**Figure 2: How to find a message that has the same GMAC tag under two different keys.**

The overall attack works as follows:

* The attacker generates a random DEK, derives a per-message key K, and encrypts message M with it using AES in counter mode. This generates a ciphertext C.
* The attacker generates another random DEK’, derives a per-message key K’, and performs trial decryption of C until the decrypted message M’ has desirable properties. For example, if the attacker wants the first bit of M’ different from that of M, this process should only take a few attempts.
* The attacker finds a block C\* such that the GMAC of C’ = C || C\* under K and K’ are identical. Denote this tag C’\_tag.
* The attacker wraps DEK and DEK’ under two recipients’ CMK.
* The attacker forms a header H and adds a block H\* to the encryption context such that the new H’ has the same authentication tag H’\_tag under K and K’.
* The attacker output H’, H’\_tag, C’, C’\_tag.

This attack is similar to the one discovered in [Facebook Messenger](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf).
