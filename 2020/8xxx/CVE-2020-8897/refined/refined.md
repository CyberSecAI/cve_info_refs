Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8897:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from GitHub explicitly references **CVE-2020-8897** and describes vulnerabilities in the AWS Encryption SDK, which aligns with the vulnerability description for this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in two main areas:

*   **In-band protocol negotiation:** The AWS Encryption SDK and AWS KMS use the key ID embedded within the ciphertext to determine which key to use for decryption. This allows an attacker to modify the key ID and potentially gain information or cause decryption failures in the victim's environment.
*   **Non-committing property of AES-GCM:** The AWS Encryption SDK allows multiple recipients to decrypt a single ciphertext using different keys. Due to the properties of AES-GCM, it's possible for an attacker to craft a single ciphertext that decrypts to different valid plaintexts for different recipients, potentially leading to misinterpretations or manipulation of data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can create ciphertexts that, when decrypted by a victim, leak the victim's AWS account ID, user agent, IP address, and encryption context to the attacker's AWS account.
*   **Ciphertext Forgery:** An attacker can create a valid ciphertext under their own key and substitute it for a victim's ciphertext. The victim will then successfully decrypt the forged ciphertext (assuming the attacker's key is accessible to the victim), potentially leading to the acceptance of untrusted data.
*   **Lack of Robustness:** Due to the non-committing nature of AES-GCM, an attacker can craft a single ciphertext that decrypts to different plaintexts under different keys. This vulnerability could be exploited in multi-recipient scenarios where an attacker could make different recipients see different information when decrypting the same data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain sensitive information about the victim, like their AWS account ID, user agent, IP address, and potentially even parts of the encryption context.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can forge ciphertexts, potentially leading to victims processing data that appears valid but originates from an untrusted source.
*  **Message Malleability:** In a multi-recipient scenario, an attacker can create a single encrypted message that is decrypted into different plaintext by different recipients.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Ciphertext Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts a legitimate ciphertext and modifies parts of it, such as the key ID, to point to their controlled resources (in the information leakage and ciphertext forgery cases), or craft ciphertexts specifically designed for the robustness issue.
*   **AWS KMS API:** The attacks leverage the AWS KMS Encrypt and Decrypt APIs to perform the attacks, especially how they don't require the explicit CMK ID on decrypt (for symmetric keys).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to intercept ciphertexts:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept ciphertexts exchanged between two parties. This might require a man-in-the-middle position in the network or access to the storage medium where the ciphertexts are stored.
*   **AWS Account:** The attacker needs an AWS account to create their own KMS keys for the information leakage and ciphertext forgery attacks. The attacker needs to have their own key policy allow access to everyone.
*   **Understanding of the AWS KMS ciphertext format:** The attacker needs to be able to reverse-engineer the ciphertext format used by AWS KMS and the AWS Encryption SDK in order to modify key IDs or craft specific ciphertexts.

**7. Additional Details:**

    *   Specific code examples in Java to describe how local KeyId filtering is implemented.
    *   A detailed description of how the ciphertext format is exploited in the information leakage attack.
    *   A description on how to craft the ciphertexts for the robustness issue leveraging the non-committing property of GMAC and how to compute B2 to achieve the same GMAC tag for two keys.
    *   An explanation of why a new major version of the SDK was required.
