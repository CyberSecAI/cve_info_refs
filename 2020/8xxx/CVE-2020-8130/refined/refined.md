  "CVE-2020-8130": {
    "description": "There is an OS command injection vulnerability in Rake (a ruby make-like utility) < 12.3.3 in Rake::FileList when supplying a filename that begins with the pipe character `|`.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an improper handling of filenames starting with a pipe character ('|') in Rake::FileList, leading to command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "OS command injection",
         "Insufficient input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary OS command execution.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Supply a crafted filename starting with '|' to Rake::FileList"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted filename to a vulnerable version of Rake.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Rake::FileList in Rake versions < 12.3.3"
       ],
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the file list processing in rake encounters a filename that starts with a pipe character. Due to the lack of proper sanitization, the pipe character is interpreted as a command separator by the system shell, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands.",
        "remediation": "Upgrade Rake to version 12.3.3 or later."
