{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-8595",
  "description": "A flaw was found in Istio in all versions released after 1.3 (included). The flaw is in Istio's Authentication Policy exact path matching logic and can allow unauthorized access to a HTTP path, even if the path is configured to be only accessed with a valid JWT token.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Istio JWT filter's exact path matching logic includes query strings or fragments instead of stripping them before matching.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Handling",
      "Authentication Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass JWT validation and gain unauthorized access to resources by appending `?` or `#` characters after the protected paths.",
     "attack_vector": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable Istio service.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not require any authentication, just the ability to send HTTP requests.",
    "position": "The attacker can be remote."
