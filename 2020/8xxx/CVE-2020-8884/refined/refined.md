Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper deserialization over named pipes in the `rcdsvc` endpoint service of the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Windows Agent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The core issue is the insecure deserialization of data received through named pipes. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data that can be deserialized and executed by the service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Windows SYSTEM user. This level of access grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed remotely over named pipes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system where the vulnerable agent is running. This implies the attacker would likely need to have already compromised an account on the system.

**Affected Versions:**
*   All versions between 6.3 and 7.8.2 of the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Windows Agent are affected.
*   Versions 7.4.2, 7.5.3, 7.6.4, 7.7.4, 7.8.3, and 7.9 contain the fix.
*   Mac and Linux agents are not affected.
