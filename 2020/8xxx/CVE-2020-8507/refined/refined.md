Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Citytv Video Android & iOS applications were sending potentially sensitive user data unencrypted to third-party analytics services (Adobe Experience Cloud, ScorecardResearch).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unencrypted Communication:** The applications transmit user data over insecure channels, lacking encryption. This exposes the data to eavesdropping.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information is sent to third parties without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker intercepting network traffic can capture sensitive information. This data includes:
    - Device model and resolution
    - Mobile carrier
    - Days since first use
    - Days since last use
    - Total number of app launches
    - Number of app launches since upgrade
    - Previous app session length
- **Privacy Violation:** User data is exposed without their knowledge, violating their privacy.
- **Tracking:** The collected data can be used to track user behavior and potentially target specific users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** Attackers positioned on the network path between the application and the third-party servers can intercept the unencrypted data traffic. This can be achieved on unsecured Wi-Fi networks or compromised network infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Monitoring:** The attacker needs the ability to monitor network traffic between the user's device and the third-party analytics servers.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic. This could be on the same network as the user (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or on the path between the user's device and the remote server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require any specific user authentication or access to the user's device itself.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in Citytv Video Android version 4.08.0 and below, and iOS version 3.36 and below.
- The issue was reported to Apple, Adobe PSIRT, and Citytv through various channels in 2019.
- The applications were still affected as of February 4, 2020.
