The content is related to CVE-2020-8434.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Jenzabar Internet Campus Solution (JICS) software has a vestigial session persistence mechanism that uses a cookie named `JICSLoginCookie`. This cookie's encrypted value is tied to a username for session authentication. The vulnerability arises because the username encryption function uses a hard-coded, non-unique encryption key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded encryption key: The primary vulnerability is the use of a static, non-unique encryption key within the username encryption function.
- Improper session handling: The software checks for the `JICSLoginCookie` cookie and prioritizes it over the standard ASP.NET session cookie for authentication, allowing the bypass of normal login procedures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and log in as any user simply by knowing their username.
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any account within the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted cookie: An attacker can craft a valid `JICSLoginCookie` for any username by using the known hard-coded encryption key, base64 encoding the output, and setting the cookie value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Knowledge of the hard-coded encryption key.
- Ability to craft and set cookies in the user's browser or through an HTTP request.
- Knowledge of the valid username within the target application.
