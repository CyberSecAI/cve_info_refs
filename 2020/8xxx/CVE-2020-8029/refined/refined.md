{
  "Root cause": "The skuba tool initially uploads the kubelet private key with world-readable permissions (0644) before setting the correct secure permissions (0400).",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insecure file handling",
    "Incorrect file permissions"
  ],
  "Impact": "A local non-root user on the node can read the kubelet private key during the brief period when it has world-readable permissions. This could allow unauthorized access or compromise of the kubelet service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local non-root user on a node being joined to a Kubernetes cluster.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute commands on the affected node as a non-root user."
