Should the `https://` be part of the `encodeURIComponent` call as well?

i'm pretty sure "shop" always comes back as foo.myshopify.com

a couple years ago, [@ragalie](https://github.com/ragalie) did this

[3284be1#diff-a15b7c0928331371cc40785dd637c644R16](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/commit/3284be1e6cfe9165a2b23339d7f1bf8367ee9df7#diff-a15b7c0928331371cc40785dd637c644R16)

which is a different way of fixing this, in a different place

| In general, I have a feeling that this PR is wrong.  The `shop` parameter should be checked as soon as it's received from the user, not every single time it's used. |

| FYI [@nhusher](https://github.com/nhusher) [@seamusabshere](https://github.com/seamusabshere) we have a bug bounty program over at <https://hackerone.com/shopify> 💰 and there are rules for participation!  I am thinking of two rules in particular:   * Rules for reporting must be followed. * Do not disclose any issues publicly before they have been resolved. |
