The provided content is related to CVE-2020-8176.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `shop` parameter in the `/auth/enable_cookies` endpoint. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `shop` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. The application was directly embedding the user-supplied `shop` parameter into a JavaScript context without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `shop` parameter was being used to set `window.shopOrigin`, which was then executed within the browser context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could potentially lead to:
    - Data theft (e.g., session cookies, personal information)
    - Account hijacking
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing the vulnerable endpoint (`/auth/enable_cookies`) with a crafted `shop` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code. The attacker would then trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL. This could be done through phishing emails, malicious advertisements, or other social engineering techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL containing the vulnerable endpoint and the malicious payload in the `shop` parameter. The attacker then needs to convince the victim to visit this crafted URL. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server.
