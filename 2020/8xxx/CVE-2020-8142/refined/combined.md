# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2020-002

* Advisory ID: REVIVE-SA-2020-002
* CVE-IDs: CVE-2020-8142, CVE-2020-8143
* Date: 2020-03-12
* Risk Level: Low
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 5.0.4
* Versions not affected: >= 5.0.5
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 – Security restriction bypass

* Vulnerability Type: Incorrect Authorization [CWE-863]
* CVE-IDs: [CVE-2020-8142](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8142)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector: AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 5.6
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 5.2
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 0.4

### Description

A security restriction bypass vulnerability has been discovered by HackerOne user hoangn144. Revive Adserver, like many other applications, requires the logged in user to type the current password in order to change the e-mail address or the password. It was however possible for anyone with access to a Revive Adserver admin user interface to bypass such check and change e-email address or password of the currently logged in user by altering the form payload.

### Details

The attack requires physical access to the user interface of a logged in user. If the POST payload was altered by turning the “pwold” parameter into an array, Revive Adserver would fetch and authorise the operation even if no password was provided.

### Description

An Open Redirect vulnerability was discovered and reported by HackerOne user hoangn144. A remote attacker could trick logged-in users to open a specifically crafted link and have them redirected to any destination.

### Details

The CSRF protection of the “/www/admin/\*-modify.php” could be skipped if no meaningful parameter was sent. No action was performed, but the user was still redirected to the target page, specified via the “returnurl” GET parameter.
