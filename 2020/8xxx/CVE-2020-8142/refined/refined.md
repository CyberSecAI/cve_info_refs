Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authorization checks when changing a user's email address or password. The application fails to properly validate the old password, allowing the bypass of the password check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization (CWE-863):** The application does not properly verify the user's old password before allowing changes to their email or password. By manipulating the form data, the old password check can be bypassed. Specifically, submitting "pwold" as an array instead of a string would cause the check to fail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to the user interface of a logged-in user can change the email address or password of that user without knowing the existing password.
- This allows an attacker to take over the account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the user interface of a logged-in user's session is required.
- The attacker needs to alter the POST payload of the change password/email form, specifically changing the `pwold` parameter to an array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have physical access to a computer that is logged into Revive Adserver.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability in order to change the form payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory indicates this is a low-risk vulnerability because it requires physical access to an already authenticated session.
- The vulnerability was resolved in version 5.0.5 of Revive Adserver.
