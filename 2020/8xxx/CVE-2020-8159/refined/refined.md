- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `actionpack_page-caching` Ruby gem, a static page caching module for Rails, allows writing arbitrary files due to insufficient sanitization of file paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file write vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could write arbitrary files to the web server. If the attacker is able to write unescaped ERB (Embedded Ruby) to a view, it could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious file path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file path used by the page caching module, likely through user-controlled input or other means of controlling the file system location. They need to be able to write unescaped ERB content for the RCE to be realized.
