{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The PASV mode handler in BearFTP did not check for default port connection, and also had improper handling of non-active users.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of non-active users in PASV mode",
      "Lack of default port connection check in PASV mode handler"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overwhelming the server with connections. An attacker could open a large number of connections on the PASV port, leading to excessive resource consumption (VIRT/RES increase) and the server becoming unresponsive.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending multiple connection requests to the PASV port and not sending any further commands, thus keeping the connection alive indefinitely.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP connections to the FTP server's PASV port."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "Patch_Details": "The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check for default port connections in the PASV mode handler and implementing a timeout mechanism for passive mode connections, which automatically disconnects inactive clients after 120 seconds.",
      "PoC": "A proof-of-concept (PoC) script was created that spawns a large number of threads that connect to the PASV port and do not send any commands, thus triggering the vulnerability. Before the patch, this would cause the server to spawn a large number of threads and consume excessive resources. After the patch, the server limits the connections and does not suffer the DoS impact."
