Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) race condition exists in Apport's crash report creation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The vulnerability lies between the `os.open()` call (which creates the crash report file) and the `os.chown()` call (which changes the file's owner).
*   **TOCTTOU:** During the race condition, the attacker can manipulate the file system, which can cause the `os.chown()` to operate on a file or symlink not originally intended.
*   The Apport cron script removes crash report files with a size of 0, allowing for a window of opportunity to replace the file before the `chown()` happens.
*   The cron script checks for zero-sized files. This combined with the race condition allows an attacker to replace the 0-sized file with a symlink/file.
*   Apport drops privileges, but the initial file creation is done with root effective UID and GID, opening a window to race against the cron job.
*   Apport reads user settings from `~/.config/apport/settings` which can be manipulated by the attacker to stop Apport at a critical time in file creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation (Limited):** A local attacker can exploit the race condition to change the ownership of arbitrary files to the crashing process's user, but only if the `fs.protected_symlinks` is disabled, which isn't the default.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The race condition allows a local attacker to potentially read arbitrary files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Crash Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger a crash report generation process using Apport.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to manipulate the file system to create symlinks and block Apport temporarily using a FIFO to exploit the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute code.
*   They require the ability to send signals to the Apport process.
*   They need to manipulate files in `/var/crash`, which is world writable, but sticky.
*   The attacker can manipulate the settings file in the user's home directory (`~/.config/apport/settings`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by a combination of factors: the TOCTTOU race, the Apport cron script's cleanup behavior and the ability to manipulate user settings.
*   The fix involves using a file descriptor (obtained with `reportfile.fileno()`) instead of the file path when calling `chown()`, and adding `follow_symlinks=False`. This prevents the symlink attack by operating directly on the opened file, not through its potentially changing name.
*   The original report suggested removing the size 0 condition in the cron script, but it wasn't fixed by the patch.

In summary, CVE-2020-8833 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Apport due to a TOCTTOU race condition during crash report creation, where an attacker can manipulate the file system and cause `chown()` to affect unintended files or symlinks. This is partially mitigated by the default setting of `fs.protected_symlinks`.
