Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, or DoS.  An attacker needs to compromise a node, intercept certain requests to the Kubelet, and respond with a malicious redirect using the original credentials. If multiple clusters share the same certificate authority trusted by the client, and the same authentication credentials, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to redirect the client to another cluster.",
    "remediation": "Upgrade the kube-apiserver to a patched version. Fixed versions include: kube-apiserver v1.18.6, v1.17.9 and v1.16.13. Proxied backends that respond to upgrade requests with a non-101 response code may be broken by the patch.
