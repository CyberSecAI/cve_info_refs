Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8184:

**CVE-2020-8184**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation or integrity checks on cookies within the Rack framework. Specifically, the issue arises because Rack does not prevent an attacker from forging secure or host-only cookie prefixes by using URL encoding (percent encoding) on the cookie name.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Cookie Prefix Forgery**: An attacker can craft a cookie with a percent-encoded name that, when decoded, results in a secure or host-only prefix (e.g., `__Host-` or `__Secure-`). This allows the attacker to bypass the security mechanisms that rely on these prefixes to determine if a cookie is safe to process.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation**: The core issue is that the application doesn't validate if a cookie's prefix is legitimate before processing the cookie, which makes it vulnerable.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Insecure Cookie Processing**: A vulnerable application could be tricked into processing an insecure (non-SSL) or cross-origin request.
    *   **Cross-Origin Request Manipulation**: Attackers may manipulate an application into processing a cross-origin request that it should not normally allow, which could lead to information disclosure or other security breaches.
    *   **Bypassing Security Mechanisms**: By forging cookie prefixes, attackers bypass mechanisms that ensure secure cookie handling.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Arbitrary Cookie Write:**  The attacker needs the ability to write arbitrary cookies to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved in several ways depending on the application:
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker can inject JavaScript code to set malicious cookies.
        *   **Other vulnerabilities:** Any other vulnerability that allows to set the cookies from attacker-controlled data.
        *   **Man-in-the-middle (MitM):** In certain scenarios, an attacker performing a MitM attack could inject cookies into the request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Ability to Write Cookies**: The attacker must have the ability to write cookies that are sent to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through exploiting another vulnerability, such as XSS.
    *   **Network Access:** Typically, the attacker would need to have network access to communicate with the vulnerable application, either directly or indirectly.

**Summary of Technical Details**

The core of the vulnerability lies in how Rack handles cookie parsing. It does not properly sanitize or validate the cookie names when parsing the `Cookie` header.  By using percent-encoding in the cookie name, an attacker can insert characters that, after being decoded, form the desired prefixes (`__Host-` or `__Secure-`), thereby deceiving the application into treating them as legitimate secure cookies.

The fix involves ensuring that cookie names are properly sanitized and that the prefixes cannot be forged through URL encoding. The provided patches only decode the cookie values and not the cookie names.
