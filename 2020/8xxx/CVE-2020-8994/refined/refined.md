  "CVE-2020-8994": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered on XIAOMI AI speaker MDZ-25-DT 1.34.36, 1.40.14.Attackers can get root shell by accessing the UART interface and then they can read Wi-Fi SSID or password, read the dialogue text files between users and XIAOMI AI speaker, use Text-To-Speech tools pretend XIAOMI speakers' voice achieve social engineering attacks, eavesdrop on users and record what XIAOMI AI speaker hears, delete the entire XIAOMI AI speaker system, modify system files, stop voice assistant service, start the XIAOMI AI speakerâ€™s SSH service as a backdoor.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of authentication for access to the UART ports on the XIAOMI AI speaker MDZ-25-DT devices, which allows an attacker to gain root shell access without needing a password.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of authentication on UART interface"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain root shell access, enabling them to perform various malicious activities including reading sensitive information (Wi-Fi credentials, conversation logs), impersonating the device, eavesdropping, and modifying or deleting the system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Physical access to the UART interface of the device"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires physical access to the XIAOMI AI speaker MDZ-25-DT device to connect to the UART port."
