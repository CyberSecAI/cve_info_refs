MySQL versions through 5.6.49, 5.7.31, 7.3.30, 7.4.29, 7.5.19, 7.6.15, and 8.0.21 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server.\" This indicates a vulnerability in the MySQL server itself, likely related to improper handling of data or requests.",

        "The text mentions \"Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in NodeJS.\" However, the description mentions it related to the MySQL server side, it could be some issue in NodeJS code processing requests for the MySQL server."
