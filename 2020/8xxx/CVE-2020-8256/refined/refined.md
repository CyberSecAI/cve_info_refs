The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Pulse Connect Secure, including CVE-2020-8256.

**CVE-2020-8256 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The Pulse Secure VPN appliance allows administrators to upload custom templates in XML format for teleconference bridge profiles. The XML parser used by the appliance is vulnerable to XXE injection, due to not sanitizing the input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the appliance's filesystem.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must be an authenticated user.
    *   The attacker uploads a specially crafted malicious XML template file to the teleconference bridge profile template section.
    *   The attacker triggers the parsing of the malicious XML, which causes the server to read the specified files from the filesystem and return the content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin dashboard in order to upload XML templates.

**Additional Information:**

The blog post details other vulnerabilities found in the Pulse Connect Secure software, including:
*   **CVE-2020-8238:** XSS vulnerability in `launch.cgi`, which allows an attacker to steal session cookies by tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted link.
*   **CVE-2020-8218:** RCE vulnerability via command injection in the `downloadlicenses.cgi` file. This vulnerability requires authentication.
*   XSS via command injection in `downloadlicenses.cgi`, which also allows an attacker to steal the session cookie of an admin.

The blog post also details how the researchers extracted the source code of the Pulse Secure appliance by manipulating the virtual machine's memory during boot to gain a root shell, allowing for further analysis of the appliance's software.
