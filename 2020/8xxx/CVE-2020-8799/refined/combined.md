Ne fonctionne pas, impossible d’ajouter le shortcode, la configuration n’est pas pris en compte sur le modèle.

Хороший плагин. Просто настраивается, сайт не тормозит.

Excellent support.
I had an issue, send a mail to techsupport and I received a working solution a few hours later.

Our website uses this plugin extensively to gather user reviews on our videos at Oasis Videos®. The plugin works seamlessly on our site! We have upgraded to the PRO Version to access the additional features and flexibility that WTI Like Post offers and we have no regret whatsoever. For such an affordable plugin the features are beyond compare and allow our visitors to register their like/dislike for our content in such an easy manner. Above all, thanks to the support team for helping our developers setting up some custom features. We fully recommend this plugin and the awesome support that WTI Like Post offers. Thanks, guys!

While it may not have all the features that the more expensive plugins have, it gets the job done if you’re just looking for an upvote and downvote system. You could probably easily extend it further if you wanted by looking at the code.
They have pretty excellent support, and they helped me out within hours of asking them a question.
