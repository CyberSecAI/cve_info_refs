# CVE-2020-8088 ‚Äì UseBB Forum 1.0.12 ‚Äì PHP Type Juggling vulnerability

Posted on [January 22, 2020](https://xavibel.com/2020/01/22/usebb-forum-php-type-juggling-vulnerability/ "6:55 pm") by [Xavi](https://xavibel.com/author/xavi/ "View all posts by Xavi")

Hello!

Last week I was reading about PHP Type Juggling vulnerabilities and I decided to spend a couple of days learning about them.

These vulnerabilities can happen during comparison of PHP variables, because PHP will automatically convert the data into a common comparable type.

My idea was to try to find one by my own. But first I needed to look for some PHP open source code to review.

I thought that I could find one in old open source forums. My idea was to try to understand the authentication and the password recovery implementations.

After installing a couple of different open source forums I‚Äôve found UseBB software that seemed to have an interesting implementation of the login.

## Installing the software and creating and admin user

So I installed the software, to do that I created a database and followed the installation steps.

I created an admin user with the following credentials:

```
username=admin
password=aabC9RqS
```
## Checking the login implementation

Doing a quick code check, I‚Äôve found that the login was implemented in the file: ‚Äú/sources/panel\_login.php‚Äù

[![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/code-review-1024x768.png)](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/code-review-1024x768.png)

UseBB Forum Login implementation

## Identifying a vulnerability

The application does different checks to verify if the password supplied by the user is correct. The most important line for checking the Type Juggling vulnerability is the following:

if ( !$userdata[‚Äòid‚Äô] || **md5**(stripslashes($\_POST[‚Äòpasswd‚Äô])) **!=** $userdata[‚Äòpasswd‚Äô] ) {

Notice that it‚Äôs using only one equal sign, that is a loose comparison, and they should have used an strict one.

In this link you can read the following:

<https://www.whitehatsec.com/blog/magic-hashes/>

‚Äú*For more than the last decade, PHP programmers have been wrestling with the equals-equals (==) operator. It‚Äôs caused a lot of issues. This has a particular implication for password hashes. Password hashes in PHP are base16 encoded and can come in the form of ‚Äú0e812389‚Ä¶‚Äù. The problem is in == comparison the 0e means that if the following characters are all digits the whole string gets treated as a float.* ‚Äú

What they are talking about, is that when there is a loose comparison, you can do strange things, like this:

```
socket@lab:~$ php -r "print md5('aabC9RqS');";echo ''
0e041022518165728065344349536299
socket@lab:~$ php -r "print md5('aabg7XSs');";echo ''
0e087386482136013740957780965295
socket@lab:~$ php -r "var_dump(md5('aabC9RqS') == md5('aabg7XSs'));"
bool(true)
```

As you can see the hashes are different but when we compare them with a loose comparison the result is true.

## Login with the same user using a different password

Before doing anything, let‚Äôs check the current status of our database. Specifically the table usebb\_members that stores usernames and hashed passwords.

I see the following hash stored as the password:

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/password-hash-2.png)

UseBB Forum admin password hash

If we remember the login verification, this hash is the value for the variable: $userdata[‚Äòpasswd‚Äô]

Doing a quick verification we can see that this hash, is the md5 value of the password that we used when we registered the user:

```
socket@lab:~$ php -r "print md5('aabC9RqS');";echo ''
0e041022518165728065344349536299
```

We know that the password for the user admin is: ‚ÄúaabC9RqS‚Äù but let‚Äôs try to use ‚Äúaabg7XSs‚Äù instead.

We try to login using this password:

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/login-with-different-password.png)

The server is evaluating this:

```
md5('aabC9RqS') == md5('aabg7XSs')
0e041022518165728065344349536299 == 0e087386482136013740957780965295
```

And as we saw before‚Ä¶

```
php -r "var_dump(md5('aabC9RqS') == md5('aabg7XSs'));"
bool(true)
```

So, we are in üôÇ

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/admin-login.png)
## Vulnerability solution:

We need to add an extra equal in the line 72 of sources/panel\_login.php

if ( !$userdata[‚Äòid‚Äô] || md5(stripslashes($\_POST[‚Äòpasswd‚Äô])) **!==** $userdata[‚Äòpasswd‚Äô] ) {

This software seems to doesn‚Äôt have support. But if you are using it, I recommend you to migrate it to Drupal using this plugin:

<https://www.drupal.org/project/usebb2drupal>

## Interesting resources:

# CVE-2020-10963 ‚Äì Unrestricted File Upload in FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator

Posted on [March 23, 2020](https://xavibel.com/2020/03/23/unrestricted-file-upload-in-frozennode-laravel-administrator/ "10:53 pm") by [Victor](https://xavibel.com/author/victor/ "View all posts by Victor")

Hi all,

This time, we want to show you how we achieved unrestricted file upload in the Laravel-Administrator package of FrozenNode. This open source software,¬†is an administrative interface builder for¬†[Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

<https://github.com/FrozenNode/Laravel-Administrator>

As Laravel-Administrator allows you to create your own modules, we enabled the file upload in one of them:

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1-1024x278.png)

If we try to upload a php file, it raises an error regarding wrong file extension

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2-300x89.png)

This protection can be easily bypassed following the steps below:

* Uploading an allowed file
* Capture the request with BurpSuite (or any other proxy)
* Replace filename extension by .php
* Add a GIF Image header in order to bypass file content filters
* Write the PHP code that you want to execute in the server

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.png)

At this point, we have been able to upload our payload into the server and, in addition, the server provided us the path of the uploaded file.

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4.png)You will have noticed that the filename has been replaced by a random string but, as far as it is giving us the name, is easy to find.

![](https://xavibel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5.png)

At this point, we have remote code execution in the server.

As this project is officially abandoned and its fork ([Laravel-Admin](https://github.com/exodusanto/Laravel-Admin)) seems to have stopped the development since Laravel 5.8, we encourage the users to migrate to other supported platforms.

# Siemens Polarion ‚Äì CVE-2019-13934, CVE-2019-13935, CVE-2019-13936

Posted on [November 25, 2019](https://xavibel.com/2019/11/25/siemens-polarion-multiple-web-vulnerabilities/ "2:29 pm") by [Xavi](https://xavibel.com/author/xavi/ "View all posts by Xavi")

Hello,

I write this blog post for people that is just starting in web application hacking. I recommend you that you just download some product or web application and start testing it.

You are going to realize that sometimes is quite simple to find some interesting vulnerabilities, and it‚Äôs also a good experience to report them to the product owner and help to make things a little bit more secure üôÇ

---

About 6 months ago I spent a couple of hours playing with a Siemens product named Polarion.

After a manual revision of some requests I discovered some web vulnerabilities and I reported them to their product CERT.

As the final step of the responsible disclosure, they explained me that to assign the CVE numbers, I should publish my findings.

That is the reason why I‚Äôm writing this blog post. So here I share with you the details:

---

## CVE-2019-13934 ‚Äì Siemens Subversion ‚Äì Reflected Cross Site Scripting

**Affected version:** Polarion Subversion webclient 1.7.14

**Product information:** https://polarion.plm.automation.siemens.com/products/svn/svn\_webclient

**Vulnerability details:** The vulnerability it‚Äôs located in the parameter¬†**filename**¬†inside the following POST request:

```
POST /polarion/svnwebclient/fileUpdateAction.jsp?url=file.txt HTTP/1.1

```

And here you can see the response from the server:

```

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                File file.txt<img src=a onerror=alert('XSS-Validation')> was successfully committed.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding-top:10px;">
                <b>Changed elements:</b>
...
```

Here are some evidences:

I hope in a couple of weeks I can write a more interesting post related with a vulnerability named PHP Type Juggling.

See you soon!
