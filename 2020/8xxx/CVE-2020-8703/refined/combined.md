WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• As a prerequisite for an attack, an attacker must be able to run untrusted code on affected systems.

Siemens recommends limiting the possibilities to run untrusted code if possible.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC Field PG is a mobile, industry-standard programming device for automation engineers with all
commonly used interfaces for industrial applications that also brings pre-installed SIMATIC engineering
software.

SIMATIC IPC (Industrial PC) is the hardware platform for PC-based automation from Siemens.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility
to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in
C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel
to the STEP 7 program if required.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop floor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SINUMERIK MC is a CNC system for customized machine solutions.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automa-
tion.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.
