Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "Improper buffer restrictions" within a subsystem of the Intel Converged Security and Manageability Engine (CSME). This indicates a flaw in how the subsystem manages memory buffers, allowing for potential out-of-bounds access or manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Buffer Restrictions:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking or size validation when handling buffers within the CSME subsystem. This can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher levels of access or control over the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although listed with CVSS score as a low impact, data could be read from memory locations that should not be accessible, potentially leaking sensitive information.
*   **Modification of Data:** An attacker could overwrite memory locations, leading to manipulation of system functionality or persistent compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the affected system. This typically means the attacker needs to have some form of user access on the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged User:** The attacker must have a privileged user account on the target machine, or elevate themselves to this level first.
*   **Local Access:** Physical or remote access to the vulnerable device, assuming the remote access method grants the necessary level of control.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   The vulnerability affects various Intel CSME versions before the following:
    *   11.8.86
    *   11.12.86
    *   11.22.86
    *   12.0.81
    *   13.0.47
    *   13.30.17
    *   14.1.53
    *   14.5.32
    *    15.0.22
*   Multiple specific Intel chipsets and processors are listed as vulnerable. See the Intel advisory for specific processor and chipset models.
*   Specific Siemens products using the vulnerable Intel chipsets/processors are also listed as affected, including SIMATIC Field PG M5/M6, various SIMATIC IPC models, and SINUMERIK systems.
*   NetApp lists "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)" as vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Intel advisory (INTEL-SA-00459) provides the primary details regarding this vulnerability, including the specific affected versions of Intel CSME.
*   Siemens provides specific BIOS updates to mitigate the issue for their affected products.
*   NetApp confirms this vulnerability affects their "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)" product and will not be patched, with end of availability (EOA) announced.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 5.1 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N, showing that the vulnerability requires local access (AV:L), low complexity (AC:L), privileged user access (PR:H), no user interaction (UI:N), and has an impact of low confidentiality (C:L), high integrity (I:H) and no availability impact (A:N).
*   Siemens lists the vulnerability with a CWE of CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, which seems incorrect because the vulnerability is related to improper buffer restrictions, which may or may not include encryption issues.

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how different vendors are addressing it.
