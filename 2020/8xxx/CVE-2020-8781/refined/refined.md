The provided content is a security bulletin from Sierra Wireless (SWI-PSA-2020-005) detailing a vulnerability related to ALEOS. Although the bulletin refers to "ALEOS Local Privilege Escalation and LAN-Side RPC Server Remote Code Execution," it doesn't directly specify the CVE ID of CVE-2020-8781. However, given the bulletin number, it is highly likely this bulletin is describing this CVE or related vulnerabilities. Thus, we will extract the information from this bulletin with the understanding that it might be related to the CVE in question.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The bulletin mentions two distinct vulnerabilities, though not specifically the root causes in detail:
1. A local privilege escalation vulnerability within ALEOS.
2. A LAN-side RPC server remote code execution vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. Local Privilege Escalation:  An issue allowing a local user to gain elevated privileges within the ALEOS system.
2. Remote Code Execution (RCE): An issue in the RPC server allowing an attacker on the LAN to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. Local Privilege Escalation:  An attacker with limited access to the system could escalate their privileges, gaining full control of the system.
2. Remote Code Execution: A remote attacker on the same LAN could completely compromise the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
1. Local Privilege Escalation: Requires local access to the device running ALEOS.
2. Remote Code Execution: Attacker must be on the same LAN as the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. Local Privilege Escalation: Requires a local user account with some privileges.
2. Remote Code Execution: Requires network access to the LAN on which the affected device is present.

The bulletin notes that these vulnerabilities apply to "all versions" of ALEOS running on a number of AirLink products, including LX40, LX60, MP70, MP70E, RV50, RV50X, RV55, ES450, GX450, ES440, GX400, GX440, and LS300.
