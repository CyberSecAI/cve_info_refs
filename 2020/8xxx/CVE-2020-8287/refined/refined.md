  "CVE-2020-8287": {
    "description": "The provided data indicates a HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability in Node.js due to two copies of a header field in an HTTP request. When two copies of a header field like 'Transfer-Encoding' are present, Node.js identifies and uses the first, ignoring the second. This can lead to request smuggling.",
    "affected_component": "Node.js",
     "vulnerability": "HTTP Request Smuggling",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of duplicate header fields in HTTP requests, where the first header is processed, and subsequent ones are ignored.",
    "impact": "Allows an attacker to potentially smuggle HTTP requests, leading to various malicious activities like bypassing security controls, cache poisoning, or hijacking user sessions.",
    "attack_vector": "Network-based attacks using crafted HTTP requests with duplicate header fields.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a Node.js application or server.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Node.js.",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited in all versions of the 15.x, 14.x, 12.x and 10.x releases lines of Node.js.",
        "Fixes involve backporting security fixes rather than upgrading to a new upstream version to minimize disruptions.",
        "Debian has addressed the vulnerability by releasing version 10.23.1~dfsg-1~deb10u1 in its stable distribution (buster).",
        "Fedora has addressed the vulnerability by releasing nodejs-12.20.1-1.fc32, nodejs-14.15.4-1.fc33.",
