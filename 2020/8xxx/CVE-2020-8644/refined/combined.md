Hi,

You can upgrade from 1.4.2 by replacing all files with new one, and then insert upgrade from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 db file.

Replace all php and html files, and also don’t forget to replace playsmsd.php. Do not insert wrong upgrade db file. Make backup when possible.

Pretty much like this article, only its from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3 (and of course use your actual path):

<https://help.playsms.org/en/installation/upgrades/upgrade_from_version_14_to_142.html>

I haven’t got time to update the help article.
