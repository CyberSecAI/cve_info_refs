Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Global TV Android & iOS applications were sending analytics data unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Transport:** The application transmits potentially sensitive information over unencrypted channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS).
*   **Unencrypted Analytics:** Specific data points related to the user and their device are sent to both first (CNAME to third) and third-party analytics services without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with the ability to monitor network traffic could intercept and capture the unencrypted data, which includes:
    *   Device model and resolution
    *   Mobile carrier
    *   Days since first use
    *   Days since last use
    *   Total number of app launches
    *   Number of app launches since upgrade
    *   Previous app session length
*   **Privacy Violation:** This exposure of user information can lead to privacy breaches by revealing usage patterns and device details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the user (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or with the ability to intercept network traffic can capture the data during transmission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor network traffic between the user's device and the analytics servers. This can be achieved via:
    *   Being on the same network as the user.
    *   Having the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Global TV apps on both Android (version 2.3.2 and below) and iOS (version 4.7.5 and below).
*   The data is sent to Adobe Experience Cloud and ScorecardResearch, indicating third-party analytics providers were also receiving this data.
*   The issue was reported to Apple, Adobe PSIRT, and the vendor (Global TV), with the vendor being notified on multiple occasions.
*   As of February 4, 2020, the applications were still affected.
