Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8872

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the xHCI component of Parallels Desktop. This inadequate validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the xHCI component.
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can potentially read sensitive information from memory due to the out-of-bounds read.
- Potential for code execution: The advisory mentions that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the hypervisor context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker needs local access to the guest system.
- High-privileged code execution: The attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the guest operating system.
- Ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest OS.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Parallels Desktop version 15.1.3 (47255).
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-11-20.
