Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8337:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Synaptics Smart Audio UWP app failed to use proper quoting in a service name string when referencing a service located within the `c:\Program Files\WindowsApp` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability due to improper string quoting.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization on the service path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local administrator attacker can achieve privilege escalation to the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account by placing a malicious executable named `Program.exe` in the `c:\` directory. This malicious executable will be executed instead of the intended service, granting the attacker system-level privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a local administrator attacker placing a specifically named executable in the root of the `c:\` drive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local administrator privileges on the system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to place an executable file in the `c:\` directory.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.0.83.0 of the Smart Audio UWP app associated with the DCHU audio drivers on Lenovo platforms.
- The fix is in version 1.0.83.0 (or later) of the Smart Audio app which installs with the corresponding audio driver version.
- Despite the privilege escalation, the impact score is zero because administrators already have the ability to execute code as the System account using other methods.
