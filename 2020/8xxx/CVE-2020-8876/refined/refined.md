Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the IOCTL handler of the Parallels Desktop OS X host kernel module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The insufficient validation allows an attacker to trigger a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can leverage the out-of-bounds read to disclose sensitive information from the kernel memory.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: The advisory states that this vulnerability, when combined with other vulnerabilities, can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack requires local access to the target system.
- Low-Privileged Code Execution: The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- IOCTL Handler: The vulnerability is located within the IOCTL handler of the Parallels Desktop OS X kernel module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have obtained the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- Fixed in version 15.1.3 (47255)
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-02-26 and publicly released on 2020-03-13
