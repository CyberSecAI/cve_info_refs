- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the `cevakrnl.rv0` module within Bitdefender Engines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS) by providing a specially crafted sample.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the scanning process. An attacker would need to provide a malicious sample to the Bitdefender Engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted sample for scanning by the affected Bitdefender Engines. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but would need some means of having the crafted sample scanned by the engine.
