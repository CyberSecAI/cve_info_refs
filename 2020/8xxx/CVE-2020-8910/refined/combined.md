[`c6e4fe0`](/google/closure-library/commit/c6e4fe00649bd57f575538261d6b9efb90100787)

**New Additions**

* Add SafeHtml.comment.

**Security Fixes**

* Fixes [CVE-2020-8910](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh5w-fg69-rc8m "CVE-2020-8910").

**Backwards Incompatible Changes**

* Delete inlay css styles, which are not actually used by Closure.
* Add non-nullable modifier to return type of functions never returning null.
* Remove forwardDeclares from Closure Events Listenable by reducing the typing of the event key's src property to just Listenable, instead of Listenable|EventTarget. Note that EventTarget is the primary implementation of Listenable.

**Other Changes**

* Added SafeUrl.fromMediaSource()
* Fix authority parsing in Closure URI parser.
* Document mode is now based on user agent on IE if not present in document
* Add a define to module manager so that we can control module loading behaviors.
* Add non-nullable modifier to return type of functions never returning null.
* goog.isArray in deprecated in favor of Array.isArray
* Update Thenable.then rejection handler JSDoc to reflect actual functionality.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
