Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper input validation within the `goog.uri` URL parsing functionality of the Google Closure Library. Specifically, the regex used to split the URI components incorrectly parses the authority part of the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The regex used to parse the authority component of a URL (`goog.uri.utils.splitRe_`) had an issue that allowed for an incorrect parsing of URLs with a malicious username or invalid characters in the host component.
- The regex was not correctly handling URLs like `https://malicious.com\@test.google.com`.
- The authority part (user info, domain, port) was not correctly delimited. The fix uses `(?=[/\\\\#?]|$).` which specifies a character class for the authority-terminating character.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft malicious URLs that, when parsed by the vulnerable library, can result in the library returning an incorrect authority part.
- This could lead to various issues depending on how the parsed URL is used, potentially leading to security bypasses or misdirection of requests to unintended servers.
- Specifically, the vulnerability could result in the application believing the URL has an authority of `malicious.com` when it actually should be `test.google.com` (in the example `https://malicious.com\@test.google.com`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send a malicious URL to an application that uses the vulnerable Google Closure Library.
- The attack requires a user to interact with the crafted URL, such as clicking a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send or have the victim interact with malicious URLs.
- No special privileges are required as the vulnerability is triggered during the parsing process.
- The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the target application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves modifying the regex used to parse the URL components in `closure/goog/uri/utils.js`.
- The vulnerable versions are up to and including `v20200224.0.0`.
- The patched version is `20200315.0.0`.
- The commit `294fc00b01d248419d8f8de37580adf2a0024fc9` introduced the fix.
- The vulnerability has a moderate severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5.
- This issue was assigned CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.
