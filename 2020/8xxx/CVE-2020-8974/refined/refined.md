- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ZGR TPS200 NG firmware upload process does not perform any type of restriction.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, specifically of a file with dangerous type (CWE-434).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the firmware and re-upload it via web with malicious modifications, potentially rendering the device unusable. The impact is high in terms of integrity and availability, but there is no confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker with network access to the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the web interface of the ZGR TPS200 NG device and be able to upload files. No authentication is required.
