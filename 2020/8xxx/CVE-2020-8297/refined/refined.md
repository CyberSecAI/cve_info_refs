Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability addressed in the pull request:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user was deleted from Nextcloud Deck, the boards they owned were not properly removed. This could lead to orphaned data and potential data leaks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete deletion of user data: When a user was deleted, their associated boards were not being removed. This meant that data linked to the user remained within the application.
- Potential data leak: The orphaned boards still existed, potentially containing sensitive information not associated to a valid user anymore and thus becoming a potential data leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exposure: Orphaned boards, which may contain sensitive information, could remain accessible through the system or database, potentially becoming a data leak.
- Inconsistency: The lack of full data removal created an inconsistency in the application's data model.
- Resource waste: The unreferenced data would continue to occupy server resources without any purpose, consuming space.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is not directly exploitable via network attacks, but it stems from an internal logic flaw.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a normal user management action (user deletion).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to know about the existence of this orphaned data (e.g. direct database access or other kind of access to the internal data structures) to leverage it.
- They might require access to the system database to try to extract the information contained in the orphaned data.
- There is no network attack vector described, this is an internal application flaw.

**Additional details:**
- The fix was implemented in pull request #1976 in the nextcloud/deck repository on GitHub.
- The fix ensures that user boards are removed upon user deletion.
- The pull request also addressed the issue of shared boards, stating that ACL entries are also removed upon user deletion.
- Reviewers suggested adding a clean-up step for boards of already deleted users during app upgrades to address potential past occurrences.
