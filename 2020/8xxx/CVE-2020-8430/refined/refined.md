Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an open redirect flaw in the captive portal of Stormshield Network Security (SNS) devices. An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when accessed by an administrator, redirects them to a fake authentication page controlled by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirect: The captive portal does not properly validate the redirection target, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL for redirection.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize user-provided URLs that are part of the captive portal redirect mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Credential Theft: By redirecting the administrator to a fake login page, the attacker can steal their credentials (username and password).
- Potential for Further Attacks: With stolen administrator credentials, an attacker could potentially gain full access to the firewall, allowing them to further compromise the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker crafts a malicious URL to the captive portal and sends it to a firewall administrator. This could be via email, a link on a website, or any other method that delivers a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send or trick a firewall administrator into clicking a malicious URL. They do not require prior authentication or access to the firewall.
- The attacker needs to host a fake authentication page to capture the credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects SNS versions 3.0.0 to 3.7.10, 3.8.0 to 3.10.0, and 4.0.0 to 4.0.1.
-  A workaround is to disable the captive portal until the fix is applied.
- Fixed versions are 3.7.11, 3.10.1 and 4.0.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by DIGITEMIS under responsible disclosure.
-  CVSS v2 base score 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N), temporal score 5.9 due to existing functional exploits.
