*   **Added header to prevent ZendTo being wrapped in an iframe (v5.01-5):** Protection against Clickjacking was implemented by setting the  X-Frame-Options header.
*   **Fixed security vulnerability in New Drop-off form (v4.99-5 Beta):** A security vulnerability within the new drop-off form was addressed.
*   **When picking up a drop-off, the email address passed in the link was not being verified, so opened up a means of attack (v4.99-4 Beta):** This was a security fix for a flaw in the pickup process.
*   **If you knew a valid Claim ID, you could attempt to guess the corresponding Passcode by brute force (v4.99-4 Beta):** This indicates a weak password generation or validation mechanism that has been fixed.
*   **Fixed posting bug in HTTP proxy code if you are using Google's RECAPTCHA (v4.11-13):**  A bug in handling HTTP proxies when using Google's RECAPTCHA was fixed.

*   **Fixed security vulnerabilities pointed out by Patrick Gaikowski (v4.02):**  Security vulnerabilities identified by Patrick Gaikowski were fixed.
*   **Fixed security issue with ClaimID and Passcode being given away to users (v4.03-3):** Security issues related to the ClaimID and Passcode exposure were fixed.

**Root Causes:**

*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Some vulnerabilities arose from using outdated versions of libraries like `moment.js`.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** Several issues were related to improper handling of user input, especially in filenames (XSS) and email addresses.
*   **Insecure File Handling:**  Vulnerabilities related to temporary file handling during upload.
*   **Insecure Authentication/Authorization:** Issues related to cookie security, password handling, session management, and CAPTCHA bypass.
*   **Lack of Security Headers:**  The absence of proper HTTP security headers led to vulnerabilities (e.g. Clickjacking).
*   **SQL Injection**: Vulnerabilities allowing injection of SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
*   SQL Injection
*   Insecure session management.
*   Bypass of CAPTCHA mechanisms
*   Information leakage through temporary files or cookie domains.
*   Clickjacking due to missing X-Frame-Options header
*   Brute-force attacks on authentication.
*   Weak password generation/validation (for ClaimIDs/Passcodes).
*   Improper handling of MIME type strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** XSS vulnerabilities could be used to inject malicious scripts, leading to potential code execution on client browsers.
*   **Data Disclosure:** Information could be leaked through directory browsing or session hijacking.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Vulnerabilities in admin functionalities could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** CAPTCHA bypass and brute-force attacks could lead to DoS.
*   **Information Leakage:** Claim IDs/Passcodes being revealed to unauthenticated users.
*   **Loss of Control:**  If session cookies are compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Most vulnerabilities were exploitable through the web interface, particularly through user input forms, file uploads, and URLs.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Vulnerabilities could be triggered via manipulated HTTP requests
*  **Network:** Brute-force attacks on authentication.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** Most of the vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely by an attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable application.
*   **Unauthenticated user:**  Some vulnerabilities could be triggered by unauthenticated users due to missing security checks.
*  **Malicious users:** Insecure handling of passwords, ClaimIDs and Passcodes.
*  **Users with network access:** Brute force attacks.
*  **Users exploiting insecure cookie handling:**  Could lead to session hijacking.

**Summary:**
The changelog indicates a strong focus on addressing security vulnerabilities across many versions of the software, including fixes for XSS, SQL injection, authentication weaknesses, and other security issues. While CVE-2020-8985 isn't explicitly referenced, the fixes described indicate a commitment to improving the security posture of the application.

It's important to note that the changelog doesn't always provide detailed technical explanations for each fix, and it's often necessary to have access to the codebase to understand the full scope of the vulnerability. It does provide more details than the CVE description, including specific vulnerabilities and the version they were fixed in.
