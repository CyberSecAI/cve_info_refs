Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the "improper removal of sensitive information before storage or transfer" within certain Intel processors. This means that data which should have been sanitized or purged was not, leading to potential exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the presence of sensitive data in locations where it shouldn't be, due to improper handling before storage or transfer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker needs to be running code on the affected system.
*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the system as a valid user.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources**

*   **Fedora Update Notification:** The Fedora update addresses CVE-2020-8696 by updating the `microcode_ctl` package, which includes updated microcode for various Intel processors. This mitigates the vulnerability by updating the CPU firmware.
*   **NetApp Advisory:** NetApp confirms that multiple of their products are affected by CVE-2020-8696 and other related vulnerabilities (Intel SA-00381). It provides a CVSS score of 2.8 (LOW) for CVE-2020-8696, and notes the vulnerability requires local access with a low-privileged user. Patches are provided in the BIOS firmware updates.
*   **Debian LTS Advisory:** The Debian advisory describes CVE-2020-8696 as an improper removal of sensitive data, which may lead to information disclosure via local access by an authenticated user. The fix is delivered through an updated `intel-microcode` package.

In summary, CVE-2020-8696 is an information disclosure vulnerability in some Intel processors arising from the improper handling of sensitive data before storage or transfer, requiring an authenticated local user to exploit.
