Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-8464:

**Root Cause:**

- The Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) administration web interface does not properly perform authentication checks when requests originate from localhost.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The system incorrectly trusts requests coming from localhost, bypassing normal authentication procedures.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The IWSVA acts as an HTTP proxy. This allows an attacker to send requests through the proxy, making them appear as if they are originating from localhost, thereby bypassing the authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can gain access to the administrative interface of the IWSVA without proper authentication.
- This access can be used as a stepping stone to further attacks like command execution and taking over the appliance as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker uses the IWSVA's own HTTP proxy to send requests that appear to originate from localhost. This bypasses authentication checks that are not enforced for localhost requests.
-  By chaining this vulnerability with an authorization bypass (CVE-2020-8463) the attacker can access any script on the administration interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests through the IWSVA proxy (typically port 8080). This means the attacker could be an internal user with access to the proxy port or an external attacker if the proxy port is exposed.
- No prior authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending requests through the IWSVA proxy that target the administrative interface and appear to come from localhost.
- This bypasses authentication and allows an attacker to perform administrative actions.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is often chained with other vulnerabilities like CSRF bypass (CVE-2020-8461) and command execution (CVE-2020-8465) to achieve unauthenticated remote root access.
- The provided advisory contains a python script that demonstrates this attack but is not included in the advisory for security reasons.
- A proof-of-concept video demonstrating unauthenticated takeover of the appliance is provided.
