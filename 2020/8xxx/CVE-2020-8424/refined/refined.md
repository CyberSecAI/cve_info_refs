**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to induce a logged-in user (particularly an administrator) of the vulnerable CUPS Easy application to visit a malicious page or open an email.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication with the CUPS Easy application as they are leveraging an existing session of the victim.

**Additional Information:**
