### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)

Confidential data is written in an unprotected file, which may allow an attacker to login to the affected node as a low privileged user and read confidential data from an unprotected file.

[CVE-2020-8481](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8481) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to an external entity injection, which may allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the license server and/or from the network. An attacker could also block the license handling.

[CVE-2020-8479](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8479) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)).

#### 3.2.3    [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, which may allow an attacker to successfully block license handling.

[CVE-2020-8475](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8475) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)).

#### 3.2.4    [PERMISSIONS, PRIVILEGES, AND ACCESS CONTROLS CWE-264](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to elevation of privileges, which may allow an attacker to alter licenses assigned to system nodes. This could potentially lead to a situation where legitimate nodes in the system network are denied licenses.

[CVE-2020-8476](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8476) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)).

#### 3.2.5    [IMPROPER ACCESS CONTROL CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to weak file permissions, which may allow an attacker to block license handling, escalate privileges, and execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2020-8471](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-8471) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

ABB recommends the following mitigations:

* Upgrade ABB CLS to the following versions:
  + 5.1 Rev A (5.1.0.38)
  + 5.1 Rev E (5.1.0.99)
  + 6.0 (6.0.0.26)
  + 6.0.3.3 (6.0.03000.192)
  + 6.1 RU1 (6.1.00100.417)
  + If ABB Central Licensing Server 5.1 (5.1.0.14) or earlier has been used on the currently used hardware, please contact ABB for further assistance.
* Vulnerabilities pertaining to CVE-2020-8475 and CVE-2020-8476 will be corrected in future product versions. Updates will be added to this advisory once they become available.
* Methods for preventing unauthorized access to nodes on the CLS network include but are not limited to usage of IPSec and by separating the Client Server Network from other networks with firewalls.
* Ensure only authorized individuals have access to user accounts on the system nodes.
* Interactive login to service accounts should be blocked.

For more information, please see [ABB's cybersecurity advisory](https://search-ext.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=2PAA121231&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
