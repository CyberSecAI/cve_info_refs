Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `start` and `length` parameters within the `Records.php` file, specifically in the `listRecords()` method. These parameters are directly incorporated into the SQL query's `LIMIT` clause without any checks, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is SQL injection, a type of vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate SQL queries by inserting malicious SQL code through user-supplied inputs. In this case, the `start` and `length` parameters passed through the POST request are used directly in the `LIMIT` clause of the SQL query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to sanitize or validate user-controlled inputs before using them in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** By injecting malicious SQL code via `start` and `length` parameters, an attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   **Data Exposure:** This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful SQL injection can potentially allow further attacks, like privilege escalation or even full system compromise depending on the database userâ€™s permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `ajax_action.php` file, where the `start` and `length` parameters are manipulated within the request data.
*   **`start` and `length` Parameters:** The injection is performed by crafting malicious values for the `start` and `length` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how HTTP requests work, as well as some understanding of SQL syntax and how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited.
*   **SQL Injection Tools (Optional):** The attacker can use automated tools such as `sqlmap` to identify and exploit the vulnerability, although manual exploitation is possible.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists in the following lines of code in `Records.php`:
```php
if($_POST["length"] != -1){
    $sqlQuery .= 'LIMIT ' . $_POST['start'] . ', ' . $_POST['length'];
}
```

The exploit code provided demonstrates how to use sqlmap to exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `search[value]` parameter, which is related but not the vulnerable parameter of focus for CVE-2020-8521. However, sqlmap can also test other injection points. The vulnerable parameters are `start` and `length` POST parameters in `ajax_action.php`

**Summary of CVE-2020-8521:**

CVE-2020-8521 refers to a SQL injection vulnerability in the `LIMIT` clause of a SQL query in `Records.php` of phpzag's "Live Add Edit Delete Datatables Records" application. Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious SQL code through the `start` and `length` POST parameters, leading to arbitrary SQL execution and potentially significant data breaches, modification or loss.
