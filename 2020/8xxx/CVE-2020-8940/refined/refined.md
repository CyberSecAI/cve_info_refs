{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code in `enc_untrusted_recvmsg` function in `asylo/platform/host_call/trusted/host_calls.cc` does not properly validate the return value of `recvmsg`. Specifically, it checks if `result` exceeds `total_buffer_size`, but doesn't check if `result` is negative, which indicates an error from `recvmsg`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of `recvmsg` return value which can lead to a crash if the function returns an error (-1).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The enclave can crash if `recvmsg` returns a negative value, which is an error condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can potentially trigger an error condition in the underlying `recvmsg` call through an untrusted host or via network conditions, leading to the enclave crashing. The untrusted side can send a crafted message to trigger this.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the network or cause an error on the untrusted host that affects the recvmsg call. "
