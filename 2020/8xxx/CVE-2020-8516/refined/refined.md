{
  "CVE-2020-8516": {
    "description": "The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through 0.4.2.6 does not verify that a rendezvous node is known before attempting to connect to it, which might make it easier for remote attackers to discover circuit information. NOTE: The network team of Tor claims this is an intended behavior and not a vulnerability",
    "root_cause": "The Tor daemon does not validate if a rendezvous node is a known, legitimate Tor node before attempting a connection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of rendezvous node verification"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure; potential for deanonymization. An attacker can potentially discover information about the Tor circuit used by a hidden service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending connection requests to a Tor hidden service using rendezvous points not part of the Tor network."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the capability to create and control a Tor node and send connection requests to a Tor hidden service.",
        "additional_info": "The Tor network team claims this behavior is intentional for specific reasons and not a vulnerability. This issue can be leveraged to map the last relay of a hidden service's circuit and potentially identify guard nodes through exclusion. The described attack involves using a custom Tor node as rendezvous point to map circuits, and is a known attack scenario that the Tor project has tried to mitigate with Vanguards. However, simply forcing rendezvous points to be part of the consensus would not fix this issue."
