# CVE-2020-8516

| **Name** | CVE-2020-8516 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through 0.4.2.6 does not verify that a rendezvous node is known before attempting to connect to it, which might make it easier for remote attackers to discover circuit information. NOTE: The network team of Tor claims this is an intended behavior and not a vulnerability |

We (network team) actually don't think this is a bug but it is actually done
on purpose for specific reasons. Please see asn's answer on
<https://bugs.torproject.org/33129> that explains why that is.

Onto the bigger issue at ends that the post explains. I'm going to extract the
relevant quote that this post is all about:

    Remember: the guard rarely changes but the other two hops change often.
    If he can repeatedly map out my circuit's last node, then he can build a
    large exclusion list. If he can exclude everything else, then he can find
    my guard node. And if he can't exclude everything, then he can probably
    whittle it down to a handful of possible guard nodes.

That is indeed a known attack. One can create a set of relays from the 3rd
node (last one before connecting to the rendezvous point) selected by the
service and doing enough requests to the service, you can end up with a very
large set of relays that can _not_ be your Guard due to how path selection
works as explained in the blog post.

You probably won't end up with one single Guard but rather a small set of
relays that could be it. For instance, if the service has setup ExcludeNodes
then they will all be in your set.

And the reason for private nodes is probably because this way you eliminate
noise from other tor traffic so _anything_ connecting back to your ORPort is
related to the onion service connections you've done. You don't need to filter
out the circuits with some custom code (which is very easy to do anyway).

That is unfortunately a problem that onion service have. These types of guard
discovery attacks exists and they are the primary reasons why we came up with
Vanguards couple years ago:

<https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-vanguards-add-onion-services>

But one thing for sure, simply forcing rendezvous points to be part of the
consensus will _not_ fix this problem as it is fairly easy to pull this type
of attack by simply using a normal relay within the consensus.

Hope this help!
David

# Tor node that is not part of the consensus should not be used as rendezvous point with the onion service

According to this article attacker is able to to chose a server that is running Tor but is not part of the Tor network as an rendezvous point with the onion service so that he can discover in to which family onion service`s guard node belongs and than use that information to ddos Tor nodes in that family so that onion service drops that guard node and instead chose his Tor node as a guard node.

# [Deanonymizing Tor Circuits](/blog/index.php?/archives/868-Deanonymizing-Tor-Circuits.html)

## Saturday, 1 February 2020

Since starting my Tor onion service that provides access to the Internet Archive, I've seen a wide range of Tor-based attacks. I have documented many of these in various blog entries. For example:

* [Attacked Over Tor](/blog/index.php?/archives/762-Attacked-Over-Tor.html): 3 bad bots, 1 aggressive crawler, and 1 attack bot.

* [Stopping Tor Attacks](/blog/index.php?/archives/777-Stopping-Tor-Attacks.html): Mitigation options for aggressive, abusive, and DDoS bots.

* [Tor Attacks Revisited](/blog/index.php?/archives/791-Tor-Attacks-Revisited.html): Lots of different types of attacks that my server has encountered over the Tor connection.

* [A New Tor Attack](/blog/index.php?/archives/804-A-New-Tor-Attack.html): An updated solution for an updated attack.

Over the last month, I've noticed a new type of attack. It took me a while to figure out what they are trying to do: they appear to be trying to map out part of the Tor circuit used by my hidden service.

(In this blog entry, you'll see Tor spelled "Tor" and "tor". Uppercase is the protocol's name, while lowercase is the name of the program.)

### Typical Usage

In order to identify attacks, you must first identify typical usage. Unfortunately, even in full debug mode, the basic tor-daemon source code does not provide enough information. I've modified my copy of the source code to be much more informative. For example, my tor daemon logs every rendezvous point. Basically, I edited src/or/rendservice.c and added a print statement to the function rend\_service\_receive\_introduction:
> ```
>   tor_assert(launched->build_state);
>
>
>
>   /** Neal: Log rendezvous point **/
>
>   log_warn(LD_REND,"Rendezvous [%s]", safe_str_client(extend_info_describe(rp)));
>
>
>   /* Fill in the circuit's state. */
> ```

(And before anyone asks: No, this does not violate your privacy. The rendezvous is an intermediary node located outside of the initial circuits established by both the browser and the service. And yes, logs are automatically deleted after a week.)

With typical usage, I'll see the tor daemon connect to a rendezvous point, and then a moment later there will be a bunch of HTTP connections to the server. For example, this is me connecting to my server over Tor with the Tor Browser:

> ```

The IP address from the rendezvous point is always a Tor node, and the hex values before it is the Tor node's unique fingerprint. This is public and published information, and you can look it up at [metrics.torproject.org](https://metrics.torproject.org/). In this case, the [rendezvous node](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/F5746F6257DFE87E3A90753C2A0439926C55552F) has the nickname "Hijnn", it exists at 82.169.130.61, and when I wrote this, it had been up for 8 days 21 hours 32 minutes and 47 seconds.

With Tor, the entry node (guard) can be publicly listed or kept unlisted. (The unlisted guard nodes are usually reserved as *bridges* -- unlisted to prevent IP-based censorship.) However, the relay, rendezvous, and exit nodes must be publicly known so that lots of Tor traffic will use them. This is part of Tor's anonymity: your traffic is indistinguishable from everyone else.

Note: Technically, you can run your own private exit node, but this defeats the purpose. If you're the only person using your private exit node, then network activity can be attributed to you. Similarly, the rendezvous node should be a publicly known service so that traffic can commingle for anonymity. You don't want to use your own private rendezvous node since that makes your activity stand out.

### Typical Usage vs Bots

A lot of bots have atypical usage. For example, many bots will only do one HTTP connection at a time (single threaded). And the badly written bots will perform one HTTP request per rendezvous negotiation.

However, aggressive bots can be spotted because they negotiate multiple rendezvous nodes before sending through a large number of HTTP requests. For example:

All of these rendezvous points are known Tor nodes. This is from an agressive crawler that spawns lots of crawling processes at the same time. (The "circuit closing" messages denote my server detecting the crawler and shutting it down before the first GET request. My detection has zero false positives. How you establish connections over Tor is a distinct and profileable attribute. You are not anonymous.)

### Forward in Reverse

Back in 2017, I mentioned one [odd attacker](/blog/index.php?/archives/779-Behind-the-Tor-Attacks.html). (I don't know exactly what he's doing. But since he's not a regular user, I'm classifying it as an attack.) He would specify the rendezvous address, but it would be in the wrong endian (wrong byte order). For example, 95.216.53.157 is a known Tor node, but this bot would request a rendezvous using the numbers in reverse: 157.53.216.95. The reversed address is *not* a know Tor node. Even the server fingerprints were wrong. As a result, the connection requests would fail, but that didn't stop him from trying over and over.

This went on for years. Oddly, sometimes the connection would succeed. My suspicion is that he was running some hostile nodes. If he saw the reverse address or wrong fingerprint, then he would correct it. This could be used as a flag to track the traffic volume or identify the last node in my server's Tor circuit.

### Private Address Bot

Late last year, the reverse-address bot stopped. It was replaced by (what I'm calling) the private-address bot. Here's a few examples:

There are usually 8-10 requests at a time, and these clusters repeat a few times per hour. The IP addresses are not random; I'll see the same IPs come through in batches. According to [metrics.torproject.org](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search), the IP addresses and fingerprints are not known Tor nodes; they don't even show up in my tor daemon's cache of known descriptors. However, these IPs *are* running Tor and have the OR port open (9001/tcp).

Unlike the reverse-address bot, which provided bogus addresses, these IPs are all known cloud providers. (Usually Choopa LLC -- a cloud provider that is regularly used by [hostile actors](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/).)

As far as I can tell, this developer is shooting out packets and waiting to see which Tor node responds. This way, they know that my onion service uses this specific node in the Tor relay.

If you use the Tor Browser, then you can view your Tor circuit (path through the Tor network). For example:

![](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=d714473f0ec4b6ab14b8338402fa2959a1286be1.65083&fmt=orig)

The typical path between the browser and Tor onion service has 7 hops: from my browser to my guard (in this example, located in the UK) and through two relays (France and Germany). At the same time, the onion service has a guard and two relays that are unknown to the Tor Browser. (The image shows "Relay, Relay Relay", but that bottom Relay is the service's guard.) What you are seeing are two Tor circuits, one from the browser out, and one from the service in, that meet in the middle.

So what is this attacker doing? I think he's trying to map out the next unknown relay! And since the circuit changes every few minutes, he's repeatedly mapping out the current "last relay" used by my onion service.

### Chaining Exploits

Identifying the last node in my circuit does not tell him where I am located. However, this does provide useful information to the attacker. (What is he doing? He's trying to find my guard node!)

Some Tor nodes are part of registered families. That is, a bunch of Tor nodes that are all run by the same organization. For example, niftyspinymouse ([5.196.213.57](https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#details/986E29FB17C8C7A1FEAFF203F012D5930BA079DB)) is part of a large family of related Tor nodes. (As I am writing this, there are currently 68 active nodes in this family. This screenshot just shows some of them.)

![](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=a1a5d1d42487ae82066789d049ae1ed0dc422044.143810&fmt=orig)

The Tor guard node rarely changes, even if the rest of the circuit changes often. Moreover, the tor daemon will never make a circuit using two nodes that are part of the same known family. So if he sees that my route uses niftyspinymouse, then he can immediate determine that my guard node is not any of these 68 Tor nodes.

Remember: the guard rarely changes but the other two hops change often. If he can repeatedly map out my circuit's last node, then he can build a large exclusion list. If he can exclude everything else, then he can find my guard node. And if he can't exclude everything, then he can probably whittle it down to a handful of possible guard nodes.

Identifying the possible guard node does not tell him my server's real address. However, there's a known attack where an attacker DDoS's the guard node. This will disable the guard and temporarily knock my service offline -- until my service renegotiates with a new guard. But the guard still doesn't identify where my server is located.

However, there's a second attack. The attacker can run one or more hostile guard nodes. If he can knock me off enough guards, my tor daemon will eventually choose one of his guards. Then he can identify my actual network address and directly attack my server. (This happened to me once.)

Alternately, the tor daemon tracks bad nodes. If he can get my tor daemon to mark enough nodes as bad, then he can knock my service offline because the tor process won't be able to connect to any guards. (And yes, that's happened before. That was one of the nastier outages that my onion service experienced.)

### Mitigating Attacks

There are a few mitigation options here. (I'm using them, but I doubt other people are doing this. Each requires some serious programming. Unfortunately, the Tor Project has been less than open to implementing any kind of mitigation option.)

The first option is to use the torrc's [ExcludeNodes](https://gist.github.com/pwnsdx/effd82f4791bf90d8de6) to exclude entire countries (e.g., `ExcludeNodes {br},{ru},{pl}`) along with "`StrictNodes 1`". This tells my tor daemon to never intentionally connect to nodes in certain countries. While trying to identify my guard node, the attacker can rule out much of the Tor network. However, there are always at least a few hundred possible places where my guard could be located -- and that is assuming that I'm not using a bridge. (My modified tor daemon randomly excludes different countries each time it chooses a new guard. The Tor Project should seriously consider making this a configuration option for onion servers.)

The second option is to change the server's IP address. This way, even if they find your address, you become a moving target. With IPv4, you may be stuck with a fixed address because there are so few addresses available. However, if you use IPv6, then this is relatively easy to setup. I mean, sure, if the attacker somehow becomes my guard, then he knows my IPv6 address and can quickly narrow my subnet down to a /64 or /92 range. But there are still millions of addresses for my server to use. Each time I choose a new guard, I can choose a new address. (If only Tor had better IPv6 support. Right [Joe](https://twitter.com/joeklein/) and [IPv6Sec](https://twitter.com/ipv6sec)? Right now, only about 15% of Tor nodes support IPv6, and you can't run an IPv6-only Tor node.)

Finally, there is a third option: Every tor daemon downloads the list of known public nodes and stores it locally while it is running. (See `$HOME/.tor/cached-microdescs*`) And the rendezvous point *must* be in this list (because you shouldn't have a private rendezvous node). If the tor daemon checked to see if the rendezvous node was known before attempting to connect to it, then this attack would completely fail. (Seriously, Tor Project. Consider adding this.)

(Too bad ExcludeNodes doesn't support ASNs. Otherwise, I would suggest blacklisting all of Choopa.)

If you run any kind of service on the plain old Internet, then you are bound to see blind scans and generic attacks. WordPress exploits, SQL injections, and scans for the latest vulnerabilities are common. Once in a blue moon, you might see a specific and directed attack. But on Tor? I often see more attacks and badly behaved bots than regular users. And very few are drive-by generic attacks. From a researcher viewpoint, I see some of the most creative attacks over Tor.

**Update 2020-02-12**: The scanner stopped on 6-Feb-2020. All of the unknown rendezvous node requests stopped at the same time. This was not due to the Tor Project making a code change; this was the person/people running the de-anonymization attack turning off their scan.

**[Edit 2020-02-02]** I had ExcludeExitNodes, but it should have been ExcludeNodes. I have corrected the text.

Ability to use a Tor node that is not part of the consensus as a rendezvous point is probably a sidefect of the intended feature for using private bridges.

> Because only about 15% of Tor nodes support IPv6, it means much less security for IPv6-only clients. In particular, there are nearly 3000 Tor guard nodes, but only about 800 of them (27%) support IPv6. So as an IPv6-only client, you have limited yourself to less than a third of the available Tor entries. (Fewer connection options means you are easier to track.)

# CVE-2020-8516

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-8492.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-8517.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-8516 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8516)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* The daemon in Tor through 0.4.1.8 and 0.4.2.x through 0.4.2.6 does not verify that a rendezvous node is known before attempting to connect to it, which might make it easier for remote attackers to discover circuit information. NOTE: The network team of Tor claims this is an intended behavior and not a vulnerability.

Since no one is posting it here and talking about it, I will post it.

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8516>

The guy:
<http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/868-Deanonymizing-Tor-Circuits.html>

Is this real?

Are we actually not verifying if the IP of the Rend is a node in the Tor
network?

```
