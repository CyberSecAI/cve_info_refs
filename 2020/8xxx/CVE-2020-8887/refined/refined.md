Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located in the `index.php` file of Telestream/Tektronix Sentry and Medius platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input (specifically, the username and password) is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to dump the entire contents of databases stored on the system. This includes sensitive information such as:
    *   Database schemas
    *   Table structures
    *   Channel/feed subscriptions
    *   User data (as indicated by the example dumping of the 'users' table)
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it particularly critical.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a POST request to `index.php` with specific parameters to trigger the injection. The parameters are:
    *   `_z=0`
    *   `page=login`
    *   `username=admin`
    *   `passwd=1234`
    *   `submit=+Log+In+`
*   **Cookie:** The exploit also requires the `PHPSESSID` cookie to be set which is required by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, as the exploit is performed over HTTP.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application, making this vulnerability highly exploitable.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests. The usage of tools like sqlmap is also demonstrated.
