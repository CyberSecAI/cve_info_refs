The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-8114.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `ProjectExportWorker` in GitLab did not validate user permissions when processing scheduled exports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of user permission validation in `ProjectExportWorker`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user who has lost access to a project can still trigger and potentially complete a scheduled project export if the export was scheduled prior to losing access.
- A blocked user can repeatedly trigger exports causing system degradation and potentially leading to a full outage.
- The vulnerability could be used to cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user schedules a project export and subsequently loses access to the project (e.g. blocked by admin).
- The `ProjectExportWorker` processes the export without validating the user's current permissions.
- A blocked user can continue to schedule exports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have had prior access to a GitLab project and scheduled an export while they had access.
- The attacker's access must have been revoked before the export was processed.
