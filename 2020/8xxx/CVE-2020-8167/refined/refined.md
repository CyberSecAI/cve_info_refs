Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2015-1840.
- The root cause lies in the `rails-ujs` component, specifically how it handles CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens. It allows these tokens to be sent to wrong domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The core issue is a CSRF vulnerability where the rails-ujs JavaScript library sends CSRF tokens to arbitrary, attacker-controlled domains. This is a critical weakness, as it defeats the purpose of CSRF protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially bypass CSRF protection mechanisms.
- By controlling the `href` attribute of an anchor tag or the `action` attribute of a form tag to point to a malicious cross-origin URL, the attacker can trick the application into sending the CSRF token to their controlled domain.
- This could enable attackers to perform actions on behalf of a user, provided they can trick the user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form.
- If an attacker successfully gets the CSRF token sent to an external, attacker-controlled server, the attacker could then craft malicious requests and send them to the vulnerable application bypassing the CSRF protection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves the attacker controlling the `href` attribute of an anchor tag (`<a>`) or the `action` attribute of a form tag (`<form>`).
-  By setting these attributes to a cross-origin URL, the attacker can trigger the browser to send a POST request to the attacker's server with the CSRF token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence/control the `href` attribute of an anchor tag or the `action` attribute of a form tag within a vulnerable application.
- This could be achieved through a variety of means such as injecting malicious code via a cross-site scripting vulnerability, social engineering or if the application is vulnerable to stored XSS where user-generated content is not properly sanitized.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Affected Versions:**
- `rails <= 6.0.3`
- The vulnerability impacts applications that utilize `rails-ujs`

**Fixed Versions:**
- `rails >= 5.2.4.3`
- `rails >= 6.0.3.1`

**Workarounds:**
- The content suggests filtering user-controlled parameters that are used to generate `href` and `action` attributes. For example, `link_to params` should be replaced with `link_to filtered_params` where `filtered_params` only includes trusted parameters.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Ben Toews of GitHub.
- Patches for `5.2` and `6.0` series were provided.
