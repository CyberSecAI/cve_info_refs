Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on the URLs that Rendertron, a headless browser rendering service, would process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. Rendertron versions prior to 3.0.0 were susceptible to this, allowing an attacker to control the URLs that the headless Chrome browser would render.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to force the Rendertron's headless Chrome process to access and render internal resources or sites that the server had access to. This could expose sensitive information or potentially allow further attacks on internal infrastructure. The rendered output, often as a screenshot, would then be available to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage provided by the attacker. This webpage would instruct Rendertron to render a URL of the attacker's choosing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to submit URLs to the Rendertron service and be able to access the rendered output. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the rendertron server, but would require a way to have the server render an arbitrary url through the service.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Rendertron version 3.0.0.
- The provided content references the fix in the release notes for version 3.0.0, stating "Fixes security issue with AppEngine deployments (fixes [CVE-2020-8902](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xr9h-9m79-x29g "CVE-2020-8902"))".
- The advisory page provides mitigation advice to either update or to secure the infrastructure that the headless chrome has access to.
