Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Western Digital and SanDisk SSD Dashboard installer versions prior to 3.0.2.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The installers are vulnerable to DLL search order hijacking. This means that the installer loads DLL files from locations where a malicious user can place their own DLL files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system user. This means that an attacker could gain control of the system with the same privileges as the user who ran the installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will attempt to load it. This typically involves placing the malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate location of the DLLs.
- The user must then execute the vulnerable installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have write access to a directory in the DLL search path that is processed before the correct one.
- The attacker needs to know which DLLs the installer loads in order to craft the malicious DLL.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text clarifies that the vulnerability is present in the installer itself (`WesternDigitalSSDDashboardSetup.exe` and `SanDiskSSDDashboardSetup.exe`).
- The fix is to use updated installers (version 3.0.2.0 or later) for installation or uninstallation.
- The vulnerability was reported by Eli Paz and Eran Shimony of Cyberark Labs.
- The content also mentions the specific CVE ID associated with the vulnerability: CVE-2020-8959.
