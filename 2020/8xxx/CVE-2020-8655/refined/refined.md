Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-8655:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided content from GitHub describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in EyesOfNetwork (EON) version 5.3. It does not match CVE-2020-8655 which, based on its CVE description is a placeholder.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure sudo configurations for the `apache` user in EON 5.3. Specifically, the `apache` user is granted `NOPASSWD` privileges to execute `systemctl` commands for various services, as well as `nmap`.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the excessive permissions granted to the `apache` user via `sudo`. The inclusion of `/usr/bin/nmap` is particularly dangerous since it can be used to execute arbitrary commands using NSE scripts with root privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, by leveraging the `apache` user’s privileges, can achieve arbitrary command execution as the root user.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker who is able to control the apache user (e.g., through webserver vulnerabilities) can escalate privileges.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in control of a context that allows them to execute commands as the `apache` user. Additionally, the attacker needs to have the capacity to craft/use a custom NSE script to exploit the `nmap` functionality.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the following sudo configuration:

```
apache ALL=NOPASSWD:/bin/systemctl * snmptt,/bin/systemctl * snmptrapd,/bin/systemctl * snmpd,/bin/systemctl * nagios,/bin/systemctl * gedd,/usr/bin/nmap
```

The attacker can exploit this by using an NSE script with `nmap`, which will execute with the effective user ID of `root`.

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in EON 5.3, specifically due to insecure sudo configurations. An attacker can leverage the `apache` user’s `nmap` privileges to execute arbitrary commands as root using a specially crafted NSE script.

**Response:**

The content does not relate to the actual CVE-2020-8655, which is a placeholder, but describes a privilege escalation issue found in EyesOfNetwork (EON) version 5.3.
