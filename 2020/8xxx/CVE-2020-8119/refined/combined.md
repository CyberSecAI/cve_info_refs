Yes, leap is 15.0.7  But in CVE stands "16.0.1". So i read this, that the bug is only in 16er branch. Not in 15er branch. Because in other issues it is written with explicitly 15.0.3 or so. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1162782#c5)  Robert Frohl   2020-02-06 15:14:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Schirra from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1162782#c4)) > But in CVE stands "16.0.1".

The reason is that upstream did only mention the newest version in their NIST submission. The tool which helps us to monitor CVEs is using this text for the initial comment. I looked at the nextcloud advisory [0] for the version numbers that I reported in my second comments.  I realize now that I probably should have been a bit more verbose about this. Sorry about the back and forth. I think the open bugs which are left now should still affect Leap.
