Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authorization within the Nextcloud server, specifically when handling file-drop share links in conjunction with the gallery app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that the system does not correctly verify a user's authorization when accessing shared files or previews via the gallery app using a file-drop link. This leads to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to previews and files that were intended to be shared only with specific users, resulting in a leak of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File-drop Share Links:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting file-drop share links. These are typically used for allowing users to upload files to a shared folder. By accessing such a link through the gallery app, an attacker could bypass intended access controls.
- **Gallery App:** The gallery app is the specific context in which the improper authorization is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of File-drop Share Link:** The attacker needs to have access to or knowledge of a valid file-drop share link.
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need to have an account or any administrative rights on the server. The vulnerability can be triggered by simply accessing the affected app through a specific url.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Nextcloud Server 17.0.0.
- The issue was resolved in Nextcloud version 15.0.14 and later.
- The vulnerability is considered a "moderate" severity issue.
- The bug is referenced in the following SUSE bug tracker: [1162781](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1162781)
