Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-8891:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content shows commits related to fixes for bruteforce protection within the MISP project, which is related to security hardening. Though there is no direct mention of the CVE, it is highly likely that these commits are related to a reported vulnerability, and were assigned the CVE id: CVE-2020-8891.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause appears to be insufficient bruteforce protection logic, specifically related to:
  - Case sensitivity when checking usernames.
  - Potential time discrepancies between the MySQL server and webserver that caused the bruteforce subsystem to fail
  - Inadequate checks on login attempts.
  - Incorrect calculation of the expiry time for blacklisting.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Case-insensitive username check**: The original code was not performing case-insensitive checks, allowing attackers to bypass the bruteforce protection using a different case of the same username. The code was updated to use `LOWER(Bruteforce.username)` in the query to address this issue.
   - **Time Divergence**: Inconsistency between time settings of the web server and the MySQL server could cause incorrect calculations for the expiry time of blacklisted entries.
   - **Insufficient Checks**: There was a potential for foul play due to loose checks. The fixes involve tightening of the checks.
   - **Incorrect Blacklisting Time**: The code was using `Configure::read('SecureAuth.expire')` directly in a string, instead of calculating the time using `time()` for the expiration.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to perform unlimited login attempts by bypassing bruteforce protection via case-variation of usernames.
   - It is likely that if the time synchronization between the database and webserver were incorrect, the bruteforce mechanism could be circumvented.
   - An attacker could potentially launch a bruteforce attack, without being locked out, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is through the login form.
   - An attacker can repeatedly try different usernames in varying cases or try to cause database and server time divergence.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs to have knowledge of a valid username, but not the correct password.
   - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login interface.
   - No special privileges or access is needed, other than the ability to submit login requests.

**Technical Details:**

The commits show changes to the `app/Model/Bruteforce.php` and `app/Controller/UsersController.php` files:

*   **app/Model/Bruteforce.php:**
    *   The `isBlacklisted` function now uses `LOWER(Bruteforce.username)` for case-insensitive checks.
    *   The `insert` function now calculates the correct expiry time using `time()`.
    *   The `clean` function now calculates the expiry time based on the webserver time and database driver (MySql or Postgres) to delete expired entries
*   **app/Controller/UsersController.php:**
    *   Added the check to make sure that the message "Invalid username or password, try again" only appears after the first login attempt is made.

In summary, the provided content shows the fixes related to a bruteforce protection bypass in MISP via multiple attack vectors, addressing issues such as case-sensitivity, incorrect time calculations and weak checks.
