Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to forge per-form CSRF tokens by exploiting a global CSRF token present in the `authenticity_token` meta tag. This means that with access to the global token, an attacker can generate valid CSRF tokens for any action within that session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The vulnerability indicates a weakness in how per-form CSRF tokens are generated or validated within the Rails framework. The reliance on or the derivative nature of the per-form tokens from the global token makes them predictable and forgeable.
- **Predictable Token Generation:** The core issue is that the per-form tokens are not sufficiently randomized or protected against derivation from the global token, allowing attackers to craft valid tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF Attacks:** By forging per-form CSRF tokens, an attacker could execute actions on behalf of a victim user, provided that they can extract the global CSRF token. This could include changing user settings, making unwanted purchases, or any other action the user can perform on the application.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** If an attacker can successfully manipulate actions through CSRF that affect different parts of the application, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTML Injection:** An attacker would need to first have a way to obtain the global CSRF token. This typically involves an HTML injection vulnerability within the application. The attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript) to extract the token from the meta tag.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** It may be possible for an attacker positioned on the network to extract the global token through a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Extract the Global CSRF Token:** The primary requirement is for the attacker to be able to extract the global CSRF token, often from an authenticity\_token meta tag present in the application's HTML.
- **HTML Injection Vulnerability:** Often, this requires the attacker to exploit an existing HTML injection vulnerability within the Rails application.
- **Knowledge of Application Routes:** The attacker needs knowledge of the application routes to create the per-form CSRF tokens.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** Rails versions prior to 5.2.5 and 6.0.4 are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** Patches are available in versions 5.2.4.3 and 6.0.3.1 and later.
- **Severity:** The issue is considered to be of "low-severity".
- **Workaround:** No specific workaround is mentioned other than upgrading. Patches are also made available for Rails 6.0.3 and Rails 5.2.4.2.
