- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the way Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac handles the DYLD environment variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is susceptible to code injection via manipulation of the DYLD environment variable, which can be leveraged to load arbitrary libraries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute third-party code. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact according to the provided CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) on the system and does not require user interaction (UI:N). The attack does not require a change in scope (S:U).
