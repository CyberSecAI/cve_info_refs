Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2020-8960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected and DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `mycloud.com` cloud services. This means the application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected through a crafted request and reflected back to the user's browser.
*  **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability exists within the client-side scripts and how they handle data within the Document Object Model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal a user's session cookie.
*   **Account Takeover:** By gaining access to a user's session, the attacker can take over their cloud account.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser session.
*   **Access to Application Data:** Attackers can access sensitive application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A victim needs to be tricked into issuing a request crafted by the attacker. This could involve social engineering techniques to get the victim to click on a malicious link.
*   The attacker can use a malicious third-party website to modify the session cookie with a crafted payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL or inject the malicious script into a website.
*   The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link or visiting the attacker's website.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be directly authenticated with the `mycloud.com` service. The vulnerability lies in the user's browser session when interacting with the service.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects the cloud service URLs `idp.mycloud.com` and `files.mycloud.com`.
*   The fix is in version 2.2.0-134 of the `mycloud.com` service.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Frantisek Uhrecky.
