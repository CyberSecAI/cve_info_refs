Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of multiple stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Virtual Appliance (IWSVA) web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected into the application and stored. The provided example shows this happening when adding a user with a crafted description that contains an XSS payload. This payload is then executed when the user overview page is loaded.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected through URL parameters and are reflected back to the user. The provided examples show this happening in the `/logon_report.jsp` and `/change_status.jsp` pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they interact with the vulnerable parts of the web interface.
*   Potentially steal user cookies or session tokens.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying settings or adding malicious users.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious code via a vulnerable input field (e.g. user description field). When a user views the page with the stored payload, the injected script executes in their browser.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it. The payload would be reflected back to the user and executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For Stored XSS:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable input fields on the IWSVA web interface to inject malicious code, potentially achieved via CSRF attacks or previously compromised credentials.
*   **For Reflected XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to entice a victim into clicking a crafted link or otherwise navigate to a specific, crafted URL. This could be through social engineering or other means.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory mentions that all the XSS vulnerabilities can be combined with the CSRF Protection Bypass vulnerability, making exploitation easier.
- The advisory notes that a patch was released to fix the vulnerability, and a new "xss\_protect" and "xss\_protect\_all" config values were introduced to enable the XSS filter, with "xss\_protect\_all" being enabled by default.
