Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8020:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the `open-build-service` markdown parser. Specifically, the custom markdown renderer used by open-build-service was not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, which allowed the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent (stored) XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored and executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises from the failure to sanitize user input within the markdown parser, allowing malicious HTML/JavaScript to be embedded in the rendered output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, impersonate the user, and perform actions on the user's behalf.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially steal or modify data accessible to the compromised user, including user credentials, sensitive information etc.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could also alter the appearance of the web page and redirect the victim to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Markdown Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code by embedding it within markdown content.
- **User Interaction:** When a user views the page containing the malicious markdown content, the injected script is executed in their browser, resulting in the execution of the arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Input Markdown Content:** An attacker needs to be able to submit and store markdown content to the vulnerable system. This could be through a variety of entry points such as project descriptions, comments, or documentation fields of the affected `open-build-service`.
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, exploiting the vulnerability through the web interface of the application.

**Additional Details from provided documents:**
- The vulnerability was found in the custom markdown renderer of the `open-build-service` which is implemented in `obsapi/markdown_renderer.rb` and was fixed by basing it on `Redcarpet::Render::Safe` instead of `Redcarpet::Render::HTML`.
- Patches were applied and backported to the affected appliances.
- The fix was committed to the project's GitHub repository.
- A related bug (CVE-2020-8031) was marked as a duplicate, indicating that multiple XSS issues were present.
