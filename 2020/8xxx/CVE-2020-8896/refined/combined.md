Earth version 6.1

**New in Google Earth Pro:**

* Google Earth Pro has improved support for [printing](/earth/answer/148146) from the client. Changes include a legend with a North indicator and scale, controls for print/paper size, and improved performance.
* Google Earth Pro has improved the experience of [making movies](earth/answer/2663887) by simplifying the user interface and improving performance in certain configurations.
* [Importing data files](/earth/answer/176685) in Google Earth Pro is now easier with the ability to edit shared balloon style for folders and to increase the import categorization limit from 8 to 64.
* Google Earth Pro now allows you to view an elevation profile while measuring.

**In Google Earth (Consumer and Pro version):**

* Improved the robustness of network access by providing better support for Proxy and SSL certs. This will fix issues users have experienced of not being able to see balloon content or embedded browser content.
* Improved the resolution seen in elevation profiles for lines and tracks.
* Added the ability to sort “My Places,” and improved the user interface to be able find points across my places.
* There were several improvements to Street View in Google Earth. We added the ability to zoom into a Street View photo by using a zoom slider. Street View in Earth feels more immersive now due to wider field of view. It is now faster and smoother to use. We made several small tweaks to the user interface including adding a way to navigate floors when you are indoors and there are multiple floors available in Street View.
* Fixed bugs related to missing road labels in cases where roads were curvy or zoomed into.

**In Google Earth API for browser plugins:**

* Added API for working with [tours.](/earth/answer/148174)

**Fixed bugs and product changes:**

* To conform more closely with the OGC KML 2.2 standard, we've made the parsing of the <coordinates> tag more strict in version 6.1. Spaces must only be used to separate the (longitude,latitude,altitude) triplets which specify the coordinates of a single point. It is invalid to add spaces between individual coordinates. We understand that previous versions of the client were more lenient, so if your KML files contain spaces beween coordinates in coordinate triplets, an easy workaround is to remove all whitespace located immediately before or after commas inside a <coordinates> tag.
* Several performance improvements that would allow smoother experience in specific computer configurations.
* Fixed 'Restrict to View' functionality during a shapefile import in Google Earth Pro.
* Fixed an issue where Google Earth would sometimes save incorrect ordering of elements in KML.
* Added field of view recording to [tours](/earth/answer/148174) and ability to play back those changes.
* Fixed an issue where the icon heading did not work in Google Earth API.
* Changes to reduce occurrences of missing desktop icon and shortcut menu items on an update.
* Sped up overlay polygon rendering in OpenGL mode.
* Fixed loading of kmz files when the first file at the root level was image file.
* Upgraded GDAL support to 1.7.0 and fixed issues with importing .tab files in Google Earth Pro.
* Fixed the discrepancy caused in measurements due to multiple radii of Earth used inside Google Earth.
* Fixed an issue where placemarks created with UTM coordinates did not move when edited.
* Fixed an issue when screen overlays disappeared in a print-out.

Earth version 6.0.2

**Issues Fixed with Desktop Client:**

* Fixed a problem where we were over fetching certain kml layer data and running into issuing of using large amounts of memory and slowness during zooming in.
* Fixed an issue of ruler tool disappearing. In 6.0 beta, when measuring using the path tool, if you break to add a place-mark then you go back to the path and click "save" the path and ruler tool disappears all together.
* Fixed an issue with incorrectly measuring long distances. Improved navigation in Street View inside buildings.
* Fixed a crash with elevation profile if there was empty gx:value node in KML.
* Optimized amount of terrain and imagery data fetched while viewing photo overlays.
* Fixed an occasional crash while viewing 3D buildings. Fixed broken fly-to links within local kml files.

* **Integrated Street View:** In Google Earth 6, the Street View experience is now fully integrated. You can enter Street View either by dropping pegman in navigation controls or by zooming in all the way to ground level on places that have Street View.
* **3D Trees:**Google Earth now has trees. You can enable trees by turning on the check-box next to the Trees layer under the 3D buildings layer folder. You can see trees in several places, and we will add trees to more places over time.
* **Easy to use historical imagery:**When you fly to an area where historical imagery is available, the date of the oldest imagery will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the screen. If you click on this date, you’ll instantly be taken back in time to view imagery from that time period.
* **Ground-level navigation**: In Google Earth 6, in addition to flying around features, you can now walk on the ground to explore either 3D buildings and trees or Street View imagery.
* **3D Measurements in Google Earth Pro:**In addition to measuring distances and areas on the ground, you can now measure heights and widths of 3D building and distances from buildings to the ground.

#### Other changes in Google Earth 6

* **Tour Recorder Improvements:**With Google Earth 6, the tour recording feature has been improved in several ways. The tour recorder now incorporates the activation of Sunlight, Street View, and Historical Imagery modes into the recorded tour. Additionally, the quality of the recording has been significantly improved, including better motion fidelity and better synchronization with sound recording.
* **Earth on PowerPC Mac:**We are discontinuing support for Google Earth builds that work on PowerPC Macs. Users of PowerPC macs can still use the Google Earth 5.2 version.

Earth version 5.2
**New Features in Google Earth 5.2**

* **Improved embedded browser functionality**: Better integration of embedded browser with Google Earth Application.
* **Track and Multitrack in Google Earth**: A track allows you to create one visible object in Google Earth (either a Point icon or a Model) that moves over time between multiple positions. Using the time slider, you can animate position and orientation of an object and show a line tracing the path. A multitrack is a collection of tracks. You can create Track and Multitrack by authoring KML documents or by importing your GPS data (from a number of GPS receivers or file formats such as GPX) into Google Earth.
* **Elevation Profile in Google Earth**: You can see elevation profile of a line-string or track in Google Earth. It plots the elevation profile, speed, and associated extended data (for example, heart rate) in a KML file.
* **Added file import types**: NMEA (.log and .nmea), Garmin GDB, Garmin Training Center, and Ozi Explorer files can now all be read. Garmin fitness extensions are now read from GPX. Extended data for Elevation Profile and Track is handled when available.

**Known Issues and Workarounds**

In Google Earth Pro, while using movie-making with high resolutions you could run into issues of text and view being distorted in OpenGL mode. We are fixing this issue. If you run into this issue, there are three workarounds

* Use window size such that 3D view is larger than resolution of movie being recorded.
* Use window size such that both vertical and horizontal size of 3D window is smaller than resolution needed.
* If you are using windows platform, you can use DirectX mode.
