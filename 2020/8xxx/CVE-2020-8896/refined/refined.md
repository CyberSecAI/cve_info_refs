Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-8896:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overrun that occurs due to invalid encryption key lengths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Buffer Overrun: The software does not properly validate the length of encryption keys, which can cause a buffer to be overflown, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The impact of this vulnerability is a buffer overrun, which could lead to:
    *   Application crash.
    *   Potential arbitrary code execution (not explicitly stated but implied).

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the handling of encryption keys of invalid lengths within the Google Earth application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need to provide or manipulate encryption keys with invalid lengths to trigger the buffer overflow, likely through some form of crafted data or configuration provided to the Google Earth Pro application.
