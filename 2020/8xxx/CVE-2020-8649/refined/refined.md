Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-8649:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a use-after-free (UAF) in the `vgacon_invert_region` function within the Linux kernel's `vgacon` driver. This happens when the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The vulnerability lies in accessing a memory region (`p`) after it has been freed. Specifically, the line `u16 a = scr_readw(p);` within the `vgacon_invert_region` function attempts to read from the memory region pointed to by `p`, which might have been deallocated already, hence the use-after-free.
- The code uses `vga_vram_base` for `vc_origin` and `vc_visible_origin` and not `vc_screenbuf` when calling `set_origin` which is smaller than `vc_screenbuf` . This could lead to a situation where, during a resize operation, the calculated offset based on the new size can become larger than `vga_vram_size`. This difference between the sizes leads to out-of-bounds access when the driver reads or writes to the video memory.
- There is a similar issue during a resize operation when copying the old origin to the new origin. If a larger `screenbuf` is set and then a much larger `screenbuf` is set, the copy operation could trigger a bad memory access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this UAF can lead to a kernel crash or memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** In some cases, memory corruption vulnerabilities can be exploited to escalate privileges, though it's not explicitly stated in all sources whether this is a high probability for this CVE.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to a virtual terminal (e.g., `/dev/tty1`) on a system using the affected `vgacon` driver.
- **Malicious Configuration:** The `screenbuf` may be manipulated to cause a bad memory access, typically involving setting an initial large `screenbuf` then resizing with a bigger `screenbuf`. 
- **Specific IOCTL:** A specific IOCTL call (`TIOCLINUX`) is involved in triggering the UAF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
- **Virtual Terminal Access:** The attacker needs access to a virtual terminal device (e.g., `/dev/tty1`) to interact with the `vgacon` driver.
- **Screen Resizing (Potentially):** The exploit often involves resizing the screen through operations which may include ioctl calls.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is also mentioned to be related to CVE-2020-8647.
-   The provided patch checks if the screen size exceeds `vga_vram`, which leads to a failure of the resize operation. This additional check is intended to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited in the first place, preventing the use-after-free and bad access scenarios.
-   Some sources also mention that Linus Torvalds pointed out that overflow checking seemed absent. The issue seems to be somewhat mitigated by existing bounds checks with strict limits in `vc_do_resize()`.
-   The fix in the kernel also covers CVE-2020-8647, so it is a multi-fix patch.
-   The vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `screenbuf`, and resizing the screen through the driver.

In summary, CVE-2020-8649 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the `vgacon` driver that can be triggered by a local user who can access a virtual terminal. The fix involves adding a check for if the screen size exceeds the `vga_vram` size and failing the resize if the check fails, preventing out-of-bounds access, and the use-after-free.
