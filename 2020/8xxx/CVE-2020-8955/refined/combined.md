# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

##### Description

An integer overflow can happen when looping over items in a list.

This can only happen in rare conditions on 32 and 64-bit systems, as the list must contain more than 2,147,483,647 elements.

On 16-bit systems, this happens with a list that contains more than 32,767 elements.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

The upgrade to the latest stable version is highly recommended.
##### Credit

The issue was discovered by Yiheng Cao.

[Commit](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/commit/710247891cdfd4e66ee6d1715e93626def6871f1)

##### Description

After changing the options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, the TLS verification function is lost.

Consequently, any connection to a server with TLS is made without verifying the certificate, which could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack.

Connection to IRC servers with TLS is affected, as well as any connection a server made by a plugin or a script using the function hook\_connect.
##### Mitigation

After changing options `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system` or `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user`, you must restart WeeChat.

##### Description

A crash happens when decoding a malformed websocket frame in relay plugin.

This happens even if a password is set in relay plugin, the malformed websocket frame can be received before the authentication of the client.
##### Mitigation

There are multiple ways to mitigate this issue:

* Rremove all relays, see: `/help relay`
* Unload relay plugin with command: `/plugin unload relay` and see: `/help weechat.plugin.autoload`
* Secure relay to allow only some trusted IP addresses, see: `/help relay.network.allowed_ips`

##### Description

A buffer overflow happens when a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes.

Note: a "normal" IRC server should not send again a message 005 with new nick prefixes, so the problem should be limited to malicious IRC servers.
##### Mitigation

There is no known mitigation.

The upgrade to the latest stable version is highly recommended.
##### Credit

The issue was discovered by Stuart Nevans Locke.

##### Description

Crash when receiving a malformed IRC message 352 (WHO).
##### Mitigation

With WeeChat ≥ 1.1, you can create a trigger:

```
/trigger add fix_irc_352 modifier "irc_in_352" "${arguments} =~ .* \*$" "/.*//"
```

With any older version, there is no simple mitigation, you must upgrade WeeChat.

##### Description

Date/time conversion specifiers are expanded after replacing buffer local variables in name of log files. In some cases, this can lead to an error in function strftime and a crash caused by the use of an uninitialized buffer.
##### Mitigation

You can unload the logger plugin, thus stopping recording of all buffers: `/plugin unload logger`.

[ChangeLog](https://weechat.org/files/changelog/ChangeLog-devel.html)
(file *ChangeLog.adoc* in sources).

## Version 2.7.1 (2020-02-20)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 2.7 (2019-12-08)

### CMake errors on missing dependencies

When compiling WeeChat with CMake (which is the recommended way), errors are
now displayed on any missing dependency, if the optional feature was enabled
(most features are automatically enabled, except documentation, man page and
tests).

Any error on a missing dependency is fatal, so WeeChat can not be compiled.
This is a new behavior compared to old versions, where any missing dependency
was silently ignored and the compilation was possible anyway.

For example if PHP is not installed on your system, CMake will display an error
on missing PHP library:

```
-- checking for one of the modules 'php7'
CMake Warning at cmake/FindPHP.cmake:57 (message):
  Could not find libphp7.  Ensure PHP >=7.0.0 development libraries are
  installed and compiled with `--enable-embed`.  Ensure `php-config` is in
  `PATH`.  You may set `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=...` to the directory containing
  libphp7.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  src/plugins/CMakeLists.txt:157 (find_package)

CMake Error at src/plugins/CMakeLists.txt:161 (message):
  Php not found
```

Then you can either install PHP or explicitly disable PHP if you don’t need this
plugin, using this cmake option:

```
cmake .. -DENABLE_PHP=OFF
```

### Strings received in Python 3 callbacks

The strings sent to script callbacks in Python 3 are now automatically converted
according to the content:

* if the string is valid UTF-8, it is sent as `str` (legacy behavior)
* if the string is not valid UTF-8, it is sent as `bytes` (new).

In some cases only, the string may not be valid UTF-8, so it is received as
`bytes` in the callback, which must take care of that.

For more information, see the WeeChat scripting guide: chapter about strings
received in callbacks (see also [issue #1389](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/1389)).

Note: there are no changes for Python 2 (which is now deprecated and should not
be used any more), the strings sent to callbacks are always of type `str`, and
may contain invalid UTF-8 data, in the cases mentioned in the WeeChat scripting
guide.

### IRC message decoding/encoding

A new server option called "charset\_message" has been added, replacing the
option *irc.network.channel\_encode*.

This new server option has three possible values:

* *message* (default): the whole IRC message is decoded/encoded, this is the
  new default behavior; in case of problem with channel names, try to use
  *text* instead
* *channel*: the message is decoded/encoded starting at the channel name (or
  the text if no channel is present); this is like setting the old option
  *irc.network.channel\_encode* to *on*
* *text*: the message is decoded/encoded starting from the text (for example
  the user message); this is like setting the old option
  *irc.network.channel\_encode* to *off* (so this was the default behavior
  in previous versions)

### Suffix for files received via DCC

Files received via DCC (xfer plugin) now have a suffix ".part" during the
transfer. When the transfer is successful, the suffix is removed.

This suffix can be customized with the new option
*xfer.file.download\_temporary\_suffix*.

If you prefer the legacy behavior (no suffix added), you can set an empty value
in the new option:

```
/set xfer.file.download_temporary_suffix ""
```

## Version 2.6 (2019-09-08)

### Python 3 by default

Python 3 is now used by default to compile the "python" plugin (no fallback
on Python 2).

The CMake option `ENABLE_PYTHON3` has been renamed to `ENABLE_PYTHON2`
(configure option `--enable-python2`). If this option is enabled, the "python"
plugin is built with Python 2 (no fallback on Python 3).

### Nick colors

The function to compute the colors based on the nick letters has been fixed
(now the function uses only a 64-bit integer even if the underlying architecture
is 32-bit).

If you’re running WeeChat on a 32-bit architecture and want to keep same colors
as the previous releases, you can use one of the two new hash values.

If you were using "djb2", you can switch to "djb2\_32":

```
/set weechat.look.nick_color_hash djb2_32
```

If you were using "sum", you can switch to "sum\_32":

```
/set weechat.look.nick_color_hash sum_32
```

## Version 2.5 (2019-06-06)

### Aspell plugin renamed to Spell

The "aspell" plugin has been renamed to "spell", a more generic term, because
it supports aspell and also enchant.

Consequently, the following things have been renamed as well:

* file *aspell.conf* renamed to *spell.conf*; the content of the
  file has not changed, so you can just rename the file to keep your changes
* options *aspell.\** renamed to *spell.\**
* command `/aspell` renamed to `/spell`
* default key `Alt`+`s` changed to `/mute spell toggle`
* bar item *aspell\_dict* renamed to *spell\_dict*
* bar item *aspell\_suggest* renamed to *spell\_suggest*
* info *aspell\_dict* renamed to *spell\_dict*

If you are upgrading from a previous release, you can copy the config file
before doing `/upgrade`, in WeeChat:

```
/save aspell
/exec -sh cp ~/.weechat/aspell.conf ~/.weechat/spell.conf
/upgrade
```

If you already upgraded WeeChat:

```
/exec -sh cp ~/.weechat/aspell.conf ~/.weechat/spell.conf
/reload spell
```

Once configuration is OK, you can delete the file *~/.weechat/aspell.conf*.

Then you can search if you are using "aspell" in values of options:

```
/fset =aspell
```

If there are options displayed, replace "aspell" by "spell" in values.

The default key `Alt`+`s` can be changed to the new `/spell` command:

```
/key bind meta-s /mute spell toggle
```

### Speed limit option for DCC files

The option *xfer.network.speed\_limit* has been renamed to
*xfer.network.speed\_limit\_send*.

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

A new option *xfer.network.speed\_limit\_recv* has been added to limit the
speed of received files.

### Allocated string in hook info and function info\_get

The hook info callback now returns an allocated string, which must be freed
after use (in previous versions, a pointer to a static string was returned).

Consequently, the function info\_get returns an allocated string, which must
be freed after use.

This affects only C code, no changes are required in scripts.

## Version 2.4 (2019-02-17)

### Nick completer

A space is not added automatically any more when you complete a nick at the
beginning of command line.

Purpose of this change is to be more flexible: you can choose whether the space
is added or not (it was always added in previous releases).

The default value of option `weechat.completion.nick_completer` has been changed
to add the space by default, but the value of option is not changed automatically
on upgrade.

So you can run this command if you upgraded from an old version
and want the space still added automatically:

```
/set weechat.completion.nick_completer ": "
```

### Base64 API functions

The functions to encode/decode base64 strings have been renamed and now support
base 16, 32, and 64.

New functions in C API, supporting base 16, 32, and 64:

* string\_base\_encode
* string\_base\_decode

Functions removed from C API:

* string\_encode\_base64
* string\_decode\_base64

## Version 2.3 (2018-10-21)

No release note.

## Version 2.2 (2018-07-14)

### Default conditions for hotlist

The default value for option `weechat.look.hotlist_add_conditions` has been
changed to take care about the number of connected clients on the relay
with weechat protocol: if at least one client is connected, the buffer is
always added to the hotlist.

The new value contains three conditions, if one of them is true, the buffer
is added to the hotlist:

* `${away}`: true if you are away on the server matching the buffer,
* `${buffer.num_displayed} == 0`: true if the buffer is not displayed in any
  window
* `${info:relay_client_count,weechat,connected} > 0`: true if at least
  one client is connected on a weechat relay (new condition).

To use the new default value, you can reset the option with this command:

```
/unset weechat.look.hotlist_add_conditions
```

Or set explicitly the value:

```
/set weechat.look.hotlist_add_conditions "${away} || ${buffer.num_displayed} == 0 || ${info:relay_client_count,weechat,connected} > 0"
```

### Default triggers

The existing triggers "cmd\_pass" and "msg\_auth" have been updated to hide
password in command `/msg nickserv set password` and support the option
`-server xxx`.

You can restore the default triggers with the following command:

```
/trigger restore cmd_pass msg_auth
```

### Tags in IRC "in" signals

The IRCv3 tags are now sent in these IRC signals for received messages
(*xxx* is IRC server name, *yyy* is IRC command name):

* *xxx,irc\_in\_yyy*
* *xxx,irc\_in2\_yyy*
* *xxx,irc\_raw\_in\_yyy*
* *xxx,irc\_raw\_in2\_yyy*

This could break plugins or scripts that parse IRC messages and don’t expect
to receive tags (even if tags **are** part of the IRC message, so this was a bug
in the IRC signals).

See [issue #787](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/787) for more information.

| Note | It is recommended for plugins and scripts to use the WeeChat IRC parser: see the function "info\_get\_hashtable" in the Plugin API reference. |
| --- | --- |

Now the whole IRC message is received by the signal callback, for example:

```
@tag1=abc;tag2=def :nick!user@host PRIVMSG #test :this is a test
```

In older releases, this message was received:

```
:nick!user@host PRIVMSG #test :this is a test
```

### New Debian package for headless version

A new Debian package has been added: *weechat-headless* which contains the
binary *weechat-headless* and its man page.

In version 2.1, this binary was in the package *weechat-curses*.

## Version 2.1 (2018-03-18)

### Completion for /set and /help commands

A new option weechat.completion.partial\_completion\_templates has been added to
force partial completion on some templates. By default, the option name
completed in `/set` and `/help` commands are now using partial completion.

If you prefer old behavior, you can remove the templates from the new option
with this command:

```
/set weechat.completion.partial_completion_templates ""
```

For more information about this feature, you can read help with:

```
/help weechat.completion.partial_completion_templates
```

### Option to check license of scripts loaded

A configuration file has been added for each script plugin: *python.conf*,
*perl.conf*, *ruby.conf*, …​

Therefore the option to check license of loaded scripts has been moved from
*plugins.var.<language>.check\_license* (type: string) to the plugin
configuration file (type: boolean, default is *off*).

List of options moved:

* *plugins.var.python.check\_license* (string) moved to *python.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.perl.check\_license* (string) moved to *perl.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.ruby.check\_license* (string) moved to *ruby.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.lua.check\_license* (string) moved to *lua.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.tcl.check\_license* (string) moved to *tcl.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.guile.check\_license* (string) moved to *guile.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.javascript.check\_license* (string) moved to *javascript.look.check\_license* (boolean)
* *plugins.var.php.check\_license* (string) moved to *php.look.check\_license* (boolean)

## Version 2.0.1 (2017-12-20)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 2.0 (2017-12-03)

### Fset plugin

A new plugin "fset" has been added, it replaces the script iset.pl and has many
new features.

By default the fset plugin changes the behavior of `/set` command when it is
used with only an option name: it opens the fset buffer if at least one option
is found.

The old behavior was to display the list of options in the core buffer.

If you prefer the old behavior, you can restore it with this command:

```
/set fset.look.condition_catch_set ""
```

For more information about this feature, you can read help with:

```
/help fset.look.condition_catch_set
```

### Split of scripting Debian packages

The Debian packaging has changed (for now only on weechat.org repositories,
not in Debian official repositories).

The package *weechat-plugins* has been split into 9 packages:

* weechat-plugins (with only the following plugins: aspell, exec, fifo, relay,
  script, trigger)
* weechat-python
* weechat-perl
* weechat-ruby
* weechat-lua
* weechat-tcl
* weechat-guile
* weechat-javascript
* weechat-php.

If you are using the packages from weechat.org, you will have to install
manually the scripting packages (according to the languages you’ll use
in WeeChat), for example Python/Perl only:

```
sudo apt-get install weechat-python weechat-perl
```

For development packages:

```
sudo apt-get install weechat-devel-python weechat-devel-perl
```

### Evaluation in buflist

The evaluation of expressions in buflist options is not recursive any more,
to prevent too many evaluations, for example in buffer variables
(see [issue #1060](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/1060) for more information).

If you are using custom variables/options containing evaluated expressions,
like `${some.config.option}`, and if this option contains evaluated strings (`${…​}`),
you must evaluate them with: `${eval:${some.config.option}}`.

| Note | The default buflist formats (`${format_buffer}`, `${format_name}`, `${format_hotlist}`, …​) are automatically evaluated in options *buflist.format.buffer*, *buflist.format.buffer\_current* and *buflist.format.hotlist*. |
| --- | --- |

### Function hook\_connect

In scripts, the arguments *status*, *gnutls\_rc* and *sock* sent to the callback
of *hook\_connect* are now integers (they were strings in older releases).

To be compatible with all versions, it is recommended to convert the argument
to integer before using it, for example in Python: `int(sock)`.

### Function hook\_fd

In scripts, the argument *fd* sent to the callback of *hook\_fd* is now
an integer (it was a string in older releases).

To be compatible with all versions, it is recommended to convert the argument
to integer before using it, for example in Python: `int(fd)`.

## Version 1.9.1 (2017-09-23)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 1.9 (2017-06-25)

No release note.

## Version 1.8 (2017-05-13)

### Buflist plugin

A new plugin called "buflist" has been added, it replaces the script "buffers.pl".

If the script is installed, you will see two sidebars with list of buffers.

If you fell in love with buflist and that the script buffers.pl is installed,
you can uninstall the script and remove its bar with these commands:

```
/script remove buffers.pl
/bar del buffers
```

If you don’t want the list of buffers, you can disable buflist:

```
/set buflist.look.enabled off
```

To save extra memory, you can even unload the buflist plugin, remove the bar and
prevent the plugin from loading on next startup:

```
/plugin unload buflist
/bar del buflist
/set weechat.plugin.autoload "*,!buflist"
```

### Options

The option *script.scripts.url\_force\_https* has been removed because now the
site weechat.org can only be used with HTTPS.

Both HTTP and HTTPS protocols are allowed in the option *script.scripts.url*.
For <http://weechat.org/> an automatic redirection to <https://weechat.org/> will
occur, so you should check that the CA certificates are properly installed
on your machine.

Aspell option with color for suggestion on a misspelled word has been renamed:

* *aspell.color.suggestions* has been renamed to *aspell.color.suggestion*

## Version 1.7.1 (2017-04-22)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 1.7 (2017-01-15)

### FIFO options

A new configuration file "fifo.conf" has been added and the old option
*plugins.var.fifo.fifo* has been moved to *fifo.file.enabled*.

A new option *fifo.file.path* can be used to customize the FIFO pipe
path/filename.

### Default triggers

A new trigger "cmd\_pass\_register" has been added to hide only password and not
email in command `/msg nickserv register password email`.

The existing trigger "cmd\_pass" has been updated to hide password in all
commands except `/msg nickserv register`.

You can add the new trigger and restore the other one with the following
command:

```
/trigger restore cmd_pass_register cmd_pass
```

## Version 1.6 (2016-10-02)

### IRC kick/part/quit default messages

Server options with default messages for kick/part/quit have been renamed:

* options by default for all servers:

  + *irc.server\_default.default\_msg\_kick* has been renamed to *irc.server\_default.msg\_kick*
  + *irc.server\_default.default\_msg\_part* has been renamed to *irc.server\_default.msg\_part*
  + *irc.server\_default.default\_msg\_quit* has been renamed to *irc.server\_default.msg\_quit*
* options in each server:

  + *irc.server.xxx.default\_msg\_kick* has been renamed to *irc.server.xxx.msg\_kick*
  + *irc.server.xxx.default\_msg\_part* has been renamed to *irc.server.xxx.msg\_part*
  + *irc.server.xxx.default\_msg\_quit* has been renamed to *irc.server.xxx.msg\_quit*

If you changed the value of these options, you must set them again after upgrade.

### Printf API functions

Some "printf" functions have been removed from C API (there were not in scripting API):

* printf\_date
* printf\_tags

The function "printf\_date\_tags" must now be used instead of these functions
(the two functions removed were just C macros on function "printf\_date\_tags"
with tags set to NULL for "printf\_date" and date set to 0 for "printf\_tags").

## Version 1.5 (2016-05-01)

### Nick coloring moved to core

The nick coloring feature has been moved from irc plugin to core.

Two options have been moved from irc plugin (irc.conf) to core (weechat.conf),
and you must set new value if you customized them:

* *irc.look.nick\_color\_force* moved to *weechat.look.nick\_color\_force*
* *irc.look.nick\_color\_hash* moved to *weechat.look.nick\_color\_hash*
* *irc.look.nick\_color\_stop\_chars* moved to *weechat.look.nick\_color\_stop\_chars*

The default value for option *weechat.look.nick\_color\_hash* is now `djb2`
instead of `sum`.

The following info names (used by API function "info\_get") are renamed as well:

* *irc\_nick\_color* renamed to *nick\_color*
* *irc\_nick\_color\_name* renamed to *nick\_color\_name*

| Note | The old info *irc\_nick\_color* and *irc\_nick\_color\_name* are kept for compatibility (especially scripts) and will be removed in an upcoming release. |
| --- | --- |

### Pointer in callbacks

A pointer has been added in all callbacks used by scripts, so the callbacks
will receive an extra *const void \*pointer* before the *void \*data*
(in the C API only, not scripting API).

This is used to remove linked list of callbacks in scrips (improve speed,
reduce memory usage).

Following functions are changed in the C API:

* exec\_on\_files
* config\_new
* config\_new\_section
* config\_new\_option
* hook\_command
* hook\_command\_run
* hook\_timer
* hook\_fd
* hook\_process
* hook\_process\_hashtable
* hook\_connect
* hook\_print
* hook\_signal
* hook\_hsignal
* hook\_config
* hook\_completion
* hook\_modifier
* hook\_info
* hook\_info\_hashtable
* hook\_infolist
* hook\_hdata
* hook\_focus
* unhook\_all
* buffer\_new
* bar\_item\_new
* upgrade\_new
* upgrade\_read

The function `unhook_all` has a new argument `const char *subplugin` to remove
only hooks created by this "subplugin" (script).

### Bar item "away"

The bar item "away" has been moved from irc plugin to core (so that away status
can be displayed for any plugin, using the buffer local variable "away").

Two options have been moved from irc plugin (irc.conf) to core (weechat.conf):

* *irc.look.item\_away\_message* moved to *weechat.look.item\_away\_message*
* *irc.color.item\_away* moved to *weechat.color.item\_away*

### Default triggers

The default triggers "cmd\_pass" and "msg\_auth" have been updated to include
nickserv commands "recover" and "regain".

You can restore them with the following command:

```
/trigger restore cmd_pass msg_auth
```

## Version 1.4 (2016-01-10)

### IRC alternate nicks

The option *irc.network.alternate\_nick* has been moved into servers
(*irc.server\_default.nicks\_alternate* and *irc.server.xxx.nicks\_alternate*).

If you disabled this option, you must switch it off again, globally or by
server.

Globally (default value for all servers):

```
/set irc.server_default.nicks_alternate off
```

For a specific server:

```
/set irc.server.freenode.nicks_alternate off
```

## Version 1.3 (2015-08-16)

### IRC channels encoding

If you are using exotic charsets in your channel names (anything different from
UTF-8, like ISO charset), you should turn on a new option:

```
/set irc.network.channel_encode on
```

This will force WeeChat to decode/encode the channel name
(like WeeChat 1.2 or older did).

See these issues for more information: [issue #482](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/482), [issue #218](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/218).

| Note | It is **highly recommended** to use only UTF-8 in WeeChat (wherever you can), because everything is stored as UTF-8 internally. |
| --- | --- |

### Alias command

The command `/alias` has been updated to list, add and remove aliases.
Therefore the command `/unalias` has been removed.

To add an alias, the argument `add` must be used in command `/alias` before the
name, for example:

```
/alias add split /window splith
```

And the alias is removed with this command:

```
/alias del split
```

### Script path

The option *script.scripts.dir* has been renamed to *script.scripts.path*
(and the content is now evaluated, see `/help eval`).

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

## Version 1.2 (2015-05-10)

The word chars are now customizable with two options:

* weechat.look.word\_chars\_highlight
* weechat.look.word\_chars\_input

The behavior has changed for command line: now any non-word char is used as
delimiter for keys to move to previous/next word or delete previous/next word.

You can restore the old behavior (only use spaces as delimiters) with this
command:

```
/set weechat.look.word_chars_input "!\u00A0,!\x20,*"
```

## Version 1.1.1 (2015-01-25)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 1.1 (2015-01-11)

### New format for regex replacement in triggers

A new format is used in regex replacement to use regex groups, this format
is incompatible with version 1.0.

The existing triggers are **NOT automatically updated**.

| Old format | New format | Examples (new format) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$0` …​ `$99` | `${re:0}` …​ `${re:99}` | `${re:1}` |
| `$+` | `${re:+}` | `${re:+}` |
| `$.*N` | `${hide:*,${re:N}}` | `${hide:*,${re:2}}` `${hide:-,${re:+}}` |

Moreover, default triggers used to hide passwords have been fixed for \*BSD
operating systems.

You can restore them with the following command:

```
/trigger restore cmd_pass msg_auth server_pass
```

If you added triggers with the old regex replacement format, you must update
them manually.

### Default "beep" trigger

The command of "beep" trigger is now executed only if the message is displayed
(not filtered with /filter).

You can restore the default "beep" trigger with the following command:

```
/trigger restore beep
```

### Return code of commands

The API function *weechat\_command* now sends the value returned return by
command callback.

WeeChat does not display any more an error when a command returns
*WEECHAT\_RC\_ERROR*. Consequently, all plugins/scripts should display an
explicit error message before returning *WEECHAT\_RC\_ERROR*.

For C plugins, two macros have been added in weechat-plugin.h:
*WEECHAT\_COMMAND\_MIN\_ARGS* and *WEECHAT\_COMMAND\_ERROR*.

### Completion of inline commands

WeeChat now completes by default inline commands (not only at beginning of
line).

When this feature is enabled, there is no more automatic completion of
absolute paths (except if you are completing a path inside a command argument,
like `/dcc send <nick> <path>`).

To restore the old behavior (no completion of inline commands):

```
/set weechat.completion.command_inline off
```

### Relay option relay.irc.backlog\_tags

The option *relay.irc.backlog\_tags* is now a list separated by commas
(it was separated by semicolons in older versions).

If you are using a list of tags in this option, you must adjust the value
manually.

### IPv4-mapped IPv6 client address in relay

The string "::ffff:" has been removed from IPv4-mapped IPv6 client address
in relay plugin.

If you are using "::ffff:" in option *relay.network.allowed\_ips*, you can
remove it.

### Temporary servers disabled by default with /connect

Creating a temporary server with command `/connect <address>` or
`/connect irc://...` is now forbidden by default.

A new option has been added to unlock the feature, you can do that for
the old behavior in command `/connect`:

```
/set irc.look.temporary_servers on
```

### Microseconds in API timeval functions

The API functions using timeval are now using or returning microseconds,
instead of milliseconds:

* function *util\_timeval\_diff*: returns microseconds
* function *util\_timeval\_add*: the argument *interval* is now expressed in
  microseconds.

## Version 1.0.1 (2014-09-28)

Bug fix and maintenance release.

## Version 1.0 (2014-08-15)

### Channel type not added by default on /join

The channel type is not any more automatically added to a channel name on join
(for example `/join weechat` will not send `/join #weechat`).

If you are lazy and want to automatically add the channel type, you can turn on
the new option:

```
/set irc.look.join_auto_add_chantype on
```

### Hide IRC channel modes arguments

The option *irc.look.item\_channel\_modes\_hide\_key* has been renamed to
*irc.look.item\_channel\_modes\_hide\_args* and is now a string.

It can now hide arguments for multiple channel modes.

By default, a channel key (mode "k") will hide channel arguments. For old
behavior (never hide arguments, even with a channel key), you can do:

```
/set irc.look.item_channel_modes_hide_args ""
```

### Jump to first/last buffer

The command `/input jump_last_buffer` has been replaced by `/buffer +`.
You can rebind the key `Alt`+`j`, `Alt`+`l` (`L`):

```
/key bind meta-jmeta-l /buffer +
```

| Note | The command `/input jump_last_buffer` still works for compatibility reasons, but it should not be used any more. |
| --- | --- |

Similarly, a new key has been added to jump to first buffer: `Alt`+`j`, `Alt`+`f`.
You can add it with following command:

```
/key missing
```

### Hotlist conditions

A new option *weechat.look.hotlist\_add\_conditions* has been added. This option
replaces the option *weechat.look.hotlist\_add\_buffer\_if\_away*, which has been
removed.

Default conditions are `${away} || ${buffer.num_displayed} == 0`, which means
that a buffer is added in hotlist if you are away ("away" local variable is
set), or if the buffer is not visible on screen (not displayed in any window).

If you have set *weechat.look.hotlist\_add\_buffer\_if\_away* to `off` (to not add
current buffer in hotlist when you are away), then you must manually change the
default conditions with the following command:

```
/set weechat.look.hotlist_add_conditions "${buffer.num_displayed} == 0"
```

### Rmodifier replaced by Trigger plugin

The trigger plugin replaces the rmodifier plugin, which has been removed
(and trigger has much more features than rmodifier).

Default triggers have same features as default rmodifiers (to hide passwords
in commands and output).

If you added some custom rmodifiers, you must create similar triggers, see
`/help trigger` and the complete trigger doc in the *WeeChat User’s guide*.

| Note | If on startup you have an error about API mismatch in plugin *rmodifier.so*, you can manually remove the file (the command `make install` does not remove obsolete plugins). |
| --- | --- |

### Bare display

A bare display mode has been added (for easy text selection and click on URLs),
the new default key is `Alt`+`l` (`L`).

Use command `/key missing` to add the key or `/key listdiff` to see differences
between your current keys and WeeChat default keys.

### Function hook\_print

In scripts, the arguments *displayed* and *highlight* sent to the callback of
*hook\_print* are now integers (they were strings in older releases).

To be compatible with all versions, it is recommended to convert the argument
to integer before testing it, for example in Python: `if int(highlight):`.

## Version 0.4.3 (2014-02-09)

### Colors in messages

The color code for "reverse video" in IRC message has been fixed: now WeeChat
uses 0x16 like other clients (and not 0x12 any more).

The code 0x12 is not decoded any more, so if it is received (for example from
an old WeeChat version), it is not displayed as reverse video.

The color code for "underlined text" in input line has been fixed: now WeeChat
uses 0x1F, the same code sent to IRC server.

The default keys for "reverse video" and "underlined text" have changed:

* reverse video: key `Ctrl`+`c`, `r` is replaced by `Ctrl`+`c`, `v`
* underlined text: key `Ctrl`+`c`, `u` is replaced by `Ctrl`+`c`, `_`

You can remove the old keys and add the new ones with these commands:

```
/key unbind ctrl-Cr
/key unbind ctrl-Cu
/key missing
```

### Terminal title

The boolean option *weechat.look.set\_title* has been renamed to
*weechat.look.window\_title* and is now a string.

The content is evaluated and the default value is `WeeChat ${info:version}`.

| Note | Only static content should be used in this option, because the title is refreshed only when the option is changed. |
| --- | --- |

### New bar item buffer\_last\_number

The bar item *buffer\_count* now displays the number of opened buffers (each
merged buffer counts 1).

The new bar item *buffer\_last\_number* displays the highest buffer number
currently used.

If you want to display last number in the status bar, replace *buffer\_count*
by *buffer\_last\_number* in your option *weechat.bar.status.items*.

### New bar item buffer\_zoom

A new bar item has been added: *buffer\_zoom*.
The default value for status bar items becomes:

```
/set weechat.bar.status.items "[time],[buffer_count],[buffer_plugin],buffer_number+:+buffer_name+(buffer_modes)+{buffer_nicklist_count}+buffer_zoom+buffer_filter,[lag],[hotlist],completion,scroll"
```

### IRC messages on channel join

The names are not displayed any more by default on channel join (they are in
nicklist anyway).

Names can be displayed with the value "353" in option
*irc.look.display\_join\_message* (which is not in default value).

The value "366" shows only names count on channel.

If you want to display all messages on join (including names), you can do:

```
/set irc.look.display_join_message "329,332,333,353,366"
```

### Maximum lag in IRC

Option *irc.network.lag\_max* has been added.

The value of option *irc.network.lag\_reconnect* (if set to non-zero value) must
be less than or equal to *irc.network.lag\_max*, otherwise the reconnection will
never occur.

You should check the value of both options and fix them if needed.

## Version 0.4.2 (2013-10-06)

### Day change message

The day change message is now dynamically displayed, and therefore is not stored
as a line in buffer any more.

Option *weechat.look.day\_change\_time\_format* has been split into two options
*weechat.look.day\_change\_message*{1date|2dates}\_ (color codes are allowed in
these options, see `/help eval`).

New color option *weechat.color.chat\_day\_change* has been added.

After `/upgrade` from an old version, you will see two messages for each day
change. This is a normal behavior and will not happen again with the next day
changes.

### Regex search in buffer

Search with regular expression has been added, and therefore some keys in search
context have been changed.

The key `Ctrl`+`r` in search context is now used to switch string/regex search
(instead of searching exact text).

If you never changed keys in search context, you can reset them all with one
command:

```
/key resetall -yes search
```

Or the manual method:

```
/key missing search
/key bindctxt search ctrl-R /input search_switch_regex
```

To view keys in search context:

```
/key list search
```

For more information, see the chapter about keys in the *WeeChat User’s guide*.

### New rmodifier

A new rmodifier "secure" has been added to hide passphrase and passwords
displayed by command `/secure`. Use command `/rmodifier missing` to add it.

### Color codes in options

The format for color codes in some options has changed. The options are
evaluated with the function "string\_eval\_expression", which uses the format
`${color:xxx}`.

Following options are affected:

* *weechat.look.buffer\_time\_format*
* *weechat.look.prefix\_action*
* *weechat.look.prefix\_error*
* *weechat.look.prefix\_join*
* *weechat.look.prefix\_network*
* *weechat.look.prefix\_quit*

The options using old format `${xxx}` must be changed with new format
`${color:xxx}` (where xxx is a color name or number, with optional color
attributes).

Example:

```
/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "${color:251}%H${color:243}%M${color:238}%S"
```

### Binary and man page

WeeChat binary and man page have been renamed from `weechat-curses` to
`weechat`.

A symbolic link has been added for binary: `weechat-curses` → `weechat`
(so that the /upgrade from a old version will still work).

If you upgrade from an old version, it is recommended to force the use of the
new binary name with the command: `/upgrade /path/to/weechat` (replace the path
accordingly).

| Note | For packagers: you should create the link `weechat-curses` → `weechat` if it’s not automatically created in the package (both CMake and configure are creating this link on make install). |
| --- | --- |

### Man page / documentation

Documentation is not built by default any more, you have to use option
`-DENABLE_DOC=ON` in cmake command to enable it.

The man page is now built with asciidoc and translated in several
languages. A new CMake option `ENABLE_MAN` has been added to compile man page
(`OFF` by default).

### Aspell colors

Option *aspell.look.color* has been renamed to *aspell.color.misspelled*.

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

## Version 0.4.1 (2013-05-20)

### Nicklist diff in relay

A new message with identifier "\_nicklist\_diff" has been added in relay (WeeChat
protocol). WeeChat may decide to send full nicklist or this nicklist diff at
any time (depending on size of message, the smaller is sent).

Clients using nicklist must implement it.

For more info about content of message, see document *WeeChat Relay Protocol*.

### Dynamic nick prefix/suffix

The nick prefix/suffix (for example: "<" and ">") are now dynamic and used on
display (not stored any more in the line).

Options moved from irc plugin (irc.conf) to core (weechat.conf):

* *irc.look.nick\_prefix* moved to *weechat.look.nick\_prefix*
* *irc.look.nick\_suffix* moved to *weechat.look.nick\_suffix*
* *irc.color.nick\_prefix* moved to *weechat.color.chat\_nick\_prefix*
* *irc.color.nick\_suffix* moved to *weechat.color.chat\_nick\_suffix*

Types and default values for these four options remain unchanged.

Two new options to customize the truncature char (by default “+”):

* *weechat.look.prefix\_align\_more\_after* (boolean, *on* by default)
* *weechat.look.prefix\_buffer\_align\_more\_after* (boolean, *on* by default)

When these options are enabled (default), the “+” is displayed after the
text, replacing the space that should be displayed there.

When turned off, the “+” will replace last char of text.

Example for a nicks "FlashCode" and "fc" with different values for options
*weechat.look.prefix\_align\_max*, *weechat.look.prefix\_align\_more\_after*,
*weechat.look.nick\_prefix* and *weechat.look.nick\_suffix*:

```
                      # align_max, more_after, prefix/suffix

FlashCode â test      # 0, on
       fc â test

FlashCod+â test       # 8, on
      fc â test

FlashCo+ â test       # 8, off
      fc â test

<FlashCode> â test    # 0, on,  < >
       <fc> â test

<FlashC>+â test       # 8, on,  < >
    <fc> â test

<Flash+> â test       # 8, off, < >
    <fc> â test
```

After `/upgrade`, if you set new options to non-empty strings, and if old
options were set to non-empty strings too, you will see double prefix/suffix
on old messages, this is normal behavior (lines displayed before `/upgrade`
have prefix/suffix saved in prefix, but new lines don’t have them any more).

New options in logger plugin (logger.conf):

* *logger.file.nick\_prefix*: prefix for nicks in log files (default: empty
  string)
* *logger.file.nick\_suffix*: suffix for nicks in log files (default: empty
  string)

### IRC reconnection on important lag

Option *irc.network.lag\_disconnect* has been renamed to
*irc.network.lag\_reconnect* and value is now a number of seconds (instead of
minutes).

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

### IRC passwords hidden

IRC plugin is now using modifiers "irc\_command\_auth" and "irc\_message\_auth" to
hide passwords.

The option *irc.look.hide\_nickserv\_pwd* has been removed, and a new option
*irc.look.nicks\_hide\_password* has been added (by default passwords are hidden
only for "nickserv").

A new rmodifier "message\_auth" has been added to hide passwords displayed by
command `/msg nickserv identify|register|ghost|release` and the rmodifier
"nickserv" has been renamed to "command\_auth".

If you never added/changed rmodifiers, you can just reset all rmodifiers:

```
/rmodifier default -yes
```

If you added/changed some rmodifiers, do it manually with these commands:

```
/rmodifier del nickserv
/rmodifier add command_auth history_add,input_text_display,irc_command_auth 1,4* ^(/(msg|quote) +nickserv +(id|identify|register|ghost \S+|release \S+) +)(.*)
/rmodifier add message_auth irc_message_auth 1,3* ^(.*(id|identify|register|ghost \S+|release \S+) +)(.*)
```

### Lua constants

For consistency with other supported languages, the API constants in Lua have
been redefined as constants instead of functions.

Therefore, the use of a constant must be changed: the parentheses must be
removed.

The old syntax was:

```
return weechat.WEECHAT_RC_OK()
```

The new syntax is:

```
return weechat.WEECHAT_RC_OK
```

### Guile callbacks

The way to give arguments for guile callbacks has been fixed: now arguments are
sent individually (instead of a list with all arguments inside).

Therefore, existing guile scripts must be modified accordingly. Moreover,
WeeChat now requires Guile â¥ 2.0 to compile.

## Version 0.4.0 (2013-01-20)

### Conditions in bars

Conditions in bars have changed, and now an expression is evaluated.

If you have a value with many conditions in a bar, like: `nicklist,active`, you
must now use an expression like: `${nicklist} && ${active}` (see the chapter
about bars in the *WeeChat User’s guide*).

### IPv6 by default

#### IRC

IPv6 is now used by default to connect to IRC servers, with fallback to
IPv4. The option *irc.server\_default.ipv6* is now "on" by default. If IPv6 is
not enabled or fails, IPv4 will be used. The "ipv6" option in server is now
used to disable IPv6 and force IPv4 (if option is turned "off").

#### Relay

Relay plugin is now listening by default on an IPv6 socket (new option
*relay.network.ipv6*, on by default), so connections with IPv4 will have
IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, like: "::ffff:127.0.0.1" (for "127.0.0.1"); check
that value of option *relay.network.allowed\_ips* supports this mapping, or
disable IPv6 in relay if you don’t plan to use it at all:

```
/set relay.network.ipv6 off
```

## Version 0.3.9.2 (2012-11-18)

This version fixes a security vulnerability when a plugin/script gives
untrusted command to API function "hook\_process".

## Version 0.3.9.1 (2012-11-09)

This version fixes crash when decoding IRC colors in strings.

## Version 0.3.9 (2012-09-29)

### Options moved

Options moved from core (weechat.conf) to irc plugin (irc.conf):

* *weechat.look.nickmode* moved to *irc.look.nick\_mode* (new type: integer
  with values: none/prefix/action/both)
* *weechat.look.nickmode\_empty* moved to *irc.look.nick\_mode\_empty*

### New bar item buffer\_modes

A new bar item has been added: *buffer\_modes* and irc option
*irc.look.item\_channel\_modes* has been removed; to display irc channel modes in
status bar (after channel name), you have to manually add the new item
*buffer\_modes* (this is now used by default in status bar items), default value
for status bar items becomes:

```
/set weechat.bar.status.items "[time],[buffer_count],[buffer_plugin],buffer_number+:+buffer_name+(buffer_modes)+{buffer_nicklist_count}+buffer_filter,[lag],[hotlist],completion,scroll"
```

### Command /aspell

New options in command `/aspell`:

* `enable`: enable aspell
* `disable`: disable aspell
* `toggle`: toggle aspell (new default key: `Alt`+`s`)

Options renamed in command `/aspell`:

* `enable` renamed to `setdict` (set dictionary for current buffer)
* `disable` renamed to `deldict` (delete dictionary used on current buffer)
* `dictlist` renamed to `listdict` (show installed dictionaries)

### Horizontal separator

An horizontal separator has been added between split windows, and two options
have been added to toggle separators (both are enabled by default):

* *weechat.look.window\_separator\_horizontal*
* *weechat.look.window\_separator\_vertical*

### New keys

New keys were added, use command `/key missing` to add them or `/key listdiff`
to see differences between your current keys and WeeChat default keys.

## Version 0.3.8 (2012-06-03)

### Options

Options *weechat.look.prefix\_align\_more* and
*weechat.look.prefix\_buffer\_align\_more* have been converted from type boolean
to string:

* If the value was on (default), new value is "+" and you can now customize
  this char.
* If the value was off, you have to set " " (string with one space).

### Paste detection

Option *weechat.look.paste\_max\_lines* can now be used with value 0 to detect
paste with one line (only if terminal "bracketed paste mode" is enabled when
option *weechat.look.paste\_bracketed* is on); so now the value -1 is used to
disable paste detection: if your value was 0, you should set it to -1:

```
/set weechat.look.paste_max_lines -1
```

### Rmodifier

Rmodifier "nickserv" has a new default regex which includes option "release"
for command `/msg nickserv`.

If you never added/changed rmodifiers, you can just reset all rmodifiers:

```
/rmodifier default -yes
```

If you added/changed some rmodifiers, do it manually with these commands:

```
/rmodifier del nickserv
/rmodifier add nickserv history_add,input_text_display 1,4* ^(/(msg|quote) +nickserv +(id|identify|ghost \S+|release \S+) +)(.*)
```

## Version 0.3.7 (2012-02-26)

### Options

Option `scroll_unread` has been moved from command `/input` to `/window`,
therefore default command of key `Alt`+`u` has been updated. To bind key with
new default value:

```
/key bind meta-u /window scroll_unread
```

Option *weechat.history.max\_lines* has been renamed to
*weechat.history.max\_buffer\_lines\_number*.

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

Option *weechat.plugin.extension* now supports list of extensions, and new
default value is ".so,.dll" (with this value, weechat.conf is compatible with
Cygwin).

### Extended regex

Extended regex is used in filters and irc ignore, so some chars that needed
escape in past do not need any more (for example `[0-9]\+` becomes `[0-9]+`),
filters and ignore have to be manually fixed.

Option *weechat.look.highlight\_regex* becomes case insensitive by default, to
make it case sensitive, use "(?-i)" at beginning of string, for example:
"(?-i)FlashCode|flashy".

## Version 0.3.6 (2011-10-22)

### Options

Option *weechat.look.hline\_char* has been renamed to
*weechat.look.separator\_horizontal*.

If you changed the value of this option, you must set it again after upgrade.

### Bold in colors

Bold is not used any more for basic colors (used only if terminal has less than
16 colors), a new option has been added to force bold if needed:
*weechat.look.color\_basic\_force\_bold*.

## Version 0.3.5 (2011-05-15)

### Colors

If you have some colors defined in section "palette" with version 0.3.4, you
should remove all colors defined, and add new aliases (it’s not needed any more
to add colors before using them).

Colors for nick prefixes (char for op, voice, ..) are defined in a single
option *irc.color.nick\_prefixes*, therefore following options will be lost:
*irc.color.nick\_prefix\_op*, *irc.color.nick\_prefix\_halfop*,
*irc.color.nick\_prefix\_voice*, *irc.color.nick\_prefix\_user*.

### Hotlist

#### Counters

Count of messages have been added to hotlist by default, if you want to come
back to old behavior, do that:

```
/set weechat.look.hotlist_count_max 0
/set weechat.look.hotlist_buffer_separator ","
```

#### Away and current buffer

When you are away, all buffers are now added to hotlist by default (even if
they are displayed in a window), if you want to come back to old behavior, do
that:

```
/set weechat.look.hotlist_add_buffer_if_away off
```

### New keys

New keys were added, use command `/key missing` to add them or `/key listdiff`
to see differences between your current keys and WeeChat default keys.

## Version 0.3.4 (2011-01-16)

### After /upgrade

If you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release:

* Some nick prefixes can be wrong, so it is recommended to do `/allchan names`.
* Nick colors are defined with a new option *weechat.color.chat\_nick\_colors*,
  therefore old options *weechat.color.chat\_nick\_color1..10* will be lost when
  upgrading.
* Nick colors in messages displayed will be wrong if you changed some nick
  colors (old default colors will be used).

### Options

Some IRC options have been renamed, before upgrading to this version, note
value for old options, and set them again with new name:

* options moved from *network* section to servers (with global value, and
  server value, like other server options):

  + *irc.network.connection\_timeout* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.connection\_timeout*
  + *irc.network.anti\_flood\_prio\_high* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.anti\_flood\_prio\_high*
  + *irc.network.anti\_flood\_prio\_low* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.anti\_flood\_prio\_low*
  + *irc.network.away\_check* moved to *irc.server\_default.away\_check*
  + *irc.network.away\_check\_max\_nicks* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.away\_check\_max\_nicks*
  + *irc.network.default\_msg\_part* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.default\_msg\_part*
  + *irc.network.default\_msg\_quit* moved to
    *irc.server\_default.default\_msg\_quit*
* other IRC options renamed:

  + *irc.look.open\_channel\_near\_server* moved to *irc.look.new\_channel\_position*
    (old option was boolean, new is integer with value as string)
  + *irc.look.open\_pv\_near\_server* moved to *irc.look.new\_pv\_position*
    (old option was boolean, new is integer with value as string)

## Version 0.3.3 (2010-08-07)

### After /upgrade

If you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release, then you must reconnect to
IRC servers in order to use new command /wallchops.

### Options

Option *irc.look.show\_away\_once* has been renamed to
*irc.look.display\_pv\_away\_once*.

Option *irc.network.lag\_min\_show* is now in milliseconds, you should set new
value: your current value multiplied by 1000 (new default value is 500).

## Version 0.3.2 (2010-04-18)

### After /upgrade

If you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release, then you must execute this
command on all IRC servers/channels/private buffers and xfer DCC chats (not
needed on WeeChat core buffer or buffers from other plugins/scripts):

```
/buffer set highlight_words $nick
```

## Version 0.3.1.1 (2010-01-31)

This version fixes crashes with SSL connection and purge of old DCC chats.

All users of version 0.3.1 should upgrade to this version.

## Version 0.3.1 (2010-01-23)

### Aliases

IRC commands /ame and /amsg are now aliases, if you are upgrading from version
0.3.0, you must create aliases with following commands:

```
/alias aaway allserv /away
/alias ame allchan /me
/alias amsg allchan /amsg *
/alias anick allserv /nick
```

## Version 0.3.0 (2009-09-06)

This version brings **MAJOR** changes, especially for configuration files and
plugin API and is not compatible with previous versions.

Major differences:

* It is **NOT POSSIBLE** to use command `/upgrade` from a version 0.2.x to 0.3.x;
  you have to quit your old WeeChat, then run new version.
* New configuration files (`.conf`) are not compatible with old files
  (`.rc`).
* Name of options is similar to old versions, but there is now one
  configuration file by plugin, and one file for WeeChat core; there is
  **no automatic conversion** for your old options to new configuration files,
  so you’ll have to setup again your IRC servers and all other options.
* Plugin API has been rewritten and is not compatible with previous versions;
  accordingly, scripts and plugins must have been designed for version 0.3.x to
  be loaded into WeeChat.

## Version 0.2.6.3 (2009-06-13)

This version fixes gnutls detection.

## Version 0.2.6.2 (2009-04-18)

This version fixes a bug with charset decoding (like *iso2022jp*).

## Version 0.2.6.1 (2009-03-14)

This version fixes a major bug: crash with some special chars in IRC messages.

## Version 0.2.6 (2007-09-06)

No release note.

## Version 0.2.5 (2007-06-07)

No release note.

## Version 0.2.4 (2007-03-29)

No release note.

## Version 0.2.3 (2007-01-10)

This version fixes several major bugs of version 0.2.2.

All users of version 0.2.2 should upgrade to this version.

## Version 0.2.2 (2007-01-06)

### Charset plugin

For users of any previous version, all your charset settings in weechat.rc will
be LOST! You should save your weechat.rc to keep your values and set them again
with new *charset* plugin.

For ISO users: history of channels may be without accents (after `/upgrade`),
this is not recoverable, but this is not a bug. All new messages should be OK.

Be careful, now default encode is UTF-8 for all channels (before it was
terminal charset). If you still want to send messages as *ISO-8859-1*, you
should set either global encode or server specific encode to *ISO-8859-1*.

For global encode:

```
/setp charset.global.encode = "ISO-8859-1"
```

For server encode (on server buffer):

```
/charset encode ISO-8859-1
```

### New keys

New keys for topic scroll: `F9`/`F10`.

Key `F10` was used for `infobar_clear` in previous WeeChat versions, you
have to manually rebind this key (except for new WeeChat users):

```
/key <press alt+"k" then F10> scroll_topic_right
```

Which gives something like:

```
/key meta2-21~ scroll_topic_right
```

## Version 0.2.1 (2006-10-01)

No release note.

## Version 0.2.0 (2006-08-19)

### After /upgrade

If you upgraded with `/upgrade` in WeeChat, you should `/disconnect` and then
`/reconnect` on each server, to display properly channel/user modes.

### Plugins

If you’re using plugins, you should remove some old plugins libraries in
WeeChat system library directory (commonly */usr/local/lib/weechat/plugins*):
remove `lib*` files (like `libperl.`, `libpython.`, ..) and keep only new
libraries (`perl.`, `python.`, ..).

## Version 0.1.9 (2006-05-25)

### DCC chat

Please close all DCC chat buffers before using /upgrade command, otherwise you
may experience problems with DCC chats.

### Script API

Some changes in script API: now timer handlers functions takes exactly 0 (zero)
argument (in version 0.1.8, two arguments were mandatory but not used: server
and arguments).

## Version 0.1.8 (2006-03-18)

### After /upgrade

After installing 0.1.8 (or with `/upgrade`), issue both commands (if you didn’t
redefine these keys (`Alt`+`Home` / `Alt`+`End`):

```
/key unbind meta-meta2-1~
/key unbind meta-meta2-4~
```

Then launch again WeeChat (or issue `/upgrade`).

### Configuration files

It is recommended for users of version 0.1.7 (or any older), to replace values
in setup file (*~/.weechat/weechat.rc*):

* option: log\_path: replace *~/.weechat/logs* by *%h/logs*
* option: plugins\_path: replace *~/.weechat/plugins* by *%h/plugins*

The string *%h* is replaced by WeeChat home (default: *~/.weechat*, may be
overridden by new command line argument `--dir`).

### Keys

Keys `Alt`+`Home` / `Alt`+`End` were used for nicklist scroll, they’re now
replaced by `Alt`+`F11` / `Alt`+`F12`.

## Version 0.1.7 (2006-01-14)

### Ruby

Ruby script plugin has been added but is experimental in this release. You’re
warned!

### Command /away

Command `/away` was changed to be RFC 2812 compliant. Now argument is required
to set away, and no argument means remove away ("back").

Option *irc\_default\_msg\_away* has been removed.

## Version 0.1.6 (2005-11-11)

### Script API

Incompatibility with some old scripts: now all handlers have to return a code
for completion, and to do some actions about message to ignore (please look at
documentation for detail).

### OpenBSD

On OpenBSD, the new option *plugins\_extension* should be set to *.so.0.0* since
the plugins names are ending by *.so.0.0* and not *.so*.

### UTF-8

With new and full UTF-8 support, the option *look\_charset\_internal* should be
set to blank for most cases. Forces it only if your locale is not properly
detected by WeeChat (you can set *UTF-8* or *ISO-8859-15* for example,
depending on your locale). WeeChat is looking for *UTF-8* in your locale name
at startup.
