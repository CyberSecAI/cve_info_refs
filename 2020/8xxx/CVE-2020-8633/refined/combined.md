# Security Fixes

| Bug# | Summary | CVE-ID | CVSS Score | Zimbra Rating | Fix Patch Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| n/a | Revoked share calendars are now being removed from OLK profile. | CVE-2020-8633 | - | - | 8.8.15p7 |
| n/a | Potential for SSRF if WebEx zimlet installed and zimlet JSP enabled | CVE-2020-7796 | - | - | 8.8.15p7 |

# What's New

| Docs Server | Zimbra Docs server installer is available for Ubuntu 18, Ubuntu 16 and RHEL 7. You can download the Docs server installers from the [Zimbra Docs](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-docs/) page. |
| --- | --- |
| ZCS | `zmmboxmove` command generated "Read timed out" error when using foreground (`--sync`) mode. This issue is now fixed. |
| Zimbra Drive | Files sent via Zimbra Connect are now visible in Zimbra Drive under a new “Connect Sent Files” root folder. |
| Zimbra Connect | The Zimbra Connect database has been migrated from Zimbra’s MariaDB to a dedicated HSQL instance. Migration is automatically handled during an upgrade. |
| Zimbra Connect | We are now enforcing a hard limit of 4096 characters to all chat messages so that long messages no longer appear truncated in the message history. |

# Fixed Issues

| ZCS | Fixed a bug in the EWS extension that was creating tmp files with the prefix `/opt/zimbra/jetty_base/work/cxf-`. These files led to a rapid increase in disk space in some instances. |
| --- | --- |
| ZCS | Fixed an issue wherein users were not able to send an email using send-as (persona) with an attachment |
| ZCS | With the default cipher configuration, \*Weak cipher suite\* warnings appear in the logs. No security concern is associated with the presence of these suites, as they are not used. The warnings may be suppressed by following the instructions in [KB23863](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/index.php?curid=23863). |
| ZCO | Fixed Zimbra Migration Tool which was skipping folders due to container class `IPF.NOTE` |
| ZCO | MS Office 2007 has reached the end of its extended support period so it is no longer supported by any version of ZCO. Current documentation has been updated to reflect this. |
| Zimbra Connect | Updated timezone management to reflect the changes in Brazilian DST usage. |
| Zimbra Connect | Emojis were temporarily disabled in Patch 5 due to a character set incompatibility with an updated version of Zimbra's database. The problem is now resolved, and emojis are re-enabled. Both the sender and the receiver must be on a server running 8.8.15p7 or higher for the emojis to work as intended. |
| HSM | Fixed a bug that could cause a false positive “Backup Path is case insensitive“ blocking error. |
| NG Backup | The RealTime scanner did not detect the creation of mount-points. This issue has been fixed. |
| NG Mobile | Fixed a bug that caused the response to a complex-repeated calendar appointment to fail. |
| NG Mobile | An iteration error prevented edits made to recurring appointments from correctly syncing with the server. This issue is now fixed. |
| NG Mobile | Device List management now has Zimlet performance improvements so that the initial request that populates the list does not timeout on infrastructures with multiple `mailboxd` servers. |
| Zimbra Network Modules NG | Fixed a bug that could cause pre-auth validation to fail due to a `NullPointerException` error while processing Admin NG `SOAP` commands. As a temporary workaround, stop the logging of Admin NG service with `zxsuite admin doStopService logging`. Reapply after every mailbox service restart, but note that doing so prevents Admin NG from gathering the information needed to compile its monthly report. |

# Patch Installation

Please refer to the steps below to install 8.8.15 Patch 7 on [Redhat](#Redhat) and [Ubuntu](#Ubuntu) platforms:

Before Installing the Patch

Before installing the patch, consider the following:

* Patches are cumulative.
* A full backup should be performed before any patch is applied. There is no automated roll-back.
* Zimlet patches can include removing existing Zimlets and redeploying the patched Zimlet.
* Only files or Zimlets associated with installed packages will be installed from the patch.
* Switch to `zimbra` user before using ZCS CLI commands.
* **Important!** You cannot revert to the previous ZCS release after you upgrade to the patch.
* **Important Note for ZCS Setup with Local ZCS repository:** Customers who have set up local ZCS repository should first update the local repository by following instructions in [wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository#Keep_the_local_Repository_up_to_date)
* Please make note that, installing the zimbra-patch package only updates the Zimbra core packages.
