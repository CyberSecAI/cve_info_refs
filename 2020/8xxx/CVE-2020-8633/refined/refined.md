- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to the handling of revoked shared calendars in Outlook profiles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that revoked share calendars were not being properly removed from Outlook profiles. This could lead to users retaining access to calendars they should no longer have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in unauthorized access to calendar information for users whose calendar access has been revoked. This could potentially expose sensitive or private information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Zimbra Collaboration platform's interaction with Outlook profiles when sharing calendars and then revoking access to those calendars.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have had prior access to a user's calendar that was subsequently revoked, and the vulnerability would allow the attacker to potentially maintain access to the calendar through their Outlook profile.
