This document contains information about multiple security vulnerabilities in Webmin and Usermin, but it **does** contain information related to **CVE-2020-8820**.

**CVE-2020-8820:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability lies in the Command Shell module of Webmin where a user with the privilege to create custom commands could exploit other users via unescaped HTML.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient output sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript that would execute in the context of another user's session when they access the crafted command. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** A user with command creation privileges crafts malicious HTML within a custom command. Another user who has access to the command shell module views a listing that includes the crafted command, or attempts to execute the crafted command.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Webmin access with permissions to create custom commands. The targeted user must have access to the command shell module and trigger the malicious command listing or attempt to execute the command.
