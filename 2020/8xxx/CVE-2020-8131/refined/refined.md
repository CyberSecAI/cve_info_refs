Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8131:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the Yarn package manager. Specifically, it was possible to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem during the `yarn install` process under certain circumstances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The core issue is the ability to manipulate file paths, allowing writing outside the intended directory.
- Arbitrary File Write: Attackers could write files to any location they could specify, due to insufficient path sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By writing malicious files to specific locations, particularly those involved in startup scripts or configurations, attackers could achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.
- System compromise: Full control over the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable through the network as malicious packages can be downloaded and installed through the internet or local network.
- Malicious Package: The attacker must create a malicious package that contains the malicious file paths that will exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious package that exploits the path traversal vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim into installing this malicious package via the `yarn install` command.
- User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction to install the malicious package.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Yarn versions 1.21.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.22.0 of Yarn.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity due to the potential for code execution.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved sanitizing file paths during the fetch process.
- The CVSS v3 base metrics are AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The EPSS score for the vulnerability is 0.563%.
