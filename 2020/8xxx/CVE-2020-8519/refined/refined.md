Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-8519:

**CVE-2020-8519**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `search` parameter in the `listRecords` function of the `Records.php` file. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-provided data from the `search[value]` parameter into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerable code block is:
        ```php
        if(!empty($_POST["search"]["value"])){
            $sqlQuery .= 'where(id LIKE "%'.$_POST["search"]["value"].'%" ';
            $sqlQuery .= ' OR name LIKE "%'.$_POST["search"]["value"].'%" ';
            $sqlQuery .= ' OR designation LIKE "%'.$_POST["search"]["value"].'%" ';
            $sqlQuery .= ' OR address LIKE "%'.$_POST["search"]["value"].'%" ';
            $sqlQuery .= ' OR skills LIKE "%'.$_POST["search"]["value"].'%") ';
        }
        ```

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
        *   Read sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, personal information).
        *   Modify or delete data within the database.
        *   Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server, depending on the database setup and permissions.
    *   The impact can range from data breaches and data manipulation to complete compromise of the web application and its underlying infrastructure.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is the `search[value]` parameter in a POST request to `ajax_action.php`.
    *   An attacker can manipulate the `search[value]` parameter by injecting malicious SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `ajax_action.php` endpoint.
    *   No special privileges are required; anyone who can access the website can attempt this attack.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content also details two other SQL Injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-8520 and CVE-2020-8521) within the same script, related to the `order` and `limit` clauses. This confirms the lack of proper sanitization throughout the database query building process.
*   The exploit code provided uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited, showcasing the ability to perform both time-based blind SQL injection and UNION-based SQL injection.

In summary, CVE-2020-8519 is a SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization, which could result in unauthorized database access and manipulation.
