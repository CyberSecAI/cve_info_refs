Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `salt-api` daemon, which runs on SUSE Manager Servers to control SUSE Manager clients (minions), was accessible to any user on the server. Although it was intended to be limited to `localhost`, the HTTP endpoint was neither encrypted nor authenticated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `salt-api` endpoint did not require any form of authentication.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** Communication with the `salt-api` endpoint was not encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Insecure Access Control:** The `salt-api` service was accessible to all users on the SUSE Manager server, not just authorized processes.
*   **Exposed API with Root Capabilities:** The `salt-api` essentially has root access on all minions, and access to the API allows for arbitrary command execution on those minions, and the SUSE Manager server itself as the `salt` user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution on Minions:** Any non-root user on the SUSE Manager Server could use the API to execute arbitrary code as root on any connected client (minion).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution on Server:** Any non-root user could execute arbitrary code on the SUSE Manager server as the `salt` user, which could potentially lead to further privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the SUSE Manager Server (i.e., any non-root user on the server) could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `salt-api` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to have local access to the SUSE Manager Server as any non-root user.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `salt-api` endpoint, which is located on `localhost:9080`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided example shows how to list all Salt clients using a `curl` command, demonstrating how easily the API could be abused.
*   The vulnerability was addressed through updates for various versions of SUSE Manager.
*   The vulnerability was classified as "important" with a CVSSv3.1 score of 7.8, indicating a significant security risk.
