| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c0)  Malte Kraus   2020-08-28 10:39:07 UTC  ``` Any SUSE Manager Server runs a `salt-master` daemon to control SUSE Manager clients (aka minions). `salt-master` basically has root access on all of them.  In addition to `salt-master`, a `salt-api` daemon is also running on each SUSE Manager Server and offers an HTTP endpoint to expose its functionality to other SUSE Manager components (a Tomcat application and a cron-like background task runner called Taskomatic). So clients of `salt-api` basically have root access on all minions.  Currently access to `salt-api` is limited to `localhost`, and we thought we were safe - but the endpoint is not encrypted nor authenticated. It was pointed out that any non-root user of the SUSE Manager Server can trivially use curl to run arbitrary code on any minion as root, and arbitrary code on the SUSE Manager Server itself as user `salt` (which is not as bad as root, but it might lead to further privilege escalations).  # Example exploits  I successfully reproduced the issue on our test SUSE Manager Server, details below. You can log into manager.suse.de with your SUSE user and try yourself.  ## List all Salt clients  ```sh curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d @- localhost:9080/run << EOF {    "client": "wheel",    "eauth": "auto",    "username": "admin",    "password": "any string will do",    "fun": "key.list_all" } EOF ``` ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2020-08-31 12:13:23 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2020-8028 to track this ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c3)  Silvio Moioli   2020-08-31 13:44:57 UTC  ``` Adding our Release Engineer in CC. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c17)  Julio González Gil   2020-09-09 12:21:45 UTC  ``` All required submissions for 3.2, 4.0 (including release notes) and 4.1 are now ready and reported by the bot at the comments above. ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c23)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-09-16 12:24:46 UTC  ``` Now public, updates released for the supported SUMA versions ``` [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1175884#c24)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-16 16:18:10 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:2648-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
