| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-19 13:13:34 UTC  ``` The security team is currently sanity checking the profiles in the Base:System/permissions package. While doing so we noticed the following issues with entries related to the pcp package:  The following paths are no longer part of the package:  - /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmdabash - /var/lib/pcp/tmp/mmv  Have last been seen in openSUSE-Leap-42.2 in package pcp-3.6.10-8.25.x86_64.rpm.  The following paths have no corresponding %set_permissions and %verify_permissions invocation in the package's spec file:  - /var/lib/pcp/tmp - /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie - /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger  These paths have the following settings the permissions package's profiles:  permissions.easy:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/		root:root	  1777 permissions.easy:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger/	root:root	  1777 permissions.easy:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie/		root:root	  1777  permissions.secure:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/		root:root	  0755 permissions.secure:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger/	root:root	  0755 permissions.secure:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie/		root:root	  0755  permissions.paranoid:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/		root:root	  0755 permissions.paranoid:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger/	root:root	  0755 permissions.paranoid:	/var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie/		root:root	  0755  The invocation of %set_permissions and %verify_permissions was removed in the Factory package in revision 36 when a dedicated user and group 'pcp:pcp' have been introduced for the directories listed above. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-19 13:23:06 UTC  ``` This issue is a possible security problem, because although the package is no longer calling %set_permissions and %verify_permissions, whenever the `ckstat` tool is called (this is done sooner or later through other package installations), the permissions from the profiles will apply.  On Leap 15.1 it looks like follows. After `zypper in pcp` the following directory permissions are set:   # ls -lhd /var/lib/pcp/tmp  drwxrwxr-x  5 pcp  pcp  4.0K 19. Mai 15:08 /var/lib/pcp/tmp  After calling chkstat the following happens.   # chkstat --system  Checking permissions and ownerships - using the permissions files  	/etc/permissions  	/etc/permissions.easy  	/etc/permissions.d/postfix  	/etc/permissions.d/texlive  	/etc/permissions.d/texlive.texlive  	/etc/permissions.local  setting /var/lib/pcp/tmp/ to root:root 1777. (wrong owner/group pcp:pcp permissions 0775)  setting /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger/ to root:root 1777. (wrong owner/group pcp:pcp permissions 0775)  setting /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie/ to root:root 1777. (wrong owner/group pcp:pcp permissions 0775)   # ls -lhd /var/lib/pcp/tmp  drwxrwxrwt 5 root root 4.0K 19. Mai 15:08 /var/lib/pcp/tmp  So the directories previously owned by pcp:pcp with mode 0775 are now public sticky bit directories again. Depending on how the directories are used by the pcp programs this can lead to security issues. In any case it is a terrible inconsistency and unexpected for the pcp package.  This happens only when the "easy" permissions profile is set. On SLE the "secure" permissions profile is the default. There the directories would end up as root:root with permissions 0755, thereby probably only breaking pcp.  On current Tumbleweed the situation regarding security is not that bad, because the `chkstat` tool has a number of security measures builtin that prevent lowering the security. There the output looks like follows:   # chkstat --system  /var/lib/pcp/tmp/: has unexpected owner. refusing to correct due to unknown integrity.  /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmdabash/: on an insecure path - /var/lib/pcp/tmp has different non-root owner who could tamper with the file.  /var/lib/pcp/tmp/mmv/: on an insecure path - /var/lib/pcp/tmp has different non-root owner who could tamper with the file.  /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmlogger/: on an insecure path - /var/lib/pcp/tmp has different non-root owner who could tamper with the file.  /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie/: on an insecure path - /var/lib/pcp/tmp has different non-root owner who could tamper with the file.  What needs to be done to fix this is to remove the entries from the permission package's profiles. Also in all codestreams where pcp is maintained. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-19 13:27:39 UTC  ``` This is an embargoed bug. This means that this information is not public. Please - do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this is public - do not make this bug public - Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-12-SP5:GA and SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:GA codestreams are available via OBS. This means that you can't submit security fixes for embargoed issues to these GA codestreams under development until they become public. In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security), RocketChat (#security) or send us a mail. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-19 13:28:23 UTC  ``` Internal CRD: 2020-08-17 or earlier ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c4)  David Disseldorp   2020-05-19 14:51:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c1)) ... > What needs to be done to fix this is to remove the entries from the > permission > package's profiles. Also in all codestreams where pcp is maintained.  Hmm, I seem to recall that these profile entries were added around the time that some tempdir races were fixed. Since then there was some further work on privilege  separation (e.g. splitting out /proc parsers etc. from main daemons) so that most services now run as pcp. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-28 09:58:12 UTC  ``` I will remove the permissions entries for pcp completely from Factory.  All maintained codestreams of pcp look to be also affected by this issue. So we will need backports to the permissions package in the respective codestreams.  A problem is that even when the permissions package is corrected, possibly wrong permissions will remain for the pcp directories. Thus we might need to ship "empty"/fake updates for pcp to get the permissions actually fixed via RPM.  I'll also have to look into the security situation if there are actual attack vectors introduced due to the wrong permissions. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c6)  David Disseldorp   2020-05-28 11:39:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c5)) > I will remove the permissions entries for pcp completely from Factory. >  > All maintained codestreams of pcp look to be also affected by this issue.

That sounds like a reasonable approach to me.  > I'll also have to look into the security situation if there are actual attack > vectors introduced due to the wrong permissions.  Thanks. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-06-03 13:30:06 UTC  ``` I will start updates for the permissions package to remove the pcp entries.  It's a bit complex, since the permissions package has different maintained codestreams than the pcp package. It looks like the following permissions codestreams need to be addressed:  SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:Update SUSE:SLE-12-SP5:Update SUSE:SLE-15:GA SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:GA SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:GA  15-SP2:GA is still under development and should be done last, because it's publically visible in OBS and thus break the embargo. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c17)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-07-06 19:13:21 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:1860-1: An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.

The 'secure' and 'paranoid' profile settings will only break pcp programs, because they can no longer place files in the expected locations. The 'easy' profile setting is more dangerous, however. Since these settings give the respective directories world-writeable sticky-bit permissions, anybody can place files in there.  pcp has got a huge code base so I won't completely review everything. The base directory /var/lib/pcp/tmp is configured via the PCP_TMP_DIR setting in /etc/pcp.conf. Within the code this setting is queried via `pmGetConfig("PCP_TMP_DIR")`. This setting is used at least in libpcp, pmdas, mpieconf, mpie and pmlogger. Each individual utility uses one of the sub-directories like /var/lib/pcp/tmp/pmie.  Some of the files are memory-mapped by the tools. Some files contain binary data structures. The pmie sub-directory seems to contain binary data for each process in the system.  This means an attacker could place fake data there, or data that causes the pcp programs to crash or otherwise misbehave. Since the pcp daemons seems to run under the unprivileged pcp user a local root exploit will not be that easy, at least.  I suggest we assign a single CVE for this, because otherwise we'd need to pull a dozen or even more of them and would need to analyze this situation in detail and that's not really efficient. ``` [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c22)  Johannes Segitz   2020-07-14 11:19:30 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2020-8025 to track this ``` [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c23)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-01-21 09:52:46 UTC  ``` Somehow we failed to keep the permissions SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update codestream in sync with our GitHub SLE-15-SP2 branch. This the fix in that codestream has been missing up until now.  I just submitted a maintenance update for it.  Since we are dropping permissions from the profiles, future `chkstat --system` invocations will *not* fix possibly wrong permissions. The pcp package needs to reapply its regular permissions for these paths. So we might need to create pseudo updates for pcp after the permissions are finally fixed in all codestreams. ``` [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c25)  Marcus Meissner   2021-01-22 10:47:38 UTC  ``` I think the only safe way, and what we used previously, is keep the permissions of the binaries, but set them the their regular RPM permissions e.g. 0755 . ``` [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c26)  Matthias Gerstner   2021-01-22 11:02:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to meissner@suse.com from [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c25)) > I think the only safe way, and what we used previously, is keep the > permissions of the binaries, but set them the their regular RPM permissions > e.g. 0755 .  That would mean we would need to do another update round. And there is no defined end to when these "safety" entries can be dropped. We just got rid of some of these kind of fixup entries that lingered in the permissions package for more than a decade.  It also brings the problem that again the actual package's permissions and what the permissions package sets can diverge. It's a big mess :-( ``` [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1171883#c27)  Swamp Workflow Management   2021-01-22 17:25:50 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2021:0197-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
