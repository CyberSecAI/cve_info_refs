{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Outdated entries in the permissions profiles for `/var/lib/pcp/tmp/*` in the `permissions` package. These entries were not removed when the pcp package changed to using a dedicated `pcp` user and group, and stopped using `%set_permissions` and `%verify_permissions`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The permissions profiles still contained entries for `/var/lib/pcp/tmp` and subdirectories, leading to incorrect permissions being applied by `chkstat`",
	  "Specifically, when using the 'easy' profile, directories previously owned by `pcp:pcp` with mode `0775` could be changed to world-writable sticky bit directories owned by `root:root`"
    ],
    "impact": "The incorrect permissions could allow an attacker to place malicious files in `/var/lib/pcp/tmp` or its subdirectories. These files could be used to cause the pcp programs to crash or misbehave. The impact of the incorrect permissions are dependent on the permissions profile used. The 'secure' and 'paranoid' profile settings will only break pcp programs, while the 'easy' profile can allow arbitrary file placement",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attacker who can modify files in `/var/lib/pcp/tmp` after incorrect permissions have been applied.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires the ability to place files into the world-writable sticky bit directories within `/var/lib/pcp/tmp` after `chkstat` has been run with the 'easy' profile in use. ",
    "additional_information": "The `chkstat` tool is used to verify and set permissions according to the `/etc/permissions` files. The vulnerability is present when the `permissions.easy` profile is used. The 'secure' and 'paranoid' profiles, which are used by default on SLE systems, would result in permissions that would break pcp. Tumbleweed has a built-in security measure in `chkstat` that prevents lowering the security, this means that this vulnerability is not present there"
