Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-8656 (Based on the provided content from github.com)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `username` parameter of the `getApiKey` function within the EON API. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `username` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:**  It could be possible to modify or delete data.
- **Denial of Service:** The `sleep(3)` example suggests that an attacker could induce delays. Other more intensive queries could lead to a denial of service condition.
- **Complete Database Compromise:** Depending on database privileges of the application, an attacker could gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is conducted through an HTTP GET request to the `/eonapi/getApiKey` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Username Parameter:** The malicious SQL injection payload is inserted into the `username` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to know SQL syntax to formulate malicious queries.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the `/eonapi/getApiKey` endpoint and the `username` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example injection is: `/eonapi/getApiKey?username=' union select sleep(3),0,0,0,0,0,0,0 or '`
- This injection uses `'` to break out of the original query's string, injects a `union select sleep(3),...` clause, and then injects `or '` to ensure a valid query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on February 5, 2020, indicating a potentially older vulnerability.
- The impacted version is EON 5.3, with the reported API version being 2.4.2.
