{
  "CVE-2020-8517": {
    "description": "A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the nonce reference counter within the HTTP Digest Authentication mechanism of Squid.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Credential replay vulnerability",
         "Potential remote code execution"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to restricted resources. If memory pooling is disabled, this could lead to remote code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network attacks"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to sniff network traffic to obtain valid authentication nonces. They must also be able to send HTTP requests to the Squid proxy."
