The provided content describes authentication bypass vulnerabilities in two WordPress plugins: InfiniteWP Client and WP Time Capsule.

**InfiniteWP Client <= 1.9.4.4**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `iwp_mmb_set_request` function in `init.php`. This function doesn't perform authorization checks for specific actions (`readd_site` or `add_site`) and populates the `request_params` variable, using a supplied username to log in the requester without authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Missing authorization check for the specified actions, allowing arbitrary user login by supplying a username.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can gain administrative access to a WordPress site.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A POST request with a specially crafted JSON-encoded and Base64-encoded payload containing the `iwp_action` parameter set to either `readd_site` or `add_site`, along with the target administrator username.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the username of an administrator on the site.

**WP Time Capsule <= 1.21.15**

*   **Root cause:** The `parse_request` function in `wptc-cron-functions.php` checks for the string `IWP_JSON_PREFIX` in the raw POST payload. If found, it calls `wptc_login_as_admin`, logging the attacker in as the first available administrator without further checks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Missing authentication and authorization when processing requests containing the prefix `IWP_JSON_PREFIX`, allowing arbitrary login as an administrator.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain administrative access to a WordPress site.
*   **Attack vectors:** A raw POST request containing the string `IWP_JSON_PREFIX`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific requirements are mentioned beyond the ability to send a raw POST request containing the prefix.

The document also mentions that these vulnerabilities are difficult to block with general firewall rules, because the payloads don't look suspicious. The developers quickly patched the vulnerabilities after being informed and a module was added in the Patchstack firewall to block these attacks, as the plugins didn't hook into the WordPress core properly.
