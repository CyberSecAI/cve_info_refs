  "CVE-2020-8919": {
    "description": "This change fixes a misconception that leads to data being accessible through Gerrit APIs that should be locked down. Gerrit had two components for determining if a Git ref is visible to a user: (Default)RefFilter and PermissionBackend#ForRef (ex RefControl). The former was always capable of providing correct results for all refs. The latter only had logic to decide if a Git ref is visible according to the Gerrit READ permissions. This includes all refs under refs/heads as well as any other ref that isn't a database ref or a Git tag. This component was unware of Git tags and database references. Hence, when asked for a database reference such as refs/changes/xx/yyyyxx/meta the logic would allow access if the user has READ permissions on any of the ref prefixes, such as the default `read refs/* Anonymous Users`. That is problematic, because it bypasses documented behavior [1] where a user should only have access to a change if they can see the destination ref. The same goes for other database references.",
    "root_cause": "Gerrit had two components for determining if a Git ref is visible to a user: (Default)RefFilter and PermissionBackend#ForRef. The latter only had logic to decide if a Git ref is visible according to the Gerrit READ permissions, which was not sufficient as it was unaware of Git tags and database references, bypassing access control for them.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect access control enforcement",
      "Exposure of sensitive information (non-visible refs)"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to git refs.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing database reference such as `refs/changes/xx/yyyyxx/meta`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An account with read permissions on some ref prefixes."
