|  | Hitron CODA-4582U 7.1.1.30 devices allow XSS via a Managed Device name on the > Wireless > Access Control > Add Managed Device screen. |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | Script can be stored in Database and execute every time when users visits it. If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. |
|  | Amongst other things, the attacker can: |
|  | 1) Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. |
|  | 2) View any information that the user is able to view. |
|  | 3) Modify any information that the user is able to modify. |
|  | 4) Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user. |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Vector: |
|  | To exploit this vulnerability user must visit the Add managed device and click on manage and it will trigger XSS payload. |
|  |  |
|  | POC: |
|  |  |
|  | When user adds the Managed Device to the Wireless - Access Control - Add Managed Device list, It asks for Device name and MAC address. |
|  | In-place of device's name, need to add XSS payload and click on Apply. |
|  |  |
|  | Payload is "/><script>&#97;lert(document.cookie)</script> |
|  | initially payload may not work so use payload <svg><script>&#97;lert(1)</script></svg> and remove svg tags and add "/> before the payload and save it again which will accept the payload |
|  | and when you click on manage, it will trigger payload. |
