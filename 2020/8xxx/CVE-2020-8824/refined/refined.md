{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Hitron CODA-4582U router firmware does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new managed device under Wireless Access Control. Specifically, the 'Device name' field allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser every time the user visits the page containing the injected script. This can lead to full compromise of the user's session, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the user, view/modify user's data, and initiate attacks that appear to originate from the victim.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the 'Device name' field when adding a managed device under Wireless > Access Control > Add Managed Device. The payload is stored in the router's database and executed when a user views the page listing managed devices and clicks manage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the router's management interface with sufficient privileges to modify wireless access control settings."
