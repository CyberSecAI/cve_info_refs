September 2020 Security Releases
## [*(Update 15-Sept-2020)* Security releases available](#update-15-sept-2020-security-releases-available)

Updates are now available for v10,x, v12.x and v14.x Node.js release lines for the following issues.

### [HTTP Request Smuggling due to CR-to-Hyphen conversion (High) (CVE-2020-8201)](#http-request-smuggling-due-to-cr-to-hyphen-conversion-high-cve-2020-8201)

Affected Node.js versions converted carriage returns in HTTP request headers to a hyphen before parsing. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling as it is a non-standard interpretation of the header.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 14.x and 12.x releases line

Thank you to Amit Klein who works at Safebreach for reporting this vulnerability.

### [Denial of Service by resource exhaustion CWE-400 due to unfinished HTTP/1.1 requests (Critical) (CVE-2020-8251)](#denial-of-service-by-resource-exhaustion-cwe-400-due-to-unfinished-http11-requests-critical-cve-2020-8251)

Node.js is vulnerable to HTTP denial of service (DOS) attacks based on delayed requests submission which can make the server unable to accept new connections. The fix a new http.Server option called requestTimeout
with a default value of 0 which means it is disabled by default. This should be set when Node.js is used as an edge server, for more details refer to the documentation.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 14.x release line

Thank you to Paolo Insogna and Matteo Collina who work at NearFom for reporting and fixing this vulnerability.

### [fs.realpath.native may cause buffer overflow (Medium) (CVE-2020-8252)](#fsrealpathnative-may-cause-buffer-overflow-medium-cve-2020-8252)

libuv's realpath implementation incorrectly determined the buffer size which can result in a buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.

Impacts:

* All versions of the 10.x release line
* All versions of the 12.x release line
* All versions of the 14.x release line before 14.9.0

Thank you Xiaoyi Shi who works at Tencent for reporting this vulnerability.

## [Downloads and release details](#downloads-and-release-details)

* [Node.js v10.22.1 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v10.22.1/)
* [Node.js v12.18.4 (LTS)](/en/blog/release/v12.18.4/)
* [Node.js v14.11.0 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v14.11.0/)

---

## [Summary](#summary)

The Node.js project will release new versions of all supported release lines on or shortly after Tuesday, September 15, 2020.
These releases will fix

* One critical severity issue
* One high severity issue
* One medium severity issue

## [Impact](#impact)

The 14.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one critical severity issue, one high severity issue and one medium severity issue.

The 12.x release line of Node.js is vulnerable to one high severity issue, and one medium severity issue.
