Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-8616:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient limitation on the number of fetches performed by BIND when processing referrals. Specifically, when a recursive resolver encounters an NS record without corresponding glue records, it initiates additional queries to find the IP address of the nameserver. This process, if not controlled, can lead to an excessive amount of queries. This is also referred to as "NXNSAttack".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of rate-limiting**: BIND does not adequately limit the number of fetches performed when processing referrals. The lack of proper rate-limiting on referral fetches allows for excessive query generation.
*   **Bypassable Exemptions:**  Older versions of BIND might have exemptions in place for root and TLD servers from certain recursion limits, allowing for those servers to be targeted. This also could lead to an excessive amount of queries.
*   **Missing Glue Records**: NS referral responses that lack glue records are exploited. This forces the vulnerable resolver to query the authoritative server to resolve the NS records IP address.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker can cause a vulnerable BIND server to issue an enormous amount of requests, potentially leading to performance degradation of the server itself.
*   **Reflection Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited to use the recursive resolver as an amplifier for a reflection attack against other target servers, resulting in a high amplification factor.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **DNS Queries with Crafted Referrals:** An attacker sends DNS queries that are specially crafted to force the BIND server to initiate a chain of referral queries.
*   **Authoritative DNS Server:** An attacker-controlled authoritative server sends responses with multiple NS records lacking glue records and unique subdomains to bypass caching.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control over an authoritative server:** The attacker needs to control an authoritative server to craft malicious responses.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send DNS queries to the vulnerable BIND server.
*   **Knowledge of Target DNS Servers**: An attacker needs to know the vulnerable servers to target with malicious requests.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple BIND versions, including 9.11.x, 9.14.x, and 9.16.x before certain patched releases.
*   The provided information indicates that fixes involve further limiting the number of queries triggered by a request, removing exemptions for root and TLD servers and limiting address records.
*   The vulnerability has a high CVSS score, highlighting the severity of the issue.
*   Some of the content highlights that this vulnerability is related to a larger class of attacks known as NXNSAttack and provides information about its amplification capabilities.
*   The Suse content notes that their versions of bind may be unaffected by this issue.
*   The openSUSE mailing list content shows that bind is updated to 9.16.6 to fix the issues.
*   The launchpad content shows the changes for Ubuntu include applying a patch to limit queries triggered by a request.
*   The openwall content contains the initial security advisory by ISC.
*  The Netapp content notes that they are aware of the public discussion, and lists affected Netapp products that use the vulnerable versions of BIND.
* The nlnetlabs content notes that they are not affected by this CVE.
