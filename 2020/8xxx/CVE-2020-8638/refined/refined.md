Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8638:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `testPlanUrgency.class.php` file, specifically within the `setTestUrgency` method. The `$urgency` parameter, received via the `$_REQUEST`, is directly embedded into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query executed against the database by injecting malicious SQL code through the `urgency` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Manipulation:** In PostgreSQL environments, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Modification of database records (e.g., changing user roles to gain administrative access).
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Denial of service by manipulating the database structure or data.
- **Data Exposure:** In MySQL environments, while stacked queries are not allowed, attackers can still extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., user credentials) via SQL injection. Although passwords are bcrypt hashed, API keys and cookies are stored in plain text, which can be used for session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the `planUrgency.php` script with a modified `urgency` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the web application and the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`planUrgency.php`).
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
- **(Optional) User account:** While a privileged user account is not necessary to exploit the vulnerability itself, it may be required to reach the specific feature in the application to inject SQL via the `urgency` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Testlink version 1.9.20.
- The provided content includes the source code of the vulnerable method as well as the fix.
- The provided content shows how to exploit the SQL Injection in both Postgres and MySQL databases.
- The fix implemented parameterization and type casting in the SQL query, mitigating the SQL Injection.
