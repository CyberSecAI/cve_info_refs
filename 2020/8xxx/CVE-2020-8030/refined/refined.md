Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `/tmp` directory by the `skuba` tool when joining a node to a cluster. Specifically, the `kubeadm-init.conf` file was being created in `/tmp` with insecure permissions (644), making it readable by all users. Additionally, the file was created with a static name, making it possible for an attacker to predict and potentially manipulate. The tool also does not check if the configuration file already exists in the tmp directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure Permissions:** The `kubeadm-init.conf` file, containing a bootstrap token, was created with world-readable permissions (644) in `/tmp`.
2.  **Static Filename:** The file was created with a predictable name (`/tmp/kubeadm-init.conf`), making it easier for an attacker to target.
3.  **Lack of temporary directory:** Instead of writing directly to /tmp, the tool should have created a temporary directory.
4.  **No checks for already existing files:** The tool does not verify if the `/tmp/kubeadm-init.conf` already exists and will overwrite it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** An attacker could read the `kubeadm-init.conf` file and obtain the bootstrap token, which can be used to impersonate the control-plane node during the bootstrapping process.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** By creating their own `kubeadm-init.conf` file in `/tmp` with specific configurations, an attacker could potentially manipulate the node joining process. This could lead to a compromised node joining as the control plane instead of a worker node.
*   **Control Plane Impersonation:** With the leaked token and network access, an attacker could potentially impersonate the control plane and perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the `skuba node bootstrap` or `skuba node join` command is being executed.
*   **Timing Attack:** The attacker needs to time the creation and modification of the `kubeadm-init.conf` file in `/tmp` with the execution of `skuba`.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker could overwrite the configuration file before the tool uses it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where skuba commands are run.
*   The attacker would need some timing capabilities to exploit the file creation/overwrite.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The initial report also mentioned a static name vulnerability for `/tmp/crio.conf.d`, but this was not further pursued as a CVE.
*   The fix involves creating a temporary, randomly named directory in the remote machine and copying the configuration files to it. This prevents name collisions and mitigates timing attacks, as well as adding additional checks for existing files.
*   The provided information includes an internal Critical Release Date (CRD) of 2021-01-04 or earlier.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in the SUSE-SU-2020:3761-1 update.
