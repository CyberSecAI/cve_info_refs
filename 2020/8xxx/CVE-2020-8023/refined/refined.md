Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-8023:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the OpenLDAP configuration allowing the `ldap` user to modify the database directory configuration and the subsequent use of `chown -R` on the database directory during the `slapd` service startup. Specifically, when `OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="ldap"` is set, the `ldap` user can modify the `olcdbdirectory` setting to point to a different location. On service restart, a `chown -R` command is executed on that directory, which can lead to privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insecure use of `chown -R`:** The `slapd` startup script uses `chown -R` on a directory based on user-controlled configuration when `OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="ldap"` is set.
2.  **Writable LDAP configuration:** The `ldap` user can modify the directory where the database is stored.
3.  **Unprotected /etc/passwd modifications:** The system allows writing a new user with a password hash directly to `/etc/passwd` and then use it with `su`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user with the privileges of the `ldap` user can escalate to `root`. By modifying the `olcdbdirectory` to a location they control (e.g., `/etc2`), the subsequent `chown -R` command executed by the service startup script changes the ownership of the files within that directory to `ldap:ldap`.  If the attacker places a new user with a password hash into the /etc/passwd, that attacker can then escalate to root using the new user.
*   **File disclosure:** Although less severe, changing the ownership of sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` or `/etc/passwd` to `ldap:ldap` could lead to information disclosure. While some applications might refuse to function without `root:root` ownership on such files, the issue is still a vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Compromise the ldap user:** An attacker who has obtained the privileges of the `ldap` user can exploit this vulnerability. This could be achieved by exploiting another vulnerability within the `slapd` daemon itself.
2.  **Modify LDAP Database configuration:** An attacker could directly modify the LDAP configuration if they have access to the LDAP directory as an admin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **`ldap` User Privileges:** The attacker must be able to execute commands with the privileges of the `ldap` user or have the ability to modify the LDAP database as an admin.
*   **`OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND` set to `ldap`:** The system must have the `OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND` option set to `ldap`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenLDAP configurations that use the LDAP backend for configuration (`OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="ldap"`).
*   The fix involves removing the `chown -R` call on the database directory during service startup.
*   The issue is acknowledged as a privilege escalation, and not just file disclosure, due to the ability to create a new root user.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple SUSE Linux Enterprise versions and openSUSE Leap.
