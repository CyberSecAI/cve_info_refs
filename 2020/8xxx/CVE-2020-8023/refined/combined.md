| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 07:19:56 UTC  ``` When OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="ldap" is set the ldap user can escalate to root.  POC: as root $ grep OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND= /etc/sysconfig/openldap OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND="ldap" $ cp -r /etc /etc2  as ldap: sh-5.0$ id uid=76(ldap) gid=70(ldap) groups=70(ldap) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0 sh-5.0$ pwd /etc/openldap/slapd.d sh-5.0$ cat olcDatabase olcdbdirectory /etc2  as root: $ systemctl restart slapd $ ls -la /etc2/passwd -rw-r--r--. 1 ldap ldap 2848 Jun  9 08:56 /etc2/passwd  Also an issue (but not covered by the CVE): On systems with fs.protected_hardlinks=0 the call to chown -R in chown_database_dirs can be exploited since /var/lib/ldap belongs to ldap and chown -R is called there by default. Please remove the chown -R call ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 07:22:17 UTC  ``` This issue will be handled according to our disclosure policy outlined in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_disclosure_policy](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ASecurity_disclosure_policy)  In accordance with our policy we will make this issue public latest at Internal CRD: 2020-09-07 or earlier  This is the latest possible date and we prefer to make it public earlier if the situation allows it. You can make it public whenever you like since this is an internal finding. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-09 07:26:37 UTC  ``` Affected all the way down to 11-SP1 (there start is called rc.ldap) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c3)  William Brown   2020-06-10 01:15:58 UTC  ``` Okay, to confirm as "all the way down to 11-SP1" isn't really clear to me ...  This affects the following ibs repos:  [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-15:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-15%3AUpdate/openldap2)  [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-12-SP2%3AUpdate/openldap2)  [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-12%3AUpdate/openldap2) [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-11-SP3%3AUpdate/openldap2)  [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-11-SP1%3AUpdate/openldap2)   Is this correct to your understanding of the issue? Are there any I have missed?   I want to confirm what is the vulnerability here because it's not clear from your POC.  We have:  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4612 Jun 10 01:03 /etc/sysconfig/openldap  When *root* has modified this to use "OPENLDAP_CONFIG_BACKEND", this means that the slapd daemon (which runs as ldap, an isolated service account it appears), if a user was able to become ldap (how?) OR the openldap directory manager (equivalent to root but in ldap) is able to change olcdbdirectory to another value, then on restart of the openldap instance the start script call to "chown_database_dirs_bconfig", a chown -R is called on the location, which can change the permissions of other files such as /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd.   So to be clear, the "fix" from your perspective is to remove the call to chown_database_dirs_bconfig()?  I think this won't affect slapd.conf directory chown, because it's root:ldap and ldap is group readonly, but it's probably worth removing chown_database_dirs() as well.  Does this seem correct to you? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c4)  William Brown   2020-06-10 01:44:29 UTC  ``` I'm thinking about this more, are you sure this is a priv esc? It seem like a file disclosure as the most. This can cause root:root files to be changed to ldap:ldap, but most services like sudoers, shadow, sssd will all refuse to run once they are not root:root as their config files. Can you elaborate here on how this could get you to a root shell from changing to ldap:ldap on a file?   I still think the chown on startup is a bit poor, so I agree it should be fixed, but I'd really like to see some more detail about how this is a priv esc thank you :) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-10 09:09:50 UTC  ``` > [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-15:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-15%3AUpdate/openldap2) > [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12-SP2:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-12-SP2%3AUpdate/openldap2) > [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-12:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-12%3AUpdate/openldap2) > [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-11-SP3:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-11-SP3%3AUpdate/openldap2) > [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:Update/openldap2](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3ASLE-11-SP1%3AUpdate/openldap2) > > Is this correct to your understanding of the issue?

For example by exploiting the slapd daemon. That's not really part of the question here.

I was under the impression that passwd was never able to store hashes, and that it was permission checked to be root:root ... but apparently I'm wrong.  would that also potentially be an issue? Shouldn't the nss compat/files module refuse to use a hash from /etc/passwd, and it should refuse to work if the permissions aren't root:root? That seems like an extra "defence in depth" that would be valuable to have (consider say sssd.conf which refuses to start if it's not root:root 600, which would actually mitigate this attack pattern).   Anyway, I'm still going to fix the chown, thanks for your time. I'll put in the requests today I hope. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1172698#c9)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-06-29 07:38:36 UTC  ``` All codestream but SLE11-SP1 are ready for release.
