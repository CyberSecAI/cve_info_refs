Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-8619:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how ISC BIND handles an asterisk character within an empty non-terminal entry. This can lead to an assertion failure within the `rbtdb.c` file when a nameserver is providing authoritative service for one or more zones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Assertion failure due to the presence of an asterisk in a specific DNS record.
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This is because the vulnerability causes the BIND server to crash due to the assertion failure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- The attacker needs the ability to change zone content (e.g. being an authorized DNS administrator).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject a specifically crafted record into the zone content that contains an empty non-terminal entry with an asterisk.
- In the case of off-path attacks, attacker needs the ability to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed request was sent and spoof a truncated response with specific characteristics.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in ISC BIND versions 9.11.4 prior to 9.11.20, 9.11.4-S1 prior to 9.11.20-S1, 9.14.9 through 9.14.12 and 9.16.0 prior to 9.16.4.
- NetApp states that it is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability
- SUSE states that their currently released bind versions are not affected by this problem
- Red Hat's bugzilla tracking this issue mentions "An asterisk character in an empty non-terminal can cause an assertion failure in rbtdb.c".
- There's a mention of `rbtdb.c` being the specific file where the assertion failure is triggered in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry.
- The vulnerability is considered a medium-severity issue with a CVSS v3 score of 4.9 (medium).
