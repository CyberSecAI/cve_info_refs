**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Incorrect membership handling within the group sharing feature of GitLab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control when sharing a group with another group. This could lead to unauthorized users gaining access to projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Unauthorized users could gain access to projects they should not have access to, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the group sharing functionality by sharing a group with another group.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to have some level of access to a GitLab instance to exploit this vulnerability, specifically the ability to perform group sharing actions. The attacker would need to be able to share a group with another group, and the vulnerability would then grant project access to unauthorized users within the shared group.

**Additional Notes**
The vulnerability affects GitLab CE/EE versions 12.5.0 and later.  The issue was mitigated in versions 12.7.6, 12.6.7, and 12.5.10.
