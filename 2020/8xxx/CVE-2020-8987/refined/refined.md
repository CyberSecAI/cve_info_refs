Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
Avast AntiTrack and AVG AntiTrack intercept HTTPS traffic by acting as a proxy. They install their own root certificate on the user's machine and then generate certificates for websites visited. The primary issue is the failure of the AntiTrack software to properly validate certificates presented by the end web servers it is connecting to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of End Server Certificate Validation:** The software does not check the validity of certificates from the actual web servers, allowing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to use self-signed certificates or other invalid certificates without the software detecting or alerting to it.
*   **TLS Downgrade:** The software downgrades the connection to TLS 1.0, even if the browser and the web server support higher versions. This makes the connection more vulnerable.
*   **Weak Cipher Suites:** The software uses older and weaker cipher suites, ignoring browser settings and preventing the use of forward secrecy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept all HTTPS traffic, see what users are browsing, including passwords, and session cookies, even when secure sites are being accessed.
*   **Credentials Theft:** Captured credentials can be reused by the attacker.
*   **Session Hijacking:** If 2FA is used, attackers can hijack live sessions by cloning session cookies after a user logs in.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Confidential communications and data can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Proxy:** An attacker sets up a malicious proxy server.
*   **DNS Poisoning:** The attacker can manipulate DNS responses to direct the victim to a malicious web server controlled by the attacker.
*   **MITM Position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept the victim's internet traffic such as an attacker on the same network or ISP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the victim's network traffic. This could be on the same network as the victim (e.g., a public Wi-Fi network), or via a compromised internet service provider, or other means for intercepting and forwarding network traffic.
*   **Malicious Infrastructure:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious site with a self-signed certificate and a proxy server to intercept and forward the user's network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Avast AntiTrack versions below 1.5.1.172 and AVG AntiTrack versions below 2.0.0.178.
*   The issue does not require any special configuration or action by the victim using the software in default configuration.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the victim's computer.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Avast on August 7, 2019, and publicly disclosed on March 9, 2020, after the fix was released.

This vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attack by exploiting the lack of certificate validation of end web servers and the downgrade of TLS connections, making HTTPS traffic vulnerable to interception, credential theft, and session hijacking.
