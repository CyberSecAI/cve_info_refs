# Avast AntiTrack does not check validity of end web server certificates

A man-in-the-middle attack on HTTPS traffic is made possible by Avast AntiTrack. Basically -
someone outside your home or workplace can see what you are browsing, including passwords you use, even on
secure sites.

**9 March 2020**

The consequences are hard to overstate. A remote attacker running a malicious proxy could capture their victim's
HTTPS traffic and record credentials for later re-use. If a site needs two factor authentication (such as a
one-time password), then the attacker can still hijack a live session by cloning session cookies after the victim
logs in.

No special action is necessary by the victim using Avast AntiTrack in its default configuration. And the attacker
does not need access to the victim's machine.

**Disclosure Date:** 9 March 2020

**CVE:** [CVE-2020-8987](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8987)

**Affected Product(s):** Avast AntiTrack below 1.5.1.172, AVG AntiTrack below 2.0.0.178.

**Vendor:** Avast

**Vendor acknowledgement:** [Researcher David Eade reports AntiTrack bug to Avast](https://www.avast.com/hacker-hall-of-fame/en/researcher-david-eade-reports-antitrack-bug-to-avast)

Avast Antitrack and AVG AntiTrack share core code. This report
refers to Avast AntiTrack but applies equally to both products.

## In depth

During installation, Avast AntiTrack adds a certificate (named
"AvastAntiTrack 2") to the Windows "Trusted Root Certification
Authorities" store.

> "By default, the Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store is configured with a
> set of public CAs that has met the requirements of the Microsoft Root Certificate Program."

Microsoft <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/trusted-root-certification-authorities-certificate-store>

Avast AntiTrack then proxies its users' traffic to HTTPS sites and
presents the browser with a freshly minted certificate of its own for
each site visited. The browser displays a secure padlock icon, but importantly **traffic is not secured to the
end web server**.

Three issues were reported to Avast.

### Issue 1

**Avast AntiTrack does not check the validity of certificates presented by the end web server.** This makes it
trivial for a man-in-the-middle to serve a fake site using a self-signed certificate.

This was confirmed by capturing a victim's DNS requests on port 53 and responding with a "malicious" IP address
for certain queries. The "malicious" web server was configured with a self-signed certificate for www.avast.com.
Ordinarily this should not work for HTTPS traffic (because the browser would warn of an invalid certificate
authority), but Avast AntiTrack's proxy ignores the certificate problem and mints its own certificate to present
to the victim (that is trusted by the victim's browser due to the entry in their Trusted Root Certification
Authorities store).

### Issue 2

**Avast AntiTrack downgrades the browser's security protocol to TLS 1.0.**

Internet Explorer and Edge can be configured to use only TLS 1.2 or higher. Ordinarily this should mean these
browser cannot reach websites using lower versions of TLS. However, Avast AntiTrack ignores this setting and makes
connections with TLS 1.0 regardless (if the web server supports it), even if the web server supports TLS 1.2 too.

### Issue 3

**Browser cipher suites are not honoured and Avast AntiTrack's chosen cipher suites do not support Forward
Secrecy.**

Microsoft periodically updates the cipher suites available to Internet Explorer and Edge. These are ignored by
Avast AntiTrack in favour of much older ciphers, considered weak by today's standards.
