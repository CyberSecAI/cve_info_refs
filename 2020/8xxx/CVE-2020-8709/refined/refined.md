Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper authentication in socket services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Lack of proper authentication mechanisms in the socket services of affected Intel server boards, systems, and compute modules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** An unauthenticated attacker can potentially elevate their privileges on the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly stated, the CVSS vector indicates some potential for information disclosure (C:N, but with an adjacent scope).
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The CVSS vector indicates some potential for denial of service (A:L).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via adjacent access, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have some kind of network proximity to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected server board, system, or compute module, being on the same local network or having a similar level of network adjacency.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel(R) Server Boards, Server Systems and Compute Modules before version 2.45.
*   The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is 6.1 (Medium), with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L.
* The NetApp advisory confirms that some of their products that incorporate affected Intel technologies are vulnerable and refer to the INTEL-SA-00384 advisory for more details. NetApp does not plan to address this vulnerability in NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage.
