{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Backblaze client's service process, bzserv, executes bztransmit to download client updates. The bztransmit process does not properly verify or update the ACL/permissions of the bzupdates directory, which is used to store downloaded client updates.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions/ACLs on the bzupdates directory.",
      "Lack of verification of directory permissions/ACLs before downloading and executing updates.",
      "Reliance on insecure ShellExecute() and system() for executing downloaded updates."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM/root. An attacker can overwrite the downloaded update executable with a malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker creates the bzupdates directory before Backblaze installation or before bztransmit creates it. This allows the attacker to control the directory's permissions/ACLs.",
      "Attacker replaces the downloaded update executable with their own malicious executable."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local unprivileged access to the system is sufficient to perform this attack."
  }
