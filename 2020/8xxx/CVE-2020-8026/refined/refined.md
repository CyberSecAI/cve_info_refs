Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from incorrect default file permissions within the `inn` (InterNetNews) package in openSUSE. Specifically, many files in `/usr/lib/news` were owned by the `news` user and group instead of `root`.
- Additionally, a user-changeable binary (`innupgrade`) was called within the packaging's `%post` section, which is executed as the `news` user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect File Ownership:** A large number of executable files and scripts within `/usr/lib/news` were incorrectly owned by the `news` user. This allows the `news` user or any user able to gain control over the `news` user account, to modify these files.
- **Packaging Script Vulnerability:**  The `innupgrade` binary, located in `/usr/lib/news/bin/`, is called during package installation/upgrade. Since the binary is owned by the `news` user, this could be modified to execute arbitrary code by a malicious actor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker who controls the `news` user could modify the files and scripts to inject malicious code.
- **Root Access:** By modifying the `innupgrade` binary, an attacker could potentially gain root privileges during the packaging process when this binary gets executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Control of `news` User:** The attacker needs to gain control over the `news` user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a user on the affected system.
- **Compromised `news` User:** The attacker needs to compromise the `news` user account, or any account that has write access to files owned by the `news` user. This would allow them to modify files, including the binary called during the package post-install phase.

**Summary of the fix:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the ownership of the files in `/usr/lib/news` to `root` to prevent the `news` user from modifying them, thus preventing privilege escalation by modifying the binary.
