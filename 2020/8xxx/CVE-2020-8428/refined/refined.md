   "summary": "CVE-2020-8428 is a use-after-free vulnerability present in the VFS layer of the Linux kernel, specifically in the `may_create_in_sticky` function, that can be triggered through local access by manipulating file system operations. This vulnerability could result in a denial of service (system crash) or, potentially, in sensitive information disclosure by reading kernel memory. The root cause of the vulnerability is that the reference to the parent directory, a struct dentry, was dropped before accessing its `i_mode` and `i_uid` attributes. The fix ensures these are accessed before the directory reference is dropped. Various Linux distributions were affected, necessitating patches for versions including 4.19 through 5.5.x of the kernel"
