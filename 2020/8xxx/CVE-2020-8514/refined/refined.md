```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input when renaming folders. Specifically, it allows the use of angle brackets, which are interpreted as HTML tags when the folder name is displayed in the web interface after the rename function is invoked.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Code execution and escalation of privileges",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a folder name that includes a JavaScript payload, such as `<img src=/ onerror=alert(0);>`, and then invoking the rename folder functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create folders on the server and invoke the rename function. This suggests they would likely need to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to create folders within the application."
