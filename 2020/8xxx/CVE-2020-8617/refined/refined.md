## Analysis of CVE-2020-8617

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A logic error exists in the code of BIND that checks TSIG (Transaction Signature) validity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how BIND handles responses to TSIG-signed requests. Specifically, when receiving a TSIG BADTIME response and replaying it as a request, it can trigger an assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the BIND server crashes due to the triggered assertion failure.
*   Some sources mention that while a crash is the most immediate effect, other attacks could potentially be carried out, depending on the pre-existing conditions of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, leveraging the DNS protocol.
*   An attacker needs to send a specifically crafted message to the server via a TCP connection.
*   Some sources specify that the attacker needs to know the TSIG key used by the server or successfully guess its name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the targeted server.
*   The attacker requires the ability to send a specially-crafted DNS message.
*   The attacker may require knowledge of (or guess) a valid TSIG key used by the target server.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by limiting the number of queries, including from root and TLD servers, and limiting the number of address records to 4 for any domain (Suse).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in BIND versions 9.11.19, 9.14.12, and 9.16.3 (ISC).
*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate or important in severity.
*   Several patches have been made available for different Linux distributions.
*   Some sources suggest that most BIND servers are vulnerable because they configure a local session key even when not explicitly required.

**Additional notes:**

*   Some content is related to CVE-2020-8616, CVE-2020-8618, CVE-2020-8619, CVE-2020-8620, CVE-2020-8621, CVE-2020-8622, CVE-2020-8623, CVE-2020-8624, CVE-2017-3136, CVE-2018-5741 and CVE-2019-6477, which were fixed in the same security updates, but are not directly related to CVE-2020-8617.
*  The advisory from NetApp also mentions CVE-2020-8616 being fixed in conjunction with CVE-2020-8617.
