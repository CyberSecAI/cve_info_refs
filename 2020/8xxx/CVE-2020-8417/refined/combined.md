## Description

**‚úÇ Code Snippets** provides an effortless way to enhance your WordPress site.

**üöÄ Upgrade to Code Snippets Pro** for complete CSS, JavaScript, Gutenberg, Elementor and cloud synchronisation integrations. **[Elevate your snippets experience now!](https://codesnippets.pro/pricing)**

Say goodbye to the hassle of tweaking your theme‚Äôs `functions.php` file and downloading endless plugins ‚Äì Code Snippets simplifies the process!

A snippet is like a mini-plugin for your WordPress site, providing added functionality without the clutter.

‚òÅÔ∏è Each copy of Code Snippets includes full integration with the community-powered [Code Snippets Cloud](https://codesnippets.cloud/) platform, providing easy access to hundreds of tweaks and enhancements ready to power-up any WordPress site.

## FAQ

A full list of our Frequently Asked Questions can be found at [help.codesnippets.pro](https://help.codesnippets.pro/collection/3-faq).

### How can I recover my site if it is crashed by a buggy snippet?

You can recover your site by enabling the Code Snippets safe mode feature. Instructions for how to turn it on are available here: <https://help.codesnippets.pro/article/12-safe-mode>.

### Will I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress?

No, the snippets are stored in the WordPress database, independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.

### Can the plugin be completely uninstalled?

If you enable the ‚ÄòComplete Uninstall‚Äô option on the plugin settings page, Code Snippets will clean up all of its data when deleted through the WordPress ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu. This includes all stored snippets. If you would like to preserve the snippets, ensure they are exported first.

### Can I copy snippets that I have created to another WordPress site?

Yes! You can individually export a single snippet using the link below the snippet name on the ‚ÄòManage Snippets‚Äô page or bulk export multiple snippets using the ‚ÄòBulk Actions‚Äô feature. Snippets can later be imported using the ‚ÄòImport Snippets‚Äô page by uploading the export file.

### Can I export my snippets to PHP for a site where I‚Äôm not using the Code Snippets plugin?

Yes. Click the checkboxes next to the snippets you want to export, and then choose **Export to PHP** from the Bulk Actions menu and click Apply. The generated PHP file will contain the exported snippets‚Äô code, as well as their name and description in comments.

### Can I run network-wide snippets on a multisite installation?

You can run snippets across an entire multisite network by **Network Activating** Code Snippets through the Network Dashboard. You can also activate Code Snippets just on the main site, and then individually on other sites of your choice.

### Where are the snippets stored in my WordPress database?

Snippets are stored in the `wp_snippets` table in the WordPress database. The table name may differ depending on what your table prefix is set to.

### Where can I go for help or suggest new features?

You can get help with Code Snippets, report bugs or errors, and suggest new features and improvements either on the [WordPress Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/code-snippets) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/codesnippetspro/code-snippets).

### How can I help contribute to the development of the Code Snippets plugin?

The best way to do this is to fork the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/codesnippetspro/code-snippets) and send a pull request.

### How can I report security bugs found in this plugin?

You can report security bugs found in the source code of this plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/code-snippets). The Patchstack team will assist with verification, triage, and notification of security vulnerabilities.

### [Good, but some annoying deficiencies](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-but-some-annoying-deficiencies/)

Overall, I‚Äôm happy with this plugin, but in the ~3 months that I‚Äôve been using it I‚Äôve encountered two super annoying problems. First, it does not support the latest CSS syntax. Media queries such as @media (max-width: 1024px) { } will produce error messages even though that syntax is perfectly valid. I also get false errors when I use syntax such as .some-class-name:has(.another-class-name) { } even though that too is perfectly valid. For a paid plugin, I expect full support for the latest syntax. Instead, I got a support person who initially told me I was doing it wrong and only later admitted that this tool simply doesn‚Äôt support the newest syntactical goodies. The other annoyance is that the company is extremely slow to fix known bugs. Shortly after I started using this tool, I lost the ability to add or edit tags. The company admits this is a bug and even sent me the GitHub issue where they were tracking the fix. However, it‚Äôs been 6 weeks since the bug was identified and over a month since the Github issue was closed and the fix still hasn‚Äôt been released to production. Even accounting for the holidays, this seems too long. So this plugin is fine, but don‚Äôt expect full support for the latest code syntax or fast turn around times if you encounter any defects.

No plugin is perfect. There was an issue with a recent update to the plugin. The issue was quickly fixed by the plugin developers. Kudos to the team.

I use this Tool in every project. Together with ChatGPT, even someone like me with outdated PHP skills can integrate very useful functions into WordPress by myself.
