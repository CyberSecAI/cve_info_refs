Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-8034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, specifically the `dir` parameter in the HTTP GET request, when generating the breadcrumb output.
- This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the breadcrumb output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access a malicious URL.
- This could lead to various attacks such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially gaining access to the victim's webmail account.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `dir` parameter.
- The victim must be tricked into visiting the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into clicking/visiting the malicious URL.
- The attacker does not need to have prior access to the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "polict of Shielder".
- It affects Gollem versions prior to 3.0.13.
- The vulnerability is present in the browser functionality of Gollem and impacts the breadcrumb output.
- The fix is included in Gollem version 3.0.13.
- This vulnerability was also addressed in Debian by updating the `php-horde-gollem` package to version 3.0.3-2+deb8u1 for Debian 8 "Jessie".
