Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8895:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL hijacking within the Windows executable installer.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The installer is susceptible to DLL hijacking. This means a malicious DLL could be loaded by the installer instead of the legitimate one, due to how the installer searches for DLLs.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the installer process. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including, but not limited to, installing malware, modifying system settings, or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer would find it first (e.g., a directory in the DLL search order before the intended location of the DLL).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs write access to a directory that is searched by the installer for DLLs, and must be able to create a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one used by the installer. They also need to trick a user into running the vulnerable installer.
