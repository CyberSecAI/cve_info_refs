The provided content is related to CVE-2020-8811.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization validation during the profile picture upload process. The application does not properly verify if the user performing the upload is authorized to change the profile picture of the specified user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses user-supplied data (username) in the profile picture upload process without proper authorization checks, allowing an attacker to modify other users' profile pictures.
- **Missing Authorization:** The application fails to validate the permissions of the user performing the profile picture change, allowing a low-privileged user to modify the profile pictures of other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Profile Picture Manipulation:** Attackers can arbitrarily change profile pictures of other users including administrator accounts, potentially leading to impersonation, defacement, or social engineering attacks.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** The vulnerability also allows attackers to create files (profile pictures) in arbitrary directories beyond the intended profile picture folder.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the ability to upload arbitrary files in arbitrary directories could be leveraged for more significant attacks, depending on system configurations and available functionalities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request with the target user's username in the upload request parameters.
- A low-privileged authenticated user can make the request to change the profile picture of another user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account with the application to make the requests to change profile pictures.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges other than a valid account to exploit the vulnerability.
