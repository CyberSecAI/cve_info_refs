### vrend: Don't free resource struct in \_resource\_allocate\_texture

```

The structure is allocated outside this function and also deleted there
if texture creation failes or it is asserted that it doesn't fail
for intermediate blitting textures. Therefore, don't free the struct inside
this function when allocation fails.

Closes #154

(1) The struct holding the resource is allocated outside `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture`, and when the texture allocation itself fails, then this struct is freed after returning from that call (or for the intermediate blit texture it is asserted that texture allocation doesn't fail, because there it should never fail). Therefore, the struct must not be freed inside `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture`

(2) when one tries to launch a grid but no CS was sent before, then a null pointer dereference hit, this MR adds a test and fixes this.

Package        : virglrenderer
Version        : 0.7.0-2+deb10u1

Debian Bug     : 946942 949954 1009073

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in virglrenderer, a virtual
GPU for KVM virtualization.

CVE-2019-18388

    A NULL pointer dereference in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.0 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service via malformed
    commands.

CVE-2019-18389

    A heap-based buffer overflow in the vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov
    function in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service, or QEMU guest-to-host
    escape and code execution, via VIRGL_CCMD_RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE
    commands.

CVE-2019-18390

    An out-of-bounds read in the vrend_blit_need_swizzle function in
    vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows guest OS
    users to cause a denial of service via VIRGL_CCMD_BLIT commands.

CVE-2019-18391

    A heap-based buffer overflow in the vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov
    function in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service via
    VIRGL_CCMD_RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE commands.

CVE-2020-8002

    A NULL pointer dereference in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via commands that attempt
    to launch a grid without previously providing a Compute Shader (CS).

CVE-2020-8003

    A double-free vulnerability in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service by triggering texture
    allocation failure, because vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture is not an
    appropriate place for a free.

CVE-2022-0135

    An out-of-bounds write issue was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer
    (virglrenderer). This flaw allows a malicious guest to create a specially
    crafted virgil resource and then issue a VIRTGPU_EXECBUFFER ioctl, leading to a
    denial of service or possible code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.7.0-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your virglrenderer packages.

For the detailed security status of virglrenderer please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/virglrenderer>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
