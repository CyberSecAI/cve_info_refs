Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8003:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error in the `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture` function of virglrenderer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The resource struct is freed inside the `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture` function when texture allocation fails, but the struct is already freed after returning from that call. This results in a double-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this double-free vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by causing a texture allocation failure within the `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the virglrenderer that can cause texture allocation to fail.
- According to the Debian Security Advisory, this is typically done by a guest OS user in a virtualized environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a merge request that addresses the vulnerability by removing the redundant free call within `vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture`.
- The issue is tracked as issue #154 in the virglrenderer project.
