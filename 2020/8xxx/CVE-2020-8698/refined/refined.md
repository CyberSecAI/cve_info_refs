Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-8698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the "Improper isolation of shared resources" within some Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core issue is the lack of proper isolation of shared resources on the Intel System-on-a-Chip (SoC). This allows for potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to achieve information disclosure.
*   The impact is limited to data breaches. There is no mention of the possibility of privilege escalation or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in various Intel processors.
*   Multiple vendors (Siemens, NetApp, Fedora, Debian) have acknowledged the vulnerability and provided fixes through updates to affected products/systems.
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 5.5 (Medium) with the vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N which reflects the local access requirement, low attack complexity, and information disclosure.
*   CWE-1189: Improper Isolation of Shared Resources on System-on-a-Chip (SoC) is the relevant CWE.
