    "match": true,
    "information": [
      {
        "type": "description",
        "value": "There is a vulnerability in ActiveStorage's S3 adapter that allows the Content-Length of a direct file upload to be modified by an end user."
      },
       {
          "type": "root cause",
          "value": "The vulnerability stems from the ActiveStorage's S3 adapter allowing the `Content-Length` of a direct file upload to be modified by the end user."
        },
      {
        "type": "weaknesses",
        "value": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the `Content-Length` header in direct file uploads to S3 via ActiveStorage's S3 adapter."
      },
        {
          "type": "impact",
          "value": "An attacker can bypass server-side controls designed to limit upload size by manipulating the Content-Length header. This allows an attacker to upload files larger than what is permitted, potentially leading to resource exhaustion, service disruption, or other forms of abuse."
        },
      {
        "type": "attack vector",
        "value": "The attack vector involves manipulating the Content-Length header during a direct file upload to S3."

      {
        "type": "attacker capabilities",
         "value": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate a direct file upload via the ActiveStorage S3 adapter and have the ability to modify HTTP headers, specifically the `Content-Length` header. This implies the attacker is a user of the application."
