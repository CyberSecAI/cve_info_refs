{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of user-supplied MAC address input within the Pi-hole Web interface (AdminLTE). A crafted MAC address can inject code that will be executed by the web server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution can be achieved by an authenticated user by injecting malicious code via a crafted DHCP static lease.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface",
      "DHCP static lease configuration"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user with privileges to configure DHCP static leases via the web interface."
