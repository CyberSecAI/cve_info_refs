- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of junctions in Bitdefender Antivirus Free.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A vulnerability exists in how Bitdefender Antivirus Free manages junctions. This allows an unprivileged user to manipulate quarantined files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can substitute a quarantined file and restore it to a privileged location. This can lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires local access to the system and involves manipulating quarantined files through junctions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user on the affected system. The attacker must also be able to manipulate quarantined files and restore them via junctions. They also require user interaction.
