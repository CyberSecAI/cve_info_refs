Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-8169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper URL encoding of credentials (username and password) when set through libcurl's `curl_easy_setopt` options (specifically `CURLOPT_USERPWD`, `CURLOPT_USERNAME`, and `CURLOPT_PASSWORD`).  When a relative redirect occurs, libcurl constructs a full absolute URL, and due to the missing encoding, a part of the password could be misinterpreted as part of the hostname during the re-parsing of the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper URL encoding:** libcurl fails to URL encode the user credentials set via `curl_easy_setopt` before constructing the full URL during a relative redirect.
*   **Incorrect URL parsing:** The flawed URL construction leads to incorrect parsing of the URL components, misinterpreting a portion of the password as part of the hostname.
*   **Information Leakage:** The misparsed hostname, which includes part of the password, is then used in a DNS lookup, potentially exposing sensitive data (partial password) to DNS servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Partial Password Leakage:** An attacker can potentially leak a portion of the password through DNS queries. The portion of the password leaked is determined by the position of the `@` symbol in the password. While an observer cannot determine how much of the password was leaked, it provides enough information for an attacker to potentially guess the full password.
*   **DNS Server Exposure:** The leaked password can be exposed to the DNS server(s) used by the vulnerable system.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although the primary impact is information disclosure, the leaked credentials can be used for further attacks if the credentials are valid for a target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is triggered when libcurl is used to access an HTTP resource, and there's a relative redirect. The vulnerable libcurl versions need to be used with `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` enabled.
*  The password needs to contain the `@` character

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle/Malicious Server:** The attacker needs to control the server that issues the relative redirect or be in a position to observe the DNS queries of the vulnerable client.
*   **Password containing @:** The password being used by libcurl must include an `@` symbol in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
* The vulnerability affects libcurl versions 7.62.0 up to and including 7.70.0
* The issue was inadvertently fixed and pushed to the public source before the security impact was realized.
* The impact of this flaw is reduced if DNS-over-HTTPS is used as the data is then only observable by the DoH server.
