## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

* upstream: added [upstream\_cx\_pool\_overflow](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#config-cluster-manager-cluster-stats) for the connection pool circuit breaker.
* upstream: an EDS management server can now force removal of a host that is still passing active
  health checking by first marking the host as failed via EDS health check and subsequently removing
  it in a future update. This is a mechanism to work around a race condition in which an EDS
  implementation may remove a host before it has stopped passing active HC, thus causing the host
  to become stranded until a future update.
* upstream: added [an option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-commonlbconfig-ignore-new-hosts-until-first-hc)
  that allows ignoring new hosts for the purpose of load balancing calculations until they have
  been health checked for the first time.
* upstream: added runtime error checking to prevent setting dns type to STRICT\_DNS or LOGICAL\_DNS when custom resolver name is specified.
* upstream: added possibility to override fallback\_policy per specific selector in [subset load balancer](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/subsets#arch-overview-load-balancer-subsets).
* upstream: the [logical DNS cluster](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/service_discovery#arch-overview-service-discovery-types-logical-dns) now
  displays the current resolved IP address in admin output instead of 0.0.0.0.

## 1.10.0 (Apr 5, 2019)[¶](#apr-5-2019 "Permalink to this headline")

* access log: added a new flag for upstream retry count exceeded.
* access log: added a [gRPC filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-accesslog-v2-grpcstatusfilter) to allow filtering on gRPC status.
* access log: added a new flag for stream idle timeout.
* access log: added a new field for upstream transport failure reason in [file access logger](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/observability/access_log#config-access-log-format-upstream-transport-failure-reason) and
  [gRPC access logger](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/data/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#envoy-api-field-data-accesslog-v2-accesslogcommon-upstream-transport-failure-reason) for HTTP access logs.

  discoverability in Docker Hub. Additionally, we now build images for point releases.
* config: added support of using google.protobuf.Any in opaque configs for extensions.
* config: logging warnings when deprecated fields are in use.
* config: removed deprecated –v2-config-only from command line config.

* ext\_authz: migrated from v2alpha to v2 and improved the documentation.
* ext\_authz: authorization request and response configuration has been separated into two distinct objects: [authorization request](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-httpservice-authorization-request) and [authorization response](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-httpservice-authorization-response). In addition, [client headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-authorizationresponse-allowed-client-headers) and [upstream headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-authorizationresponse-allowed-upstream-headers) replaces the previous *allowed\_authorization\_headers* object.

  [statistics](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/fault_filter#config-http-filters-fault-injection-stats) for the number of active faults
  and the number of faults the overflowed.
* fault: added [response rate limit](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-fault-v2-httpfault-response-rate-limit) fault injection.
* fault: added [HTTP header fault configuration](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/fault_filter#config-http-filters-fault-injection-http-header) to the HTTP fault filter.
* governance: extending Envoy deprecation policy from 1 release (0-3 months) to 2 releases (3-6 months).

* http: added modifyDecodingBuffer/modifyEncodingBuffer to allow modifying the buffered request/response data.
* http: added encodeComplete/decodeComplete. These are invoked at the end of the stream, after all data has been encoded/decoded respectively. Default implementation is a no-op.
* outlier\_detection: added support for [outlier detection event protobuf-based logging](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/outlier#arch-overview-outlier-detection-logging).
* mysql: added a MySQL proxy filter that is capable of parsing SQL queries over MySQL wire protocol. Refer to [MySQL proxy](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mysql_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mysql-proxy) for more details.
* performance: new buffer implementation (disabled by default; to test it, add “–use-libevent-buffers 0” to the command-line arguments when starting Envoy).

* zookeeper: added a ZooKeeper proxy filter that parses ZooKeeper messages (requests/responses/events).
  Refer to [ZooKeeper proxy](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/zookeeper_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-zookeeper-proxy) for more details.
* upstream: added configuration option to select any host when the fallback policy fails.
* upstream: stopped incrementing upstream\_rq\_total for HTTP/1 conn pool when request is circuit broken.

## 1.9.1 (Apr 2, 2019)[¶](#apr-2-2019 "Permalink to this headline")

* listeners: all listener filters are now governed by the [listener\_filters\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-listener-filters-timeout) setting. The hard coded 15s timeout in
  the [TLS inspector listener filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/listener_filters/tls_inspector#config-listener-filters-tls-inspector) is superseded by
  this setting.
* listeners: added the ability to match [FilterChain](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-listener-filterchain) using [source\_type](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-source-type).

  to specify whether the GrpcStatus status returned should be RESOURCE\_EXHAUSTED or
  UNAVAILABLE when a gRPC call is rate limited.
* rate-limit: removed support for the legacy ratelimit service and made the data-plane-api
  [rls.proto](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto#envoy-api-file-envoy-service-ratelimit-v2-rls-proto) based implementation default.
* rate-limit: removed the deprecated cluster\_name attribute in [rate limit service configuration](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto#envoy-api-file-envoy-config-ratelimit-v2-rls-proto).
* rate-limit: added [rate\_limit\_service](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/rate_limit/v2/rate_limit.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-http-rate-limit-v2-ratelimit) configuration to filters.
* rbac: added dynamic metadata to the network level filter.
* rbac: added support for permission matching by [requested server name](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/rbac/v2/rbac.proto#envoy-api-field-config-rbac-v2-permission-requested-server-name).
* redis: static cluster configuration is no longer required. Redis proxy will work with clusters
  delivered via CDS.
* router: added ability to configure arbitrary [retriable status codes.](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-retrypolicy-retriable-status-codes)
* router: added ability to set attempt count in upstream requests, see [virtual host’s include request
  attempt count flag](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-virtualhost-include-request-attempt-count).
* router: added internal [grpc-retry-on](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-retry-grpc-on) policy.

  [port\_redirect](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-redirectaction-port-redirect) to define the respective
  scheme and port rewriting RedirectAction.
* router: when [max\_grpc\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-max-grpc-timeout)
  is set, Envoy will now add or update the grpc-timeout header to reflect Envoy’s expected timeout.
* router: per try timeouts now starts when an upstream stream is ready instead of when the request has
  been fully decoded by Envoy.
* router: added support for not retrying [rate limited requests](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-ratelimited). Rate limit filter now sets the [x-envoy-ratelimited](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-ratelimited)
  header so the rate limited requests that may have been retried earlier will not be retried with this change.
* router: added support for enabling upgrades on a [per-route](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-upgrade-configs) basis.

* stream: renamed the RequestInfo namespace to StreamInfo to better match
  its behaviour within TCP and HTTP implementations.
* stream: renamed perRequestState to filterState in StreamInfo.
* stream: added downstreamDirectRemoteAddress to StreamInfo.
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift rate limiter filter.
* tls: added ssl.curves.<curve>, ssl.sigalgs.<sigalg> and ssl.versions.<version> to
  [listener metrics](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/stats#config-listener-stats) to track TLS algorithms and versions in use.
* tls: added support for [client-side session resumption](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/auth/cert.proto#envoy-api-field-auth-upstreamtlscontext-max-session-keys).

* tls: removed support for ECDSA certificates with curves other than P-256.
* tls: removed support for RSA certificates with keys smaller than 2048-bits.
* tracing: added support to the Zipkin tracer for the [b3](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-b3) single header format.
* tracing: added support for [Datadog](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/observability/tracing#arch-overview-tracing) tracer.
* upstream: added [scale\_locality\_weight](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-lbsubsetconfig-scale-locality-weight) to enable
  scaling locality weights by number of hosts removed by subset lb predicates.
* upstream: changed how load calculation for [priority levels](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/priority#arch-overview-load-balancing-priority-levels) and [panic thresholds](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/panic_threshold#arch-overview-load-balancing-panic-threshold) interact. As long as normalized total health is 100% panic thresholds are disregarded.
* upstream: changed the default hash for [ring hash](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-msg-cluster-ringhashlbconfig) from std::hash to [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash).
* upstream: when using active health checking and STRICT\_DNS with several addresses that resolve
  to the same hosts, Envoy will now health check each host independently.

## 1.8.0 (Oct 4, 2018)[¶](#oct-4-2018 "Permalink to this headline")

* access log: added [response flag filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/accesslog/v2/accesslog.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-accesslog-v2-responseflagfilter)
  to filter based on the presence of Envoy response flags.

* config: v1 disabled by default. v1 support remains available until October via flipping –v2-config-only=false.
* config: v1 disabled by default. v1 support remains available until October via deprecated flag –allow-deprecated-v1-api.
* config: fixed stat inconsistency between xDS and ADS implementation. [update\_failure](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cds#config-cluster-manager-cds)
  stat is incremented in case of network failure and [update\_rejected](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cds#config-cluster-manager-cds) stat is incremented
  in case of schema/validation error.
* config: added a stat [connected\_state](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/overview/mgmt_server#management-server-stats) that indicates current connected state of Envoy with
  management server.
* ext\_authz: added support for configuring additional [authorization headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/ext_authz/v2/ext_authz.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-ext-authz-v2-authorizationrequest-headers-to-add)
  to be sent from Envoy to the authorization service.
* fault: added support for fractional percentages in [FaultDelay](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-fault-v2-faultdelay-percentage)
  and in [FaultAbort](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/fault/v2/fault.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-fault-v2-faultabort-percentage).
* grpc-json: added support for building HTTP response from
  [google.api.HttpBody](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/httpbody.proto).

* health\_check: added support for [health check event logging](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/health_checking#arch-overview-health-check-logging).
* health\_check: added [timestamp](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/data/core/v2alpha/health_check_event.proto#envoy-api-field-data-core-v2alpha-healthcheckevent-timestamp)
  to the [health check event](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/data/core/v2alpha/health_check_event.proto#envoy-api-msg-data-core-v2alpha-healthcheckevent) definition.
* health\_check: added support for specifying [custom request headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers)
  to HTTP health checker requests.
* http: added support for a [per-stream idle timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-idle-timeout). This applies at both [connection manager](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-stream-idle-timeout)
  and [per-route granularity](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-idle-timeout). The timeout
  defaults to 5 minutes; if you have other timeouts (e.g. connection idle timeout, upstream
  response per-retry) that are longer than this in duration, you may want to consider setting a
  non-default per-stream idle timeout.
* http: added upstream\_rq\_completed counter for [total requests completed](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_stats#config-cluster-manager-cluster-stats-dynamic-http) to dynamic HTTP counters.
* http: added downstream\_rq\_completed counter for [total requests completed](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/stats#config-http-conn-man-stats), including on a [per-listener basis](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/stats#config-http-conn-man-stats-per-listener).
* http: added generic [Upgrade support](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-upgrade-configs).
* http: better handling of HEAD requests. Now sending transfer-encoding: chunked rather than content-length: 0.
* http: fixed missing support for appending to predefined inline headers, e.g.
  *authorization*, in features that interact with request and response headers,
  e.g. [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-add). For example, a
  request header *authorization: token1* will appear as *authorization:
  token1,token2*, after having [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-add) with *authorization:
  token2* applied.
* http: response filters not applied to early error paths such as http\_parser generated 400s.
* http: restrictions added to reject *:*-prefixed pseudo-headers in [custom
  request headers](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers).
* http: [hpack\_table\_size](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/core/protocol.proto#envoy-api-field-core-http2protocoloptions-hpack-table-size) now controls
  dynamic table size of both: encoder and decoder.
* http: added support for removing request headers using [request\_headers\_to\_remove](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-request-headers-to-remove).
* http: added support for a [delayed close timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-delayed-close-timeout) to mitigate race conditions when closing connections to downstream HTTP clients. The timeout defaults to 1 second.
* jwt-authn filter: add support for per route JWT requirements.
* listeners: added the ability to match [FilterChain](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-listener-filterchain) using
  [destination\_port](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-destination-port) and
  [prefix\_ranges](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-prefix-ranges).

* lua: added [streamInfo():dynamicMetadata()](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/lua_filter#config-http-filters-lua-stream-info-dynamic-metadata-wrapper) API.
* network: introduced [sni\_cluster](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/sni_cluster_filter#config-network-filters-sni-cluster) network filter that forwards connections to the
  upstream cluster specified by the SNI value presented by the client during a TLS handshake.
* proxy\_protocol: added support for HAProxy Proxy Protocol v2 (AF\_INET/AF\_INET6 only).
* ratelimit: added support for [api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1/api/envoy/service/ratelimit/v2/rls.proto).
  Lyft’s reference implementation of the [ratelimit](https://github.com/lyft/ratelimit) service also supports the data-plane-api proto as of v1.1.0.
  Envoy can use either proto to send client requests to a ratelimit server with the use of the
  use\_data\_plane\_proto boolean flag in the ratelimit configuration.
  Support for the legacy proto source/common/ratelimit/ratelimit.proto is deprecated and will be removed at the start of the 1.9.0 release cycle.
* ratelimit: added [failure\_mode\_deny](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/rate_limit/v2/rate_limit.proto#envoy-api-msg-config-filter-http-rate-limit-v2-ratelimit) option to control traffic flow in
  case of rate limit service error.

* route checker: added v2 config support and removed support for v1 configs.
* router: added ability to set request/response headers at the [route.Route](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-route) level.
* stats: added [option to configure the DogStatsD metric name prefix](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/metrics/v2/stats.proto#envoy-api-field-config-metrics-v2-dogstatsdsink-prefix) to DogStatsdSink.
* tcp\_proxy: added support for [weighted clusters](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/tcp_proxy/v2/tcp_proxy.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-tcp-proxy-v2-tcpproxy-weighted-clusters).
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift routing, moved configuration to correct location
* thrift\_proxy: introduced thrift configurable decoder filters
* tls: implemented [Secret Discovery Service](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/security/secret#config-secret-discovery-service).
* tracing: added support for configuration of [tracing sampling](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-tracing).
* upstream: added configuration option to the subset load balancer to take locality weights into account when
  selecting a host from a subset.
* upstream: require opt-in to use the [x-envoy-original-dst-host](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-x-envoy-original-dst-host) header
  for overriding destination address when using the [Original Destination](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/original_dst#arch-overview-load-balancing-types-original-destination)
  load balancing policy.

  the current status of all clusters.
* admin: added [`GET /stats/prometheus`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#get--stats-prometheus "GET /stats/prometheus") as an alternative endpoint for getting stats in prometheus format.
* admin: added [/runtime\_modify endpoint](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-runtime-modify) to add or change runtime values.
* admin: mutations must be sent as POSTs, rather than GETs. Mutations include:
  [`POST /cpuprofiler`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#post--cpuprofiler "POST /cpuprofiler"), [`POST /healthcheck/fail`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#post--healthcheck-fail "POST /healthcheck/fail"), [`POST /healthcheck/ok`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#post--healthcheck-ok "POST /healthcheck/ok"),

* admin: removed /routes endpoint; route configs can now be found at the [/config\_dump endpoint](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-config-dump).
* buffer filter: the buffer filter can be optionally
  [disabled](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/buffer/v2/buffer.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-buffer-v2-bufferperroute-disabled) or
  [overridden](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/buffer/v2/buffer.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-buffer-v2-bufferperroute-buffer) with
  route-local configuration.
* cli: added –config-yaml flag to the Envoy binary. When set its value is interpreted as a yaml
  representation of the bootstrap config and overrides –config-path.
* cluster: added [option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-close-connections-on-host-health-failure)
  to close tcp\_proxy upstream connections when health checks fail.
* cluster: added [option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-drain-connections-on-host-removal) to drain
  connections from hosts after they are removed from service discovery, regardless of health status.
* cluster: fixed bug preventing the deletion of all endpoints in a priority
* debug: added symbolized stack traces (where supported)
* ext-authz filter: added support to raw HTTP authorization.

  to trigger health check response. Deprecated the endpoint option.
* http: filters can now optionally support
  [virtual host](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-virtualhost-per-filter-config),
  [route](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-route-per-filter-config), and

  [x-forwarded-client-cert](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-x-forwarded-client-cert) header.
* http: local responses to gRPC requests are now sent as trailers-only gRPC responses instead of plain HTTP responses.
  Notably the HTTP response code is always “200” in this case, and the gRPC error code is carried in “grpc-status”
  header, optionally accompanied with a text message in “grpc-message” header.
* http: added support for [via header](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-via)
  append.
* http: added a [configuration option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-network-http-connection-manager-v2-httpconnectionmanager-skip-xff-append)
  to elide *x-forwarded-for* header modifications.
* http: fixed a bug in inline headers where addCopy and addViaMove didn’t add header values when
  encountering inline headers with multiple instances.
* listeners: added [tcp\_fast\_open\_queue\_length](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-tcp-fast-open-queue-length) option.
* listeners: added the ability to match [FilterChain](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-listener-filterchain) using
  [application\_protocols](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/listener/listener_components.proto#envoy-api-field-listener-filterchainmatch-application-protocols)
  (e.g. ALPN for TLS protocol).

* listeners: removed restriction on all filter chains having identical filters.
* load balancer: added [weighted round robin](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/load_balancers#arch-overview-load-balancing-types-round-robin) support. The round robin
  scheduler now respects endpoint weights and also has improved fidelity across
  picks.
* load balancer: [locality weighted load balancing](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/subsets#arch-overview-load-balancer-subsets) is now supported.
* load balancer: ability to configure zone aware load balancer settings [through the API](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/cluster.proto#envoy-api-field-cluster-commonlbconfig-zone-aware-lb-config).

  to have better balance when operating in weighted mode.
* logger: added the ability to optionally set the log format via the [`--log-format`](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/cli#cmdoption-log-format) option.
* logger: all [logging levels](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-logging) can be configured
  at run-time: trace debug info warning error critical.
* rbac http filter: a [role-based access control http filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/rbac_filter#config-http-filters-rbac) has been added.
* router: the behavior of per-try timeouts have changed in the case where a portion of the response has
  already been proxied downstream when the timeout occurs. Previously, the response would be reset
  leading to either an HTTP/2 reset or an HTTP/1 closed connection and a partial response. Now, the
  timeout will be ignored and the response will continue to proxy up to the global request timeout.
* router: changed the behavior of [source IP routing](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-hashpolicy-connectionproperties-source-ip)
  to ignore the source port.
* router: added an [prefix\_match](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-headermatcher-prefix-match) match type
  to explicitly match based on the prefix of a header value.
* router: added an [suffix\_match](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-headermatcher-suffix-match) match type
  to explicitly match based on the suffix of a header value.
* router: added an [present\_match](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-headermatcher-present-match) match type
  to explicitly match based on a header’s presence.
* router: added an [invert\_match](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-headermatcher-invert-match) config option
  which supports inverting all other match types to match based on headers which are not a desired value.
* router: allow [cookie routing](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-msg-route-routeaction-hashpolicy-cookie) to
  generate session cookies.
* router: added START\_TIME as one of supported variables in [header
  formatters](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers).
* router: added a [max\_grpc\_timeout](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#envoy-api-field-route-routeaction-max-grpc-timeout)
  config option to specify the maximum allowable value for timeouts decoded from gRPC header field
  grpc-timeout.
* router: added a [configuration option](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/api-v2/config/filter/http/router/v2/router.proto#envoy-api-field-config-filter-http-router-v2-router-suppress-envoy-headers) to disable *x-envoy-*

## 1.3.0 (May 17, 2017)[¶](#may-17-2017 "Permalink to this headline")

* As of this release, we now have an official [breaking change policy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-change-policy). Note that there are numerous breaking configuration
  changes in this release. They are not listed here. Future releases will adhere to the policy and
  have clear documentation on deprecations and changes.
* Bazel is now the canonical build system (replacing CMake). There have been a huge number of
  changes to the development/build/test flow. See [/bazel/README.md](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//bazel/README.md) and
  [/ci/README.md](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/v1.13.1//ci/README.md) for more information.
* [Outlier detection](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/upstream/outlier#arch-overview-outlier-detection) has been expanded to include success
  rate variance, and all parameters are now configurable in both runtime and in the JSON
  configuration.
* TCP level listener and cluster connections now have configurable receive buffer
  limits at which point connection level back pressure is applied.
  Full end to end flow control will be available in a future release.
* [Redis health checking](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_hc#config-cluster-manager-cluster-hc) has been added as an active
  health check type. Full Redis support will be documented/supported in 1.4.0.
* [TCP health checking](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/upstream/cluster_manager/cluster_hc#config-cluster-manager-cluster-hc-tcp-health-checking) now supports a
  “connect only” mode that only checks if the remote server can be connected to without
  writing/reading any data.
* [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl) is now the only supported TLS provider.
  The default cipher suites and ECDH curves have been updated with more modern defaults for both
  listener and cluster connections.
* The header value match rate limit action has been expanded to include an expect
  match parameter.
* Route level HTTP rate limit configurations now do not inherit the virtual host level
  configurations by default. Use include\_vh\_rate\_limits to inherit the virtual host
  level options if desired.
* HTTP routes can now add request headers on a per route and per virtual host basis via the
  [request\_headers\_to\_add](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/headers#config-http-conn-man-headers-custom-request-headers) option.
* The [example configurations](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/install/ref_configs#install-ref-configs) have been refreshed to demonstrate the
  latest features.
* per\_try\_timeout\_ms can now be configured in
  a route’s retry policy in addition to via the [x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/router_filter#config-http-filters-router-x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms) HTTP header.
* HTTP virtual host matching now includes support for prefix wildcard domains (e.g., \*.lyft.com).
* The default for tracing random sampling has been changed to 100% and is still configurable in
  [runtime](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_conn_man/runtime#config-http-conn-man-runtime).
* HTTP tracing configuration has been extended to allow tags
  to be populated from arbitrary HTTP headers.
* The [HTTP rate limit filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/http/http_filters/rate_limit_filter#config-http-filters-rate-limit) can now be applied to internal,
  external, or all requests via the request\_type option.
* [Listener binding](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/listeners#config-listeners) now requires specifying an address field. This can be
  used to bind a listener to both a specific address as well as a port.
* The [MongoDB filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mongo_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mongo-proxy) now emits a stat for queries that
  do not have $maxTimeMS set.
* The [MongoDB filter](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/configuration/listeners/network_filters/mongo_proxy_filter#config-network-filters-mongo-proxy) now emits logs that are fully valid
  JSON.
* The CPU profiler output path is now configurable.
* A watchdog system has been added that can kill the server if a deadlock is detected.
* A [route table checking tool](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/install/tools/route_table_check_tool#install-tools-route-table-check-tool) has been added that can
  be used to test route tables before use.
* We have added an [example repo](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/extending/extending#extending) that shows how to compile/link a custom filter.
* Added additional cluster wide information related to outlier detection to the [/clusters
  admin endpoint](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface).
* Multiple SANs can now be verified via the verify\_subject\_alt\_name setting.
  Additionally, URI type SANs can be verified.
* HTTP filters can now be passed opaque configuration specified on a per route basis.
* By default Envoy now has a built in crash handler that will print a back trace. This behavior can
  be disabled if desired via the `--define=signal_trace=disabled` Bazel option.
* Zipkin has been added as a supported [tracing provider](/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/intro/arch_overview/observability/tracing#arch-overview-tracing).
* Numerous small changes and fixes not listed here.
