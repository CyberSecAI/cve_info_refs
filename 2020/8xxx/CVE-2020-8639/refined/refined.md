Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-8639:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload functionality within the Testlink application. Specifically, the `importType` parameter, used in the keyword import feature, is not properly sanitized, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `importType` parameter in the `keywordsImport.php` file allows an attacker to control the destination path when uploading a file. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can specify arbitrary directories on the server to upload files, leading to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application uses the `move_uploaded_file()` function with a destination path controlled by the attacker (`$args->dest`). This allows uploading any type of file, without restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP webshell) to a writable location, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `keywordsImport.php` script with a malicious value for `importType` and a malicious file in the `uploadedFile` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Testlink application with the ability to import keywords.
*   The attacker needs to know a writable path on the server file system, where the user that executes the PHP code has write permissions.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `init_args` method in `keywordsImport.php` retrieves the `importType` parameter from the request, which is then used to construct the destination path for the uploaded file.
*   The `move_uploaded_file()` function is used to move the uploaded file to the attacker-controlled location.
*   The vulnerability was found in Testlink version 1.9.20.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by applying a whitelist to the `importType` parameter.
*   The fix is available in the `testlink_1_9_20_fixed` branch of the TestLink repository.
