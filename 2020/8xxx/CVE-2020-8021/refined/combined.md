| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-05-14 08:17:24 UTC  ``` through an email   Hi,  currently, it is possible for an unprivileged user to access (read-only) the files of an OBS package where the sourceaccess/access is disabled in the meta. The exploit is documented in the attached mergeservice_exploit.txt file. I also attached a potential patch (see the 0001-backend-bs_srcserver-Forbid-the-creation-of-a-_link-.patch file).  md5sum                            attached file 7d6787b7d854381da5d672fb29163c14  mergeservice_exploit.txt 9b7d3878d70acef3bf7f2cbfb0565bbc  0001-backend-bs_srcserver-Forbid-the-creation-of-a-_link-.patch ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2020-05-14 08:19:46 UTC  ``` The reporter was actually  Marcus Hüwe <suse-tux@gmx.de> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-05-14 09:49:47 UTC  ``` I don't think this is actually news. In the OBS server side review I found different ways to get around this restriction. See [bug 1085033 comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1085033#c27 "IN_PROGRESS") section "sourceaccess disabled". ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c5)  Marcus Hüwe   2020-05-14 22:15:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Matthias Gerstner from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c4)) > I don't think this is actually news. In the OBS server side review I found > different ways to get around this restriction. See [bug 1085033 comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1085033#c27 "IN_PROGRESS") > section "sourceaccess disabled".  Ah ok - I'm not authorized to access that bug... Without knowing the details, a most likely "naive" question: if the issue is known, why don't we fix it? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c6)  Adrian Schröter   2020-05-15 05:49:06 UTC  ``` we will fix it and I see actually not a reference to mergeservice in the mentioned bug rereport. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2020-05-15 15:48:53 UTC  ``` JUst to be clear, this issue had no CVE yet? And is confirmed to be a valid security isssue?  Then we would assign a CVE. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c8)  Adrian Schröter   2020-05-15 18:03:12 UTC  ``` Yes, it is valid and has no CVE yet. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c9)  Marcus Meissner   2020-05-15 18:33:53 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2020-8021. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2020-05-19 12:51:40 UTC  ``` Making public to allow for publishing of CVE ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c12)  Utkarsh Gupta   2020-10-01 11:19:59 UTC  ``` Hello,  Any ETA on this? Is there a fix out? If so, could you point me to the fixing commit? :)  Thanks! ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c13)  Marcus Hüwe   2020-10-01 12:12:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Utkarsh Gupta from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1171649#c12)) > Any ETA on this? Is there a fix out? > If so, could you point me to the fixing commit? :) >  It is fixed in commit 7323c904f86ba9e04065c23422d06c03647589fb ("bs_srcserver: Forbid the creation of a _link in mergeservicerun") (see [1]).
