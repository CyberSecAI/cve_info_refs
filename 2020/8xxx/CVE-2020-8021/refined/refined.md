Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-8021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Open Build Service (OBS) where it's possible to bypass access restrictions related to source code. Specifically, a crafted `_service` file can be used to gain unauthorized read access to files within an OBS package, even when `sourceaccess` or `access` is disabled. This bypass occurs due to the ability to create a `_link` within the `mergeservicerun` context, which then circumvents the intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to enforce access control restrictions when handling specially crafted `_service` files.
- **Bypass of Source Access Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass the `sourceaccess` and `access` restrictions set for OBS packages.
- **Unrestricted File Read:** Exploitation grants read-only access to files within the package, which should not be accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can read source code and other files within a package, potentially exposing sensitive data, proprietary information, or intellectual property.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted `_service` File:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by creating a malicious `_service` file containing a crafted `_link`.
- **`mergeservicerun` context:** The attack leverages the `mergeservicerun` context where the `_link` is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unprivileged User:** An unprivileged user on the OBS system is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Submit/Modify `_service` Files:** The attacker needs to be able to submit or modify `_service` files within the OBS system.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report mentions a potential patch that forbids the creation of `_link` in `mergeservicerun` which was later resolved by commit `7323c904f86ba9e04065c23422d06c03647589fb`.
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms the vulnerability and indicates it affects open-build-service versions up to 2.7.1-10+deb9u1.

In summary, CVE-2020-8021 is an improper access control vulnerability in Open Build Service that allows unprivileged users to read files from packages where source access is disabled, by exploiting a flaw in how `_service` files are processed.
