## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1817#issue-550426873)

The `ossec-analysisd`'s `OS_ReadMSG` function calls `OS_CleanMSG` at the start of processing a received message from the ossec queue UNIX domain socket.

In `src/analysisd/cleanevent.c` the `OS_CleanMSG` function populates the `lf` struct, setting fields like `log`, `hostname` and `program_name` to substrings of the `lf->full_log` buffer.

After cleaning any messages that meet the ossec-alert decoder's criteria are given to that decoder for further processing.

After processing an ossec alert msg from a client the ossec alert decoder will free the `lf->full_log` pointer at the end of its processing, replacing it with a new pointer and populating `lf->generated_rule`:

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/decoders/plugins/ossecalert\_decoder.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/decoders/plugins/ossecalert_decoder.c#L184-L191)

Lines 184 to 191
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | free(lf->full\_log); |
| --- | --- |
|  | lf->full\_log = NULL; |
|  | os\_strdup(tmpstr\_buffer, lf->full\_log); |
|  | lf->log = lf->full\_log; |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Rule that generated. \*/ |
|  | lf->generated\_rule = rule\_pointer; |

Though the `OSSECAlert_Decoder_Exec` function returns `NULL` and not `1` further rule processing of the `lf` struct occurs during `OS_ReadMSG` because of the `lf->generated_rule` set by the decoder before freeing `lf->full_log`.

[ossec-hids/src/analysisd/analysisd.c](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/blob/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c/src/analysisd/analysisd.c#L872-L879)

Lines 872 to 879
in
[abb36d4](/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/abb36d4460b9f44ee90790d1138192bb01a2b21c)

|  | if (lf->decoder\_info->type == OSSEC\_ALERT) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | if (!lf->generated\_rule) { |
|  | goto CLMEM; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Process the alert \*/ |
|  | currently\_rule = lf->generated\_rule; |
|  | } |

If any subsequent processing associated with the generated rule accesses the `lf->hostname` or `lf->program_name` fields set by `OS_CleanMSG` they will be accessing memory of a freed heap chunk previously containing the `lf->full_log`.

I believe the bug was introduced in [fcca013](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/commit/fcca01326255d66fa2b3f75357cda3780169c86d) on July 23, 2008 and affects OSSEC v2.7+.

This is triggerable via an authenticated client through the `ossec-remoted`. The client needs only write a ossecalert message that will have the `program_name` or `hostname` set during `OS_CleanMSG`.

I don't have a strong sense for the possibility of exploitation. I suspect this may be turned into an out of bounds read of heap memory accessing `program_name` or `hostname` during rule processing if the area pointed to after the syscheck decoder free isn't null terminated.

One possible fix would be for the ossecalert decoder to `os_strdup` the `lf->hostname` and `lf->program_name` before freeing `full_log`.

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jan 15, 2020](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1821#issue-550427631)

Hi folks,

I spent some free time recently auditing OSSEC. I was primarily focused on a threat model where an OSSEC agent is compromised (e.g. the agent key and assoc. counters are known) and used to attack the OSSEC server (primarily `ossec-remoted` and `ossec-analysisd`). Given the problem domain of OSSEC and HIDS generally I think this is fair game. Since these are post-auth bugs and there isn't guidance on vulnerability disclosure in the README I thought it was acceptable to post information full-disclosure to the repo.

I found a handful of bugs and have done my best to address the root cause, the affected versions, the impact and potential fixes in the issues I've filed. I will request CVEs for the security relevant bugs later on.

In terms of rough risk levels I'd categorize the findings as follows:

Informational:

* rootcheck-check-rc-if-shell-injection-risk - [rootcheck: risk of shell metachar injection in check-rc-if. #1812](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1812)

Low:

* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-allows-control-chars-in-msg ([CVE-2020-8445](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9vhf-xgg9-m6cf "CVE-2020-8445")) - [CVE-2020-8445: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG allows control characters in msg. #1814](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1814)
* analysisd-OS\_CleanMSG-bad-location-segfault ([CVE-2020-8448](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8vg3-7pxv-7pq6 "CVE-2020-8448")) - [CVE-2020-8448: analysisd: OS\_CleanMSG segfault processing invalid msg location. #1815](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1815) (*Edit: now fixed by [analysisd: fix possible null ptr deref in OS\_CleanMSG. #1823](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/pull/1823)*)

Some caveats/context to add:

1. I'm not a professional C coder, w.r.t suggested fixes YMMV!
2. I don't write exploits for a living. My assessments of exploitability/risk should be considered lower bounds.
3. This wasn't an extensive audit. I followed my nose and used some fuzzing.
4. OSSEC 2.7 seems to be the earliest tag in the Github repo. I didn't dig deeper into history to see if any of these bugs affect older releases (some likely do).

If you would be interested in trying to adopt fuzzing as part of your CI (or as an integration with oss-fuzz, etc) I'd be happy to try and provide some notes but likely don't have the resources to implement it myself to a merge-able standard of work.

Thanks! You can close this top-level issue as you see appropriate.

When removing the `"[ID xx facility.severity] "` substring of a syslog message in `OS_CleanMSG` care needs to be taken to stay within the bounds of the msg buffer when advancing past the `"] "` in the msg.

Prev. to this commit the `pieces` pointer is incremented by 2 when there may be only 1 character remaining before the null terminator.

Resolves [#1816](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids/issues/1816)

Sorry, something went wrong.
