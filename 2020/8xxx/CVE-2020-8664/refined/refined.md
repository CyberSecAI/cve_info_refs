  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-8664",
    "description": "envoy: Incorrect Access Control when using SDS with Combined Validation Context",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 1.0 for RHEL 8 x86_64"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The SDS TLS validation context update callback was only called when the secret was received for the first time or when its value changed. If the same secret was used in multiple resources, then resources configured after the secret was already received remained unconfigured until the secret's value changed. Due to an incorrect code, the available secret was processed like inlined validation context, and only rules from the dynamic part of the validation context were applied, leading to a bypass of rules from the static part.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect Access Control"
      ],
      "impact": "Security restrictions bypass, Unauthorized access to service, service spoofing, Escalation of Privileges",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could bypass security restrictions by exploiting the incorrect access control in Envoy when using SDS with Combined Validation Context using the same TLS secret across multiple resources.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to send requests that utilize the misconfigured TLS setup."
    },
    "remediation": "The vulnerability is fixed in servicemesh-proxy version 1.0.9-2.el8."
