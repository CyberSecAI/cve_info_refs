Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-2173:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gatling Plugin served Gatling reports in a way that bypassed the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) protection implemented in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
Users able to modify the content of Gatling reports can inject malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to change the report content. This could be achieved through access to the build environment or through other vulnerabilities that allow report manipulation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability existed in Gatling Plugin versions 1.2.7 and earlier.
- The fix in Gatling Plugin version 1.3.0 prevents direct viewing of Gatling reports in Jenkins. Instead, users download an archive containing the report.
- This was identified as SECURITY-1633.
