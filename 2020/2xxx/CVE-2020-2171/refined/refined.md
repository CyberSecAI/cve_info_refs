Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2171:

**CVE-2020-2171**

*   **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The RapidDeploy Plugin for Jenkins does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*  **Weaknesses:** The plugin's XML parser processes XML files without disabling external entity resolution, allowing for inclusion of external entities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the Jenkins master by leveraging external entities to access local files.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can force the Jenkins server to make requests to other servers, internal or external.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Attackers could potentially cause a DoS by including entities that expand exponentially.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user with the ability to control input files for the "RapidDeploy deployment package build" build or post-build step can inject malicious XML containing external entities.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have permissions to configure jobs or provide input files to the specified build steps of RapidDeploy Plugin.
    *   The attacker must be able to provide an input file (XML) to the RapidDeploy plugin's build or post-build step.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in RapidDeploy Plugin versions 4.2 and earlier.
*   The fix involves disabling external entity resolution in the XML parser in RapidDeploy Plugin version 4.2.1.
