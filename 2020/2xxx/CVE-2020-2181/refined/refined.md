Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2181:

**CVE-2020-2181**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Credentials Binding Plugin failed to mask secrets in build logs when a build did not contain any build steps.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin did not properly sanitize or mask sensitive information (secrets) when no explicit build steps were present in the Jenkins job.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exposed secrets within build logs which could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could view the build logs of a Jenkins job configured to use credentials binding. If the job did not include any explicit build steps, the secrets would be exposed in the logs.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to view build logs. Typically requires at least Job/Read permission.

**Additional Information:**
* This vulnerability is specific to Credentials Binding Plugin versions 1.22 and earlier.
* Credentials Binding Plugin version 1.23 addressed this issue by masking secrets even when no build steps are present.
