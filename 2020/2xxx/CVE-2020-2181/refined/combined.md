# SCM Filter Jervis YAML Plugin

This plugin is intended for Jenkins infrastructure relying on [jervis](https://github.com/samrocketman/jervis/wiki) to deliver software in a self-service manner.

This plugin can also be used for Travis CI YAML.

# How to configure this plugin

1. Configure a multibranch pipeline job or a GitHub organization job.
2. Select GitHub Branch Source as the SCM type for the repository.
3. Under behaviors, click the `Add` button and select `Filter by Jervis YAML for branches, pull requests, and tags.`

   [![Screenshot of add Jervis behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875669/68359670-beb37280-00ea-11ea-8b71-1f19e4d926e9.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875669/68359670-beb37280-00ea-11ea-8b71-1f19e4d926e9.png)
4. Save or customize the YAML file name. You can customize the YAML file name to be something other than `.jervis.yml` at the root of the repository.

   [![Screenshot of configuring Jervis behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875669/68359738-09cd8580-00eb-11ea-9782-c68d218c8b79.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/875669/68359738-09cd8580-00eb-11ea-9782-c68d218c8b79.png)

# Short Introduction

This will look at the root of a GitHub reference for `.jervis.yml` for the branches and tags filtering. You can customize the name of the YAML file searched for if you like.

For Tags:

* It will filter for the tag name.

For Branches:

* It will filter for the branch name.
* It will filter for pull requests destined for the branch name.

### Example YAML

```
branches:
  only:
    - main
```

# More on specify branches and tags to build

By default Jervis will generate Jenkins jobs for all branches that have a `.jervis.yml` file. You can control and limit this behavior by specifying the `branches` or `tags` key in your `.jervis.yml`.

### Allow or block branches and tags

You can either create an allow list of branches (only) or a block list of branches (except) to be built.

```
# block branches from building
branches:
  except:
    - legacy
    - experimental

# allow only these branches
branches:
  only:
    - main
    - stable
```

The same YAML can be applied to tags.

```
# block tags from building
tags:
  except:
    - /.*-rc/
    - /.*-beta/

# allow only these tags
tags:
  only:
    - /v[.0-9]+/
```

If you specify both `only` and `except`, then `except` will be ignored. `.jervis.yml` needs to be present on all branches you want to be built. `.jervis.yml` will be interpreted in the context of that branch so if you specify an allow list in your main branch, then it will not propagate to other branches.

### Using regular expressions

You can use regular expressions to allow or block branches:

```
branches:
  only:
    - main
    - /^[.0-9]+-hotfix$/
```

Any name surrounded with `/` in the list of branches is treated as a regular expression. The expression will use [`Pattern.compile`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile%28java.lang.String%29) to compile the regex string into a [Groovy regular expression](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/index.html#_regular_expression_operators).

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

## Descriptions

### Secrets are not masked by Credentials Binding Plugin in builds without build steps

**SECURITY-1374
/
CVE-2020-2181**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets when the build contains no build steps.
Â

### Improper masking of some secrets in Credentials Binding Plugin

**SECURITY-1835
/
CVE-2020-2182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`.
This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`).
This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.

### Improper permission checks in Copy Artifact Plugin

**SECURITY-988
/
CVE-2020-2183**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copyartifact`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact)**

**Description:**

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build.
This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts.
When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained ("Migration mode").
To enable the additional protections, switch to the new "Production mode".
Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts.
For more information see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).

### CSRF vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-1094
/
CVE-2020-2184**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

CVS Plugin 2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing SSH host key validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-381
/
CVE-2020-2185**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 provides strategies for performing host key validation for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
It includes assistance for administrators to migrate to a new, more secure strategy.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-unix-amis).

### CSRF vulnerability in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1408
/
CVE-2020-2186**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows an attacker to provision instances with an attacker-specified template ID.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1528
/
CVE-2020-2187**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation.
A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis).

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1844
/
CVE-2020-2188**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### RCE vulnerability in SCM Filter Jervis Plugin

**SECURITY-1826
/
CVE-2020-2189**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`scm-filter-jervis`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scm-filter-jervis)**

**Description:**

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

## Severity

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an
attacker-specified template ID.

SECURITY-1528 / CVE-2020-2187
Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed
HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting
to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1844 / CVE-2020-2188
Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2
Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission
to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1826 / CVE-2020-2189
SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.
