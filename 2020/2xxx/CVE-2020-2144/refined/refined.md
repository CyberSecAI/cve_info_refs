Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Rundeck Plugin, in versions 3.6.6 and earlier, does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper configuration of the XML parser, which allows for the resolution of external entities. This leads to an XXE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
* Extract secrets from the Jenkins master by reading arbitrary files
* Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF)

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with XML data containing malicious external entities. The Jenkins server, using the vulnerable plugin, will then parse the XML, triggering the XXE vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
* The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Jenkins server that includes XML data.

**Additional Details:**
* This vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-1702 in the Jenkins security advisory.
* The fix is available in Rundeck Plugin version 3.6.7, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
