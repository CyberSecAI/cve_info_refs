- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SQLPlus Script Runner Plugin prints the `sqlplus` command invocation to the build log, including the password as a command line argument, without redacting it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information disclosure, specifically a password being written to the build log.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users with Item/Read permission can view the password in the build log, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Item/Read permission can access the build logs and view the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Item/Read permissions for the Jenkins project where the SQLPlus Script Runner Plugin is used.
