Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-2150:

**CVE-2020-2150**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sonar Quality Gates Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file (`org.quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml`) on the Jenkins master. While these credentials are encrypted at rest, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Credentials transmitted in plain text.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially intercept the plain text credentials when they are transmitted as part of the configuration form via network sniffing or other means.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to observe the network traffic or have control over a system capable of intercepting the plain text credentials during the configuration form transmission. This could also be achieved through XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Sonar Quality Gates Plugin version 1.3.1 and earlier.
*   As of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
