Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2135:

**CVE-2020-2135:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Script Security Plugin that fails to properly restrict method calls on objects implementing the `GroovyInterceptable` interface.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize or validate method calls on `GroovyInterceptable` objects.
    *   **Sandbox Bypass:** The incomplete fix for SECURITY-582 led to the ability to bypass the sandbox using crafted constructor calls and method calls on `GroovyInterceptable` objects.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers capable of running sandboxed scripts can execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins master JVM.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted Method Calls:** Attackers can craft method calls on `GroovyInterceptable` objects to execute malicious code.
    *   **Sandboxed Scripts:** Attackers must be able to specify and run sandboxed scripts.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attackers need the ability to specify and execute sandboxed scripts in Jenkins. This could be through configuration of build jobs or other means where a script is evaluated.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is associated with `SECURITY-1754` and is one part of a larger fix which also includes `CVE-2020-2134`.
*   The vulnerability is present in Script Security Plugin version 1.70 and earlier.
*   The fix in Script Security Plugin 1.71 includes:
    *   Additional restrictions and checks to prevent bypassing the sandbox through constructor calls.
    *   Interception of method calls on objects implementing `GroovyInterceptable`, treating them as calls to `GroovyObject#invokeMethod(String, Object)` which is a dangerous signature and blocked by the sandbox.
