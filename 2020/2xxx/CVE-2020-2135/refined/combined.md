SECURITY-1754 / CVE-2020-2134 (constructors) & CVE-2020-2135 (GroovyInterceptable)
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be
circumvented through:

* Crafted constructor calls and bodies
* Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1723 / CVE-2020-2136
Git Plugin 4.2.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the
repository URL for Microsoft TFS field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1784 / CVE-2020-2137
Timestamper Plugin 1.11.1 and earlier does not escape or sanitize the HTML
formatting used to display the timestamps in console output for builds.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1700 / CVE-2020-2138
Cobertura Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish
Cobertura Coverage Report' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted
file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins
master or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1668 / CVE-2020-2139
Cobertura Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not validate file paths from the XML
file it parses.

This allows attackers able to control the coverage report content to
overwrite any file on the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1722 / CVE-2020-2140
Audit Trail Plugin 3.2 and earlier does not escape the error message for
the URL Patterns field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can
also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by
users with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1765 / CVE-2020-2141 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2142 (missing permission check)
P4 Plugin 1.10.10 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several
HTTP endpoints. This allows users with Overall/Read access to trigger
builds or add labels in the Perforce repository.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1516 / CVE-2020-2143
Logstash Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file
`jenkins.plugins.logstash.LogstashConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins master
as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Logstash Plugin 2.3.1 and
earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1702 / CVE-2020-2144
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.6 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins parse a crafted
HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1596 / CVE-2020-2145
Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin 1.9.1 and earlier stores its
Zephyr password in plain text in the global configuration file
`com.thed.zephyr.jenkins.reporter.ZeeReporter.xml`. This password can be
viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1692 / CVE-2020-2146
Mac Plugin 1.1.0 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when
connecting to Mac Cloud host launched by the plugin. This lack of
validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept
these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1761 / CVE-2020-2147 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2148 (missing permission check)
Mac Plugin 1.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH host using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1520 / CVE-2020-2149
Repository Connector Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration
file
`org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.repositoryconnector.RepositoryConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Repository Connector Plugin
1.2.6 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1523 / CVE-2020-2150

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1754
/
CVE-2020-2134 (constructors), CVE-2020-2135 (GroovyInterceptable)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be circumvented through:

* Crafted constructor calls and bodies (due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-582](/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#super-constructor-calls))
* Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Script Security Plugin 1.71 has additional restrictions and sanity checks to ensure that super constructors cannot be constructed without being intercepted by the sandbox.
In addition, it also intercepts method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable` as calls to `GroovyObject#invokeMethod(String, Object)`, which is on the list of dangerous signatures and should not be approved for use in the sandbox.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-1723
/
CVE-2020-2136**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

**Affected plugin:
[`cobertura`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cobertura)**

**Description:**

Cobertura Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not validate file paths from the XML file it parses.

This allows attackers able to control the coverage report content to overwrite any file on the Jenkins controller file system.

Cobertura Plugin 1.16 sanitizes the file paths to prevent escape from the base directory.

### XSS vulnerability in Audit Trail Plugin

**SECURITY-1722
/
CVE-2020-2140**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`audit-trail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail)**

**Affected plugin:
[`p4`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4)**

**Description:**

P4 Plugin 1.10.10 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to trigger builds or add labels in the Perforce repository.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

P4 Plugin 1.10.11 requires POST requests and appropriate user permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Credentials transmitted in plain text by Logstash Plugin

**SECURITY-1516
/
CVE-2020-2143**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`logstash`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/logstash)**

**Description:**

Logstash Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file `jenkins.plugins.logstash.LogstashConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Logstash Plugin 2.3.1 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Logstash Plugin 2.3.2 transmits the credentials in its global configuration encrypted.

### XXE vulnerability in Rundeck Plugin

**SECURITY-1702
/
CVE-2020-2144**
