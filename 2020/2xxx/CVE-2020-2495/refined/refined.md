- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the File Station, System Connection Logs and certificate configuration of QNAP's QTS and QuTS hero operating systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This means that the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it within a web page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If successfully exploited, a remote attacker could inject and execute arbitrary malicious code within the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a remote network and requires a user to interact with the malicious content. The vulnerability is specifically in File Station, System Connection Logs and certificate configuration of QTS and QuTS hero.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable components. This typically involves finding a way to insert attacker-controlled data which is not properly sanitized by the application.
