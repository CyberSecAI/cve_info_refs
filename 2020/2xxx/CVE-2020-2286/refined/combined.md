SECURITY-1767 / CVE-2020-2286
Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.12 and newer uses a cache to
speed up permission lookups.

In Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.0 and earlier this cache is
not invalidated properly when an administrator changes the permission
configuration. This can result in permissions being granted long after the
configuration was changed to no longer grant them.

SECURITY-1815 / CVE-2020-2287
Audit Trail Plugin logs requests whose URL path matches an admin-configured
regular expression.

A discrepancy between the behavior of the plugin and the Stapler web
framework in parsing URL paths allows attackers to craft URLs that would
bypass request logging in Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier.

SECURITY-1846 / CVE-2020-2288
Audit Trail Plugin uses regular expressions to match requested URLs whose
dispatch should be logged.

In Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier, the default regular expression
pattern could be bypassed in many cases by adding a suffix to the URL that
would be ignored during request handling.

SECURITY-1954 / CVE-2020-2289
Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape the name and
description of build parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2008 / CVE-2020-2290
Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape `List` and `Map`
return values of sandboxed scripts for _Reactive Reference Parameter_.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2065 / CVE-2020-2291
couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores its server password
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.couchstats.CouchStatsConfig.xml` on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.

SECURITY-1928 / CVE-2020-2292
Release Plugin 2.10.2 and earlier does not escape the release version in
the badge tooltip.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Release/Release permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2046 / CVE-2020-2293
Persona Plugin 2.4 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read permission to
read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2049 / CVE-2020-2294 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2295 (CSRF)
Maven Cascade Release Plugin 1.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start cascade builds
and layout builds, and reconfigure the plugin.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2052 / CVE-2020-2296
Shared Objects Plugin 0.44 and earlier does not require POST requests for
an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to configure shared objects.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2054 / CVE-2020-2297
SMS Notification Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores an access token unencrypted
in its global configuration file
`com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller as
part of its configuration.

This access token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins
controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2097 / CVE-2020-2298
Nerrvana Plugin 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a
crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

Additionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that
does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without
Overall/Read permission via CSRF.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

## About this plugin

The Role Strategy plugin is meant to be used from [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) to add a new role-based mechanism to manage users' permissions. Supported features

* Creating **global roles**, such as admin, job creator, anonymous, etc., allowing to set Overall, Agent, Job, Run, View and SCM permissions on a global basis.
* Creating **item roles**, allowing to set item specific permissions (e.g Job, Run or Credentials) on Jobs, Pipelines and Folders.
* Creating **agent roles**, allowing to set agent specific permissions.
* Assigning these roles to users and user groups
* Extending roles and permissions matching via [Macro extensions](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/master/./docs/MACROS.md)

## Usage

### Installing and enabling the plugin

The Role Strategy plugin can be installed from any Jenkins installation connected to the Internet using the **Plugin Manager** screen. Activate the Role-Based Strategy by using the standard *Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security* screen:

[![Configure Security](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin@master/docs/images/configureSecurity.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/configureSecurity.png)

After the installation, the plugin can be configured using the *Manage and Assign Roles* screen accessible from *Manage Jenkins* .

### Configuring roles

You can define roles by using the *Manages Roles* screen. It is possible to define global, item and agent specific roles.

* Global roles apply to any item in Jenkins and override *anything* you specify in the Item Roles. That is, when you give a role the right `Job/Read` in the Global Roles, then this role is allowed to read all Jobs, no matter what you specify in the Item Roles. Giving `Job/Create` in a global role will allow to create jobs of any name.
* For item and agent roles you can set a regular expression pattern for matching items. The regular expression aimes at matching the full item name.
  + For example, if you set the field to `Roger-.*`, then the role will match all jobs which name starts with `Roger-`.
  + Patterns are case-sensitive. To perform a case-insensitive match, use `(?i)` notation: upper, `Roger-.*` vs. lower, `roger-.*` vs. case-insensitive, `(?i)roger-.*`.
  + Folders can be matched using expressions like `^foo/bar.*`. To access jobs inside a folder, the folder itself must also be accessible to the user. This can be achieved with a single pattern like `(?i)folder($|/.*)` when the permissions on the folder can be the same as for the jobs. If different permissions need to be configured 2 different roles need to be created, e.g. `(?i)folder` and `(?i)folder/.*`. Note that job names inside folders are case-sensitive, though this is probably a bug in the folders plugin [JENKINS-67695](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67695). Case sensitivity can be enabled with `(?-i)`, e.g. `(?i)folder/(?-i).*`
  + Create permissions on item level can only reliably work when the `Naming Strategy` is set to `Role-Based strategy` in the global configuration for `Restrict project naming`. You should see a warning in the administrative monitors if it is not enabled. Only jobs matching the pattern can be created. When granting `Job/Create` you should also grant `Job/Configure` and `Job/Read` otherwise you will be able to create new jobs but you will not be able to configure them. Global Permissions are not required.

[![Managing roles](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin@master/docs/images/manageRoles.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/manageRoles.png)

#### Permission Templates

Permission Templates simplify the administration of roles when you need to maintain many roles with identical permissions but different patterns. Templates are only available for *Item Roles*. The permissions of roles based on a template can't be modified directly. Modifying the template will immediately modify the linked roles after saving the changes.

Deleting a template that is still in use requires confirmation. In case you still delete it, the roles stay with the given permissions but the correlation to the template is removed.

### Assigning roles

You can assign roles to users and user groups using the *Assign Roles* screen

* User groups represent authorities provided by the Security Realm (e.g. Active Directory or LDAP plugin can provide groups)
* There are also two built-in groups: `authenticated` (users who logged in) and `anonymous` (any user, including ones who have not logged in)
* Hovering over the header row will show a tooltip with the permissions associated to the role and the pattern.
* Hovering over a checkbox will show a tooltip with role, user/group and pattern.

[![Assign roles](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin@master/docs/images/assignRoles.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/role-strategy-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/assignRoles.png)

### Getting roles in pipelines

There are 2 steps available in pipeline jobs that allow to get the roles of the user running the build. When the build was triggered by a user via the UI or the REST API, the roles of this user are returned. In case the build was triggered by the times or an SCM event there is no dedicated user available and the `SYSTEM` user is used. This user is considered like an admin and will have all roles.
 With the [Authorize Project](https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project/) plugin, it is possible to make builds triggered by timer or an SCM event to run as a specific user which is then used or run as `anonymous`. For `anonymous` it means no roles are returned. The user that triggered the build will always take precedence over the user that is configured via `Authorize Project`.

#### currentUserGlobalRoles

The step `currentUserGlobalRoles` will return all global roles of the user.

#### currentUserItemRoles

The step `currentUserItemRoles` will return the item roles of the user. By default, it returns only those roles that match the currently building pipeline. The parameter `showAllRoles` will return all item roles of the user.

### Rest API

The Rest API allows to query the current roles and assignments and to do changes to them. Please see the [javadoc](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/plugin/role-strategy/com/michelin/cio/hudson/plugins/rolestrategy/RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy.html) for details and examples.

### Config & Assign role by using Jenkins Script Console or Groovy Hook Script

Configuration management can be used via [Jenkins Script Console](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/) or [Groovy Hook Scripts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/groovy-hook-scripts/), following example is creating an admin role & user based on plugin 3.1.

```
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.AuthorizationType
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.PermissionEntry
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy
import com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.Role
import com.synopsys.arc.jenkins.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleType
import hudson.security.Permission
import jenkins.model.Jenkins

Jenkins jenkins = Jenkins.get()
def rbas = new RoleBasedAuthorizationStrategy()

/* create admin role */
Set<Permission> permissions = new HashSet<>();
permissions.add(Jenkins.ADMINISTER)
Role adminRole = new Role("admin", permissions)

globalRoleMap = rbas.getRoleMap(RoleType.Global)
globalRoleMap.addRole(adminRole)
/* assign admin role to user 'admin' */
globalRoleMap.assignRole(adminRole, new PermissionEntry(AuthorizationType.USER, 'admin'))
/* assign admin role to group 'administrators' */
globalRoleMap.assignRole(adminRole, new PermissionEntry(AuthorizationType.GROUP, 'administrators'))
jenkins.setAuthorizationStrategy(rbas)

jenkins.save()
```

### Case sensitive mode

In previous versions of this plugin, role assignments where always matched case-sensitive, even when the security realm works case-insensitive (as do most of them). As of version 685 the plugin will use the strategy given by the security realm to match assigned roles. If for some reason you need the old behaviour, set the property `com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.FORCE_CASE_SENSITIVE` via command line `jenkins -Dcom.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.FORCE_CASE_SENSITIVE=true -war jenkins.war`, set it via the script console or via an init hook script.

## Descriptions

### Improper authorization due to caching in Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin

**SECURITY-1767
/
CVE-2020-2286**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`role-strategy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy)**

**Description:**

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.12 and newer uses a cache to speed up permission lookups.

In Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.0 and earlier this cache is not invalidated properly when an administrator changes the permission configuration.
This can result in permissions being granted long after the configuration was changed to no longer grant them.

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.1 properly invalidates the cache on configuration changes.

### Request logging could be bypassed in Audit Trail Plugin

**SECURITY-1815
/
CVE-2020-2287**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`audit-trail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail)**

**Description:**

Audit Trail Plugin logs requests whose URL path matches an admin-configured regular expression.

A discrepancy between the behavior of the plugin and the Stapler web framework in parsing URL paths allows attackers to craft URLs that would bypass request logging in Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier.
This only applies to Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, as the fix for [SECURITY-1774](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1774) prohibits dispatch of affected requests.

Audit Trail Plugin 3.7 processes request URL paths the same way as the Stapler web framework.

### Incorrect default pattern in Audit Trail Plugin

**SECURITY-1846
/
CVE-2020-2288**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`audit-trail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail)**

**Description:**

Audit Trail Plugin uses regular expressions to match requested URLs whose dispatch should be logged.

In Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier, the default regular expression pattern could be bypassed in many cases by adding a suffix to the URL that would be ignored during request handling.

Audit Trail Plugin 3.7 changes the default regular expression pattern so that it allows for arbitrary suffixes.
It automatically will replace previous default patterns with the new, more complete default pattern.

Additionally, an administrative monitor is shown if a user-specified pattern is found to be bypassable through crafted URLs and form validation was improved to recognize patterns that would not match requests with arbitrary suffixes.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Active Choices Plugin

**SECURITY-1954
/
CVE-2020-2289**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`uno-choice`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice)**

**Description:**

Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape the name and description of build parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

Active Choices Plugin 2.5 escapes the name of build parameters and applies the configured markup formatter to the description of build parameters.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Active Choices Plugin

**SECURITY-2008
/
CVE-2020-2290**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`uno-choice`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice)**

**Description:**

Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape `List` and `Map` return values of sandboxed scripts for *Reactive Reference Parameter*.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

This issue is caused by an incomplete fix for [SECURITY-470](/security/advisory/2017-10-23/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-active-choices-plugin).

Active Choices Plugin 2.5 escapes all legal return values of sandboxed scripts.

### Password stored in plain text by couchdb-statistics Plugin

**SECURITY-2065
/
CVE-2020-2291**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`couchdb-statistics`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/couchdb-statistics)**

**Description:**

couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores its server password unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.couchstats.CouchStatsConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.4 stores its server password encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Release Plugin

**SECURITY-1928
/
CVE-2020-2292**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/release)**

**Description:**

Release Plugin 2.10.2 and earlier does not escape the release version in the badge tooltip.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Release/Release permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Persona Plugin

**SECURITY-2046
/
CVE-2020-2293**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`persona`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/persona)**

**Description:**

Persona Plugin 2.4 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Maven Cascade Release Plugin

**SECURITY-2049
/
CVE-2020-2294 (permission check), CVE-2020-2295 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`maven-release-cascade`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-release-cascade)**

**Description:**

Maven Cascade Release Plugin 1.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start cascade builds and layout builds, and reconfigure the plugin.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability in Shared Objects Plugin

**SECURITY-2052
/
CVE-2020-2296**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`shared-objects`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shared-objects)**

**Description:**

Shared Objects Plugin 0.44 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to configure shared objects.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Access token stored in plain text by SMS Notification Plugin

**SECURITY-2054
/
CVE-2020-2297**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sms`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sms)**

**Description:**

SMS Notification Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores an access token unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This access token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XXE vulnerability in Nerrvana Plugin

**SECURITY-2097
/
CVE-2020-2298**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`nerrvana-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nerrvana-plugin)**

**Description:**

Nerrvana Plugin 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without Overall/Read permission via CSRF.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
