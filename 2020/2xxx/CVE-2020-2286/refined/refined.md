**Summary:** The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin for Jenkins, identified as CVE-2020-2286 (SECURITY-1767). The vulnerability is due to improper cache invalidation, which can result in users retaining permissions even after the administrator has revoked them.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin uses a cache to speed up permission lookups, but this cache is not properly invalidated when an administrator changes the permission configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper cache invalidation: The primary weakness is the failure to clear the permission cache when changes are made to the permission settings.
- Authorization bypass: This allows users to retain permissions they should no longer have, effectively bypassing the intended authorization scheme.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: Users can continue to perform actions they are no longer authorized to do, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or performing unauthorized modifications.
- Privilege escalation: In some cases, users might be able to perform actions normally reserved for administrators or users with higher privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Jenkins web interface, where an administrator modifies the permission configuration of the Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin. 
- After the configuration change, the cached permissions are not invalidated immediately which could be exploited

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a Jenkins user who was previously granted permissions, and an administrator must change permission configuration
- The attacker would benefit from the delay in cache invalidation before reauthentication

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin versions 2.12 up to and including 3.0.
- The fix is included in version 3.1 of the plugin, where the cache is properly invalidated on configuration changes.
