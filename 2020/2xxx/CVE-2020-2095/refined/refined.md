- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information (NuGet API key) is stored in plain text instead of being encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially view the stored API key by gaining access to job configurations through the Jenkins interface (Extended Read permission) or by accessing the Jenkins controller's file system.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Accessing the job's `config.xml` file via the Jenkins UI with the "Extended Read" permission.
    - Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system where configuration files are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have at least "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins, or access to the Jenkins controller filesystem.
