Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AWSEB Deployment Plugin does not properly escape values that are included in the form validation output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to sanitize output, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the form validation output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the Jenkins UI
    - Access to sensitive information
    - Phishing attacks
   
**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the form validation output of the AWSEB Deployment Plugin.
- An attacker crafts a request that includes malicious JavaScript within the data sent to the plugin.
- When the form validation is performed, the plugin renders this unsanitized data, leading to script execution in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send a request with crafted input to the Jenkins server.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated with Jenkins as it's a reflected XSS vulnerability. A victim needs to trigger the malicious request.
