CVE-2020-2161: Stored XSS vulnerability in label expression validation
Root cause: The form validation for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape label names.
Vulnerability: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
Impact: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser.
Attack vector: Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes. These labels can be referenced in job configurations. By crafting a malicious label, an attacker can inject XSS payload.
Required capabilities: Ability to define node labels (Agent/Configure permissions).
Affected versions: Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier.
Fix: Jenkins now correctly escapes node labels that are shown in form validation on job configuration pages.
