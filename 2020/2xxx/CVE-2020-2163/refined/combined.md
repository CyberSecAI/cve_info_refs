## Descriptions

### CSRF protection for any URL could be bypassed

**SECURITY-1774
/
CVE-2020-2160**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.

Implementations of that extension point received a different representation of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier.
This discrepancy allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

Jenkins now uses the same representation of the URL path to decide whether CSRF protection is needed for a given URL as the Stapler web framework uses.

|  | In case of problems, administrators can disable this security fix by setting the system property `hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.UNPROCESSED_PATHINFO` to `true`. |
| --- | --- |

|  | As an additional safeguard, semicolon (`;`) characters in the path part of a URL are now banned by default. Administrators can disable this protection by setting the system property `jenkins.security.SuspiciousRequestFilter.allowSemicolonsInPath` to `true`. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in label expression validation

**SECURITY-1781
/
CVE-2020-2161**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes.
These labels can be referenced in job configurations to restrict where a job can be run.

In Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, the form validation for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape label names, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to define node labels.

Jenkins now correctly escapes node labels that are shown in form validation on job configuration pages.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in file parameters

**SECURITY-1793
/
CVE-2020-2162**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier served files uploaded as file parameters to a build without specifying appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers.
This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with permissions to build a job with file parameters.

Jenkins now sets `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers when serving files uploaded via a file parameter to the same value as used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts not served using the Resource Root URL.

The system property `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP` can be set to override the value of `Content-Security-Policy` headers sent when serving these files.
This is the same system property used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts unless those are served via the [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) and works the same way for file parameters.
See [Configuring Content Security Policy](/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy) to learn more.

|  | Even when Jenkins is configured to serve files in workspaces and archived artifacts using the Resource Root URL (introduced in Jenkins 2.200), file parameters are not, and therefore still subject to `Content-Security-Policy` restrictions. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in list view column headers

**SECURITY-1796
/
CVE-2020-2163**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier processed HTML embedded in list view column headers.
This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the content of column headers.

The following plugins are known to allow users to define column headers:

* [Warnings NG](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/)
* [Maven Info](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-info/)
* [Link Column](https://plugins.jenkins.io/link-column/)

Further plugins may also allow users to define column headers.

Jenkins no longer processes HTML embedded in list view column headers.

### Passwords stored in plain text by Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1542 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2164**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin 3.5.0 and earlier stores its Artifactory server password in plain text in the global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml`.
This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 now stores the Artifactory server password encrypted.
This change is effective once the global configuration is saved the next time.

### Passwords transmitted in plain text by Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1542 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2165**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin stores Artifactory server passwords in its global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Artifactory Plugin 3.6.1 transmits the password in its global configuration encrypted.

### RCE vulnerability in Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin

**SECURITY-1741
/
CVE-2020-2166**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-aws`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-aws)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.40 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin’s build steps.

Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.41 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### RCE vulnerability in OpenShift Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1739
/
CVE-2020-2167**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`openshift-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/openshift-pipeline)**

**Description:**

OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.56 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to OpenShift Pipeline Plugin’s build step.

OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.57 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### RCE vulnerability in Azure Container Service Plugin

**SECURITY-1732
/
CVE-2020-2168**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-acs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-acs)**

**Description:**

Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to Azure Container Service Plugin’s build step.

Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.2 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Queue cleanup Plugin

**SECURITY-1724
/
CVE-2020-2169**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`queue-cleanup`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/queue-cleanup)**

**Description:**

A form validation HTTP endpoint in Queue cleanup Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not escape a query parameter displayed in an error message.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

Queue cleanup Plugin 1.4 correctly escapes the query parameter.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in RapidDeploy Plugin

**SECURITY-1676
/
CVE-2020-2170**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`rapiddeploy-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rapiddeploy-jenkins)**

**Description:**

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not escape package names in its displayed table of packages obtained from a remote server.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs.

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2.1 escapes package names.

### XXE vulnerability in RapidDeploy Plugin

**SECURITY-1677
/
CVE-2020-2171**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`rapiddeploy-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rapiddeploy-jenkins)**

**Description:**

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'RapidDeploy deployment package build' build or post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

SECURITY-1774 / CVE-2020-2160
An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.

Implementations of that extension point received a different representation
of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier. This discrepancy
allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of
any target URL.

SECURITY-1781 / CVE-2020-2161
Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes. These
labels can be referenced in job configurations to restrict where a job can
be run.

In Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, the form validation
for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape
label names, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to define node labels.

SECURITY-1793 / CVE-2020-2162
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier served files uploaded as
file parameters to a build without specifying appropriate
`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers. This resulted in a stored
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
permissions to build a job with file parameters.

SECURITY-1796 / CVE-2020-2163
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier processed HTML embedded
in list view column headers. This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the content of
column headers.

The following plugins are known to allow users to define column headers:

* Warnings NG
* Maven Info
* Link Column

Further plugins may also allow users to define column headers.

SECURITY-1542 (1) / CVE-2020-2164
Artifactory Plugin 3.5.0 and earlier stores its Artifactory server password
in plain text in the global configuration file
`org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml`. This password can be viewed by
users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1542 (2) / CVE-2020-2165
Artifactory Plugin stores Artifactory server passwords in its global
configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since Artifactory Plugin
3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by
Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1741 / CVE-2020-2166
Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.40 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin's build steps.

SECURITY-1739 / CVE-2020-2167
OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.56 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to OpenShift Pipeline Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1732 / CVE-2020-2168
Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not configure its
YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results
in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Azure Container Service Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1724 / CVE-2020-2169
A form validation HTTP endpoint in Queue cleanup Plugin 1.3 and earlier
does not escape a query parameter displayed in an error message. This
results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

SECURITY-1676 / CVE-2020-2170
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not escape package names in its
displayed table of packages obtained from a remote server. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able
to configure jobs.

SECURITY-1677 / CVE-2020-2171
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'RapidDeploy
deployment package build' build or post-build step to have Jenkins parse a
crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the
Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.
