Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2163:

**CVE-2020-2163**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by Jenkins processing HTML embedded in list view column headers without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML into column headers. When other users view the list view, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content of column headers, typically through configuration settings.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the permission to configure column headers. The advisory notes that plugins such as Warnings NG, Maven Info, and Link Column allow users to define column headers. Other plugins may also be affected.

**Summary**

CVE-2020-2163 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Jenkins related to the way list view column headers are handled. An attacker with sufficient privileges to modify column headers can inject malicious HTML. This HTML is then rendered in the browsers of other users who view the affected list view, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes.
