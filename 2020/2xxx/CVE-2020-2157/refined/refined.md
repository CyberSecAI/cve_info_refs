Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2157:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content does not contain a specific CVE description, which is represented by "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval". However, it does include information related to the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2157.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stores credentials in the job `config.xml` files. While these credentials are encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text during the configuration form submission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Credentials:** The plugin transmits credentials in plain text as part of the configuration form submission, despite being stored encrypted on the Jenkins master disk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Credentials:** Malicious actors with access to network traffic or browser extensions can intercept the plain text credentials, potentially gaining access to the associated Skytap Cloud environment.
- **Lateral Movement:** Compromised credentials could allow an attacker to further compromise related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the Jenkins server to capture the plain text credentials.
- **Browser Extensions:** Malicious browser extensions could be used to intercept credentials within the browser itself.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** If a cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in Jenkins, it could potentially be used to expose the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access or Browser Level Access:** The attacker needs either the ability to intercept network traffic between a user's browser and the Jenkins instance or the ability to inject malicious scripts into the browser via malicious browser extensions, or similar means like Cross-Site Scripting.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs a user to interact with the configuration form.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Skytap Cloud CI Plugin version 2.07 and earlier.
- There is no fix available as of the publication of the security advisory.
- The credentials are stored in job `config.xml` files.
- Users with "Extended Read" permission are able to view the credentials, which are visible as they are submitted in the configuration form.
