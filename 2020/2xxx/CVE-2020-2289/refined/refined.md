Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2289:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Active Choices Plugin versions 2.4 and earlier do not properly escape the name and description fields of build parameters. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin is vulnerable to XSS because it renders unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the build parameter's name or description. When a user views the job configuration, this injected script would execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking.
*   Stealing sensitive information.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   Other malicious activities within the user's context.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious build parameter name or description. This would be introduced during the configuration of a Jenkins job.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the Jenkins Job/Configure permission to modify job configurations.

**Additional details:**
The provided information contains a security advisory and a plugin description that includes:
