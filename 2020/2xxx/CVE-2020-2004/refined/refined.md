Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the GlobalProtect app logging user passwords in cleartext within the `PanGPS.log` diagnostic file when specific conditions are met.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Password Logging:** The primary weakness is the storage of user passwords in an unencrypted format within a log file, which is a type of information exposure.
- **Information Exposure through Debug Log Files (CWE-534):** This is the specific CWE associated with this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (HIGH):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to user passwords, which can lead to unauthorized access to systems, accounts and sensitive data.
- **Integrity Impact (HIGH):** With user credentials, an attacker could potentially modify data or settings if they gain access to the affected systems/accounts.
- **Availability Impact (LOW):** Although the confidentiality and integrity impacts are high, the impact on system availability is low in this case.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local (AV:L):** The attacker must have local access to the system running the vulnerable GlobalProtect app where the `PanGPS.log` is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have access to the file system where the logs are stored.
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker needs to have low level privileges on the system to access the log file.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The user must manually initiate the collection of troubleshooting logs with a specific logging level ("Dump").
- **Specific Conditions:** The 'Save User Credential' option has to be set to 'Yes', and the user must manually select a gateway.

**Additional details:**
- The issue specifically affects GlobalProtect app versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.9 and 5.1 prior to 5.1.2 on Windows and macOS.
- The vulnerability does not affect other platforms like iOS, Android, or Linux.
- Palo Alto Networks has taken measures to delete affected logs and filter credentials from files sent to customer support.
- Multiple workarounds and mitigations exist, such as not using the "Dump" logging level, disabling credential saving, or using Single-Sign-On.
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by Palo Alto Networks.
