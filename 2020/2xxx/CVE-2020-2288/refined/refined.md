Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2288:

**CVE-2020-2288**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Audit Trail Plugin uses regular expressions to match requested URLs for logging. The default regular expression pattern in versions 3.6 and earlier could be bypassed by adding a suffix to the URL, which would be ignored during request handling.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Default Regular Expression:** The default regular expression pattern used for matching URLs to be logged was insufficient and could be easily bypassed.
    *   **Insufficient Validation:** The plugin did not properly validate user-provided patterns to ensure they would not be bypassable.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Bypassed Audit Logs:** Attackers could craft URLs to bypass the logging mechanism, making it harder to detect malicious activities.
    *   **Loss of Audit Trail Integrity:** The ability to bypass logging undermines the purpose of the audit trail, making it unreliable for security monitoring and investigations.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted URLs:** An attacker could construct specific URLs with suffixes that bypass the default logging pattern.
    *   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending HTTP requests with crafted URLs to the Jenkins server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Specific Privileges:** No specific user privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability. An unauthenticated user can send a request and bypass the logging.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins server to send the crafted HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Audit Trail Plugin versions 3.6 and earlier.
*   Version 3.7 of the plugin addresses the issue by changing the default regular expression pattern to allow for arbitrary suffixes and by providing an administrative monitor to detect bypassable user-specified patterns.
*   Form validation was improved in version 3.7 to prevent users from specifying patterns that would not match requests with arbitrary suffixes.
