Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-2121:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin does not properly configure its YAML parser. It fails to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of YAML parsing, specifically not restricting the types that can be instantiated.
*   **Impact:** This allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can provide malicious YAML input files to the Google Kubernetes Engine Pluginâ€™s build step.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide YAML input files to a build step configured to use the vulnerable plugin. This typically implies that the attacker has the ability to configure jobs or pipelines using this plugin. The attacker needs to have at least Job/Configure permissions to be able to specify the YAML input file.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerability exists in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin version 0.8.0 and earlier.
*   Version 0.8.1 configures the YAML parser to only instantiate safe types, resolving the issue.
