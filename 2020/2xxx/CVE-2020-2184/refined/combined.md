## Descriptions

### Secrets are not masked by Credentials Binding Plugin in builds without build steps

**SECURITY-1374
/
CVE-2020-2181**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets when the build contains no build steps.
Â

### Improper masking of some secrets in Credentials Binding Plugin

**SECURITY-1835
/
CVE-2020-2182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`.
This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`).
This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.

### Improper permission checks in Copy Artifact Plugin

**SECURITY-988
/
CVE-2020-2183**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copyartifact`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact)**

**Description:**

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build.
This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts.
When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained ("Migration mode").
To enable the additional protections, switch to the new "Production mode".
Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts.
For more information see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).

### CSRF vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-1094
/
CVE-2020-2184**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

CVS Plugin 2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing SSH host key validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-381
/
CVE-2020-2185**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 provides strategies for performing host key validation for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
It includes assistance for administrators to migrate to a new, more secure strategy.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-unix-amis).

### CSRF vulnerability in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1408
/
CVE-2020-2186**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows an attacker to provision instances with an attacker-specified template ID.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1528
/
CVE-2020-2187**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation.
A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis).

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1844
/
CVE-2020-2188**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### RCE vulnerability in SCM Filter Jervis Plugin

**SECURITY-1826
/
CVE-2020-2189**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`scm-filter-jervis`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scm-filter-jervis)**

**Description:**

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

# Copy Artifact plugin

Adds a build step to copy artifacts from another project.

The plugin lets you specify which build to copy artifacts from (e.g. the
last successful/stable build, by build number, or by a build parameter).
You can also control the copying process by filtering the files being
copied, specifying a destination directory within the target project,
etc. Click the help icon on each field to learn the details, such as
selecting Maven or multiconfiguration projects or using build
parameters. You can also copy from the workspace of the latest completed
build of the source project, instead of its artifacts. All artifacts
copied are automatically
[fingerprinted](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/fingerprints/) for
you.

[![image](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot-copy-artefacts.png)](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/screenshot-copy-artefacts.png)

## Pipeline syntax

* To copy artifacts from the latest stable build of "sourceproject"

  ```
  copyArtifacts(projectName: 'sourceproject');
  ```
* To copy artifacts from the specific build of "downstream"

  ```
  def built = build('downstream');  // https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-build-step
  copyArtifacts(projectName: 'downstream', selector: specific("${built.number}"));
  ```
* Parameters of copyArtifacts

  | parameter | type | description |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | projectName | string | the name of project (required) |
  | selector | BuildSelector | the selector to select the build to copy from. If not specified, latest stable build is used. |
  | parameters | string | comma-separated name and value pairs (name1=value1,name2=value2) to filter the build to copy from. |
  | filter | string | ant-expression to filter artifacts to copy |
  | excludes | string | ant-expression to exclude artifacts to copy |
  | target | string | target directory to copy to |
  | flatten | boolean | ignore directory structures of artifacts |
  | optional | boolean | do not fail the step even if no appropriate build is found. |
  | fingerprintArtifacts | boolean | fingerprint artifacts to track builds using those artifacts. false for default if the parameter isn’t specified (Snippet Generator defaults this to true and specifies the parameter). |
  | resultVariableSuffix | boolean | useless for pipelines |
  | includeBuildNumberInTargetPath | boolean | Include source build number in target path. |
* selectors

  | name | feature |
  | --- | --- |
  | lastSuccessful | Latest successful build |
  | specific | Specific build |
  | permalink | Specified by permalink |
  | lastCompleted | completed build (ignoring build status) |
  | latestSavedBuild | Latest saved build (marked "keep forever") |
  | buildParameter | Specified by a build parameter |
  | upstream | Upstream build that triggered this job |

## Configuration Notes

* When using this plugin with a Windows agent node that is configured as
  a Windows service, the service should have permission to interact with
  desktop (select "Allow service to interact with desktop" from Jenkins
  Agent service properties). Otherwise you may see errors similar to this:

  ```
  ERROR: Failed to copy artifacts from ...
  hudson.util.IOException2: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class hudson.remoting.Pipe$ConnectCommand cannot
    access its superclass hudson.remoting.Command
  at hudson.FilePath.copyRecursiveTo(FilePath.java:1526)
  at hudson.FilePath.copyRecursiveTo(FilePath.java:1451)
  at hudson.plugins.copyartifact.FilePathCopyMethod.copyAll(FilePathCopyMethod.java:51)
  ...
  ```

## Recommended usage of copy artifact

* Artifacts should be stored as archived files.

  + Copyartifact tries to copy artifacts preserving file attributes like
    permissions and symbolic links. Though, it may fail in some situations
    (like for security issues).
  + It’s highly recommended to pack files to copy into an archive file,
    using `tar` command
    or [`zip`
    pipeline step](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-utility-steps/#zip-create-zip-file), especially when it’s important for you to preserving

## Permissions to copy artifact

| Note | Since version 1.44, Copy Artifact checks permissions more thoroughly in its default Production mode. If you have permission issues when upgrading from copyartifact 1.43.1 or earlier you can use [Migration Mode](#CopyArtifactPlugin-MigrationMode). You should convert to Production mode as soon as possible. |
| --- | --- |

When you face a following message and fail to copy artifacts, this may
be caused by permission to the job with artifacts. Please read this
section once.

```
Unable to find project for artifact copy: YOUR_PROJECT_WITH_ARTIFACTS
This may be due to incorrect project name or permission settings; see help for project name in job configuration.
Build step 'Copy artifacts from another project' marked build as failure
```

You can configure to allow Copy Artifact to access source jobs in the following ways.

* [Configure source jobs specifying jobs who can copy artifacts.](#CopyArtifactPlugin-Specifyprojectswhocancopyartifacts)
* [Authorize builds as a user.](#CopyArtifactPlugin-Authorizebuildsasauser)

The message will not be encountered if the "Authenticated" user group has the "job/read" permission enabled.
If this issue appears on your controller, check if this configuration has recently changed.

#### Specify projects who can copy artifacts

* In the job configuration pages, you can specify jobs to allow
  copy artifacts from that project:

  [![image](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/permissions_06_copypermission.png)](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/permissions_06_copypermission.png)
* Use `copyArtifactPermission` in pipelines:

  + Declarative pipeline:

    ```
    pipeline {
        agent any;
        options {
            copyArtifactPermission('job1,job2,...');
        }
        stages{...}
    }
    ```
  + Scripted pipeline

    ```
    properties([
        copyArtifactPermission('job1,job2,...'),
    ]);
    node {
        ...
    }
    ```
* You can specify multiple jobs separated by commas.
* You can use wildcard character ('\*') to specify name patterns.

#### Authorize builds as a user

* [Authorize Project plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project/) enables you to run builds of a project as a specific user.

  + Copy Artifact treats builds running as anonymous without authorization configurations.
* You can resolve permission problems by running builds as a user with read permission to the project with artifacts

### Migration Mode

Migration mode is available and automatically enabled for users upgrading Copy Artifact from 1.43.1 or earlier.

Migration mode performs permission checks when configuring jobs
or when running builds if the name of the source job is
configured with variables.
This is the behavior compatible to Copy Artifact 1.43.1 or earlier.

This may cause security vulnerabilities allowing malicious users
to bypass permission checks.
This mode is provided only to allow users to upgrade job configurations
and migrate to Production mode easily. You should migrate to Production mode as soon as you can.

Build executions that would fail in Production mode are
recorded and displayed as warnings to administrators.

[![migration mode warnings](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/migrationmode-monitor.png)](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/migrationmode-monitor.png)

Administrators should check those warnings
and update the job configurations to successfully use Production mode.

[![Migration helper](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/migrationmode-helper.png)](/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/migrationmode-helper.png)

## Use with declarative pipelines

One example:

```
stages {
    stage('Copy Archive') {
         steps {
             script {
                step ([$class: 'CopyArtifact',
                    projectName: 'Create_archive',
                    filter: "packages/infra*.zip",
                    target: 'Infra']);
            }
        }
    }
...
}
```

What that is doing:

* Go to the project/workspace named "Create\_archive".
* Look in the folder "packages" for the file(s) "infra\*.zip".
* Copy that file(s) into the folder "Infra", in the local workspace.
  Folder will be created if it doesn’t already exist.

SECURITY-1374 / CVE-2020-2181
Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace
with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build
steps.

SECURITY-1835 / CVE-2020-2182
Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as
environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As
a side effect of the fix for SECURITY-698, `$` characters in secrets are
escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is
passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form
of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the "Execute
Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

SECURITY-988 / CVE-2020-2183
Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks
when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project
build. This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to
configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to
access.

SECURITY-1094 / CVE-2020-2184
CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP
endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an
attacker-specified URL.

SECURITY-381 / CVE-2020-2185
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation
when connecting to agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1408 / CVE-2020-2186
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an
attacker-specified template ID.

SECURITY-1528 / CVE-2020-2187
Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed
HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting
to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1844 / CVE-2020-2188
Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2
Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission
to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1826 / CVE-2020-2189
SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.
