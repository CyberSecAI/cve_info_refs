Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2271:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-2271

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Plugin:** Locked Files Report Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.6 and earlier

**Root Cause:** The Locked Files Report Plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the names of locked files before displaying them in tooltips. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the file names.

**Weakness:** Insufficient output sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data (file names) displayed within tooltips.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser when the victim hovers over tooltips containing the malicious file names. This could lead to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Stealing sensitive information
   - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
   - Defacing the web page

**Attack Vector:**
   - An attacker would need to create or modify job configurations to include files with malicious names, which will be displayed in the plugin's tooltips.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have `Job/Configure` permissions to modify jobs and inject the malicious file names.
