Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SMS Notification Plugin stores the access token used for communication with the SMS service in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** The access token is stored unencrypted. This is a significant security vulnerability, as anyone gaining access to the configuration file can read the token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access Token Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller file system can read the access token.
- **Unauthorized SMS Sending:** With the access token, an attacker can potentially send unauthorized SMS messages using the configured SMS service account, potentially incurring costs or causing other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could happen through various means, such as:
    - Compromising the server running Jenkins.
    - Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow file system access.
    - Gaining physical access to the server.
    - Exploiting misconfigured access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Jenkins Controller File System:** An attacker needs to be able to read the file `com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller. This implies they need some level of access to the server on which Jenkins is running.  This could be achieved with low level of privileges
