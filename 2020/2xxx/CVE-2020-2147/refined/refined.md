The provided content contains details about multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2020-2147.

**CVE-2020-2147 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Mac Plugin (versions 1.1.0 and earlier) does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation and does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:**  Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can connect to an attacker-specified SSH host using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerable form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage the lack of permission checks and CSRF vulnerability to connect to an attacker-controlled SSH server, potentially capturing credentials from Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request, targeting the form validation method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to specify a malicious SSH host.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain valid credential IDs through another method.
