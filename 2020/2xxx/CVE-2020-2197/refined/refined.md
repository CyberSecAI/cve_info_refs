Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Project Inheritance Plugin does not perform permission checks on its `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` API endpoint. This endpoint is intended to provide job configuration XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user accessing the `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` endpoint has the necessary `Job/ExtendedRead` permission (typically granted through `Job/Configure`). This allows any user with `Job/Read` permissions to access sensitive job configuration data.
*   **Unredacted Encrypted Secrets:** The plugin does not redact encrypted secret values in the configuration XML when accessed via the vulnerable endpoint. This exposes sensitive information that would normally be hidden from users without `Job/Configure` permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a job's configuration XML data, including potentially sensitive encrypted secrets, even if they do not have `Job/Configure` permission. This information can be used to understand the job's configuration, identify other attack vectors or steal the secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with `Job/Read` permission can send a request to the `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` API endpoint to retrieve the job's configuration XML, thereby exploiting the missing permission check.
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Jenkins instance, and have `Job/Read` permission on the target job, which is a relatively low barrier to entry in most systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker must have the `Job/Read` permission for the target project in Jenkins.
