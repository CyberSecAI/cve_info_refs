## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1866
/
CVE-2020-2190**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

Script Security Plugin 1.73 escapes pending and approved classpath entries before rendering them in the Jenkins UI.

### CSRF vulnerability and improper permission checks in Swarm Plugin

**SECURITY-1200
/
CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks), CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels.
In Swarm Plugin 3.20 and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed.
This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Swarm Plugin 3.21 requires POST requests and Agent/Configure permission for the affected agent to these endpoints.
It no longer uses the global Swarm secret for these API endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1841
/
CVE-2020-2193**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the parser identifier.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1842
/
CVE-2020-2194**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the display name.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Compact Columns Plugin

**SECURITY-1837
/
CVE-2020-2195**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compact-columns`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compact-columns)**

**Description:**

Compact Columns Plugin 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job description in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Compact Columns Plugin 1.12 applies the configured markup formatter to the job description shown in tooltips.

### Complete lack of CSRF protection in Selenium Plugin can lead to OS command injection

**SECURITY-1766
/
CVE-2020-2196**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`selenium`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/selenium)**

**Description:**

Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result in OS command injection on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin

**SECURITY-1582
/
CVE-2020-2197 (permission check), CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission.
Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.

Project Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.

Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XSS vulnerability in Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin

**SECURITY-1726
/
CVE-2020-2199**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`svn-partial-release-mgr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/svn-partial-release-mgr)**

**Description:**

Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### OS command injection vulnerability in Play Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1879
/
CVE-2020-2200**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`play-autotest-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/play-autotest-plugin)**

**Description:**

A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.

Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins controller.
This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins controller (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1842 / CVE-2020-2194

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result
in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1582 / CVE-2020-2197 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)

SECURITY-1726 / CVE-2020-2199
Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape
