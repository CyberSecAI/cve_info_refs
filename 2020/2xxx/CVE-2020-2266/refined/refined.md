**CVE-2020-2266**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Description Column Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not properly escape the job description in the column tooltips.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/encoding
*   **Impact:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the column tooltips.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the job description.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs `Job/Configure` permission.

**Summary:**

The Description Column Plugin versions 1.3 and earlier are vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. The vulnerability exists because the plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied job descriptions before rendering them in tooltips. An attacker with Job/Configure permission can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the job description, which can lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, or further compromising of the system.
