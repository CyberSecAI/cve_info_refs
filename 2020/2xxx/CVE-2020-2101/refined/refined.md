  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-2101",
      "related_content": true,
      "summary": "Jenkins does not use a constant-time comparison validating the connection secret when an inbound TCP agent connection is initiated.",
      "details": "Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison validating the connection secret when an inbound TCP agent connection is initiated. This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain the connection secret.",
      "affected_versions": [
        "Jenkins 2.218 and earlier",
        "Jenkins LTS 2.204.1 and earlier"
      ],
      "fix_versions": [
        "Jenkins 2.219",
        "Jenkins LTS 2.204.2"
      ],
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant time comparison when validating the connection secret during inbound TCP agent connection initiation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Timing attack vulnerability due to non-constant time comparison of the connection secret."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially obtain the connection secret using statistical methods. This could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate agent and potentially gain access to the Jenkins controller.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack targeting the inbound TCP agent connection process"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TCP connection to the Jenkins controller and observe the timing of the connection secret validation process. They also need some control over the environment or be able to perform statistical analysis"
