### Description

An information exposure vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks Panorama software that discloses the token for the Panorama web interface administrator's session to a managed device when the Panorama administrator performs a context switch into that device. This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain privileged access to the Panorama web interface. An attacker requires some knowledge of managed firewalls to exploit this issue.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.17;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.11;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | None | 10.0.\* |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.5 | >= 9.1.5 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.11 | >= 9.0.11 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.17 | >= 8.1.17 |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is not applicable when custom certificate authentication is enabled between Panorama and managed firewalls. See <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/10-0/panorama-admin/set-up-panorama/set-up-authentication-using-custom-certificates.html>

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
7.5 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-200 Information Exposure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.17, PAN-OS 9.0.11, PAN-OS 9.1.5, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue can be completely mitigated by enabling custom certificate authentication between Panorama and managed firewalls. See <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/10-0/panorama-admin/set-up-panorama/set-up-authentication-using-custom-certificates.html>

This issue impacts the management web interface of appliances running PAN-OS software and is strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the interface. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices>
