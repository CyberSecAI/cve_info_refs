Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A discrepancy exists between how the Audit Trail Plugin and the Stapler web framework parse URL paths. The plugin uses a configured regular expression to determine which requests to log, however, due to the discrepancy, attackers can craft URLs that bypass the logging mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Request Logging:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the Audit Trail Plugin's request logging by crafting specific URLs. This is due to inconsistent URL path parsing between the plugin and the underlying Stapler framework.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reduced Auditability:** The exploitation results in the plugin failing to log specific requests. This compromises the audit trail, making it harder to track malicious or unauthorized actions taken on the Jenkins instance. An attacker could perform actions without them being logged.
*  **Lack of Visibility:** Successful exploitation would provide a way for attackers to hide their activities on the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with URLs designed to bypass the regular expression matching of the Audit Trail plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins instance.
*   **No Authentication Required**: This vulnerability does not require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to Jenkins versions 2.227 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, because a fix in Stapler web framework (SECURITY-1774) prohibits dispatch of the affected requests.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves aligning the Audit Trail Plugin's URL path parsing with the Stapler web framework's.
