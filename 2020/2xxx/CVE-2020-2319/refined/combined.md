Add VMware Lab Manager support to Jenkins

### Description

This plugin add to Jenkins CI a way to control Virtual Machines hosted
on [VMware Lab Manager](http://www.vmware.com/products/labmanager/). You
can configure a Jenkins Slave, selecting a virtual machine from a
Organization / Workspace / Configuration triplet, in this way, when you
need to build a Job on a specific Slave, this VM will be startup up and
shutdown or suspended again after the build process.

### Requirements

To rebuild the WSDL2Java created files you will need to install Axis2
and use the wsdl2java program. All runtime requirements are included.

### Configuration

##### Lab Manager cloud

The first step is to configure Hudson to know what configuration in Lab
Manager you will be using. To do this you need to add a new "Cloud" in
the Hudson "Configure System" menu.

The required parameters to setup are:

* **LabManager Host**: The base URI of the Lab Manager host, e.g.
  <https://example.server/>
* **Brief description of this overall configuration**: A textual
  description of this "cloud" that will be used when choosing Virtual
  Machines for slaves
* **LabManager Organization**: The Organization name in Lab Manager
  where the virtual machines reside.
* **LabManager Configuration**: The Configuration name in Lab Manager
  where the virtual machines reside.
* **Username**: username to use to connect with Lab Manager
* **Password**: the password for this account

If you need some other particular settings, you can click on the
*Advanced* button to change the default parameters.

* **LabManager Workspace**: The Workspace name in Lab Manager where
  the virtual machines reside. If not listed the default of "main"
  will be used.
* **Max number of slaves online**: A limit on the number of VMs in
  this cloud that can be on at any given time.

To verify all you parameters you can click on *Test* button and check
the output reported.

##### Slaves

Now you can setup your nodes in hudson and use them to build your
projects.

On the creation page you just simply select the correct radio button to
configure a slave that runs inside of Lab Manager.

Going ahead with configuration you can see a page that looks like the
normal node creation page, with three combo box added. The first one
where you have to select the Lab Manager instance (the brief description
provided in the configuration section). In the second one you pick the
name of the Virtual Machine in Lab Manager configuration that you are
using. In the third drop down you select the action to be taken when the
VM is idle (it is recommended to pick shutdown over suspend due to
overhead in Lab Manager).

If you then select the option to have the slave be taken on or offline
based on demand. Note that if you select Shutdown or Shutdown and Revert
for an idle behavior the slave will not be available immediately. It
will however come online once demand is polled a second time. Next, if
using a JNLP slave (ie for Windows), you must check the **Force VM
launch** option. Doing this along with the normal best practices to have
a Windows slave turn on and auto-start the JNLP client is all that is
required specially for Windows. Finally, you can set the delay between
telling Lab Manger to get the VM online and Jenkins attempting to
connect to it as a slave. This value is in seconds. All slaves must have
the VMware Tools installed in order for it to be cleanly managed.

## Descriptions

### Login allowed with hardcoded password by Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-2117
/
CVE-2020-2299**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Critical](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

The LDAP-based mode in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier shares code between user lookup and user authentication and distinguishes these behaviors through the use of a magic constant used in place of a real password.
This allows attackers to log in as any user if the magic constant is used as the password in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier.

Active Directory Plugin 2.20 no longer uses a magic constant to distinguish between user lookup and user authentication.

### Login allowed with empty password by Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-2099
/
CVE-2020-2300**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

The Windows/ADSI mode does not specifically prohibit use of empty passwords in Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier.
If the Active Directory server allows the unauthenticated bind operation, this allows attackers to log in to Jenkins as any user by providing an empty password.

Active Directory Plugin 2.20 prohibits the use of an empty password to log in.

### Authentication cache in Active Directory Plugin allows logging in with any password

**SECURITY-2123
/
CVE-2020-2301**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.
Optionally, to reduce lookup time, a cache can be configured to remember user lookups and user authentications.

In Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier, when run in Windows/ADSI mode, the provided password was not used when looking up an applicable cache entry.
This allows attackers to log in as any user using any password while a successful authentication of that user is still in the cache.

As a workaround for this issue, the cache can be disabled.

Active Directory Plugin 2.20 includes the provided password in cache entry lookup.

Additionally, the Java system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.CacheUtil.noCacheAuth` can be set to `true` to no longer cache user authentications.

### Missing permission check in Active Directory Plugin allows accessing domain health check page

**SECURITY-1999
/
CVE-2020-2302**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin 2.19 and earlier does not require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints implementing connection and authentication tests, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability allows attackers to perform connection tests, connecting to attacker-specified or previously configured Active Directory servers using attacker-specified credentials.

Active Directory Plugin 2.20 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### XXE vulnerability in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-2145
/
CVE-2020-2304**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)
