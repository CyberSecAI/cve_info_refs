Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-2152:

**CVE-2020-2152**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Subversion Release Manager Plugin does not properly escape the error message for the Repository URL field during form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of a user's browser session when the user views the error message. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to inject malicious code into the "Repository URL" field, which is then reflected in the error message displayed to a user with Job/Configure permissions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires the ability to manipulate the "Repository URL" field within the pluginâ€™s settings, and needs to trick a user with Job/Configure permission into visiting a page with the crafted URL to trigger the XSS.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, but can be exploited similar to a stored XSS by enticing a user with the required permissions to trigger the exploit.
*   The advisory states that as of the publication date, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
