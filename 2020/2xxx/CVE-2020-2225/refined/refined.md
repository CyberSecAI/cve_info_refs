Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2225:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Matrix Project Plugin versions 1.16 and earlier do not properly escape the axis names shown in tooltips on the overview page of builds with multiple axes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The unescaped axis names allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the build overview page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can potentially lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
  - Defacing the Jenkins interface
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Other malicious activities within the Jenkins instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript code into the axis names of a multi-configuration project.
- This injected code will be stored and executed when other users view the build overview page that displays these axis names in tooltips.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have "Job/Configure" permission. This means they can configure the multi-configuration job to include malicious axis names.
