Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the failure of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS to verify the integrity of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) before authenticating users. This lack of verification allows an attacker to spoof the KDC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass due to the lack of KDC integrity verification.
- Spoofing: The vulnerability allows for the spoofing of the KDC server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the PAN-OS system.
- An attacker can gain administrative access to the PAN-OS device.
- Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is required to intercept communication between PAN-OS and the legitimate KDC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the PAN-OS device and the Kerberos KDC.
- The attacker needs the ability to perform a MITM attack.
- No user interaction is required.
- No specific privileges are required for the initial attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all forms of authentication using a Kerberos authentication profile.
- The advisory identifies specific vulnerable versions of PAN-OS, including versions 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.0.
- The issue was discovered externally by researchers from Silverfort.

**Mitigation:**
- Update PAN-OS to the fixed versions: 7.1.26, 8.1.13, 9.0.6, or later.
- Ensure communication with the Kerberos server occurs over a secure network with limited access to trusted users.
- Follow best practices for securing administrative access to PAN-OS.
