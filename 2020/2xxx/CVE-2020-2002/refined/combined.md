### Description

An authentication bypass by spoofing vulnerability exists in the authentication daemon and User-ID components of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS by failing to verify the integrity of the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) before authenticating users. This affects all forms of authentication that use a Kerberos authentication profile. A man-in-the-middle type of attacker with the ability to intercept communication between PAN-OS and KDC can login to PAN-OS as an administrator.

This issue affects:

PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26;

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6;

All version of PAN-OS 8.0.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.6 | >= 9.0.6 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.13 | >= 8.1.13 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | 8.0.\* | None |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | < 7.1.26 | >= 7.1.26 |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.1 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 7.1.26, PAN-OS 8.1.13, PAN-OS 9.0.6, and all later PAN-OS versions.

PAN-OS 8.0 is now end-of-life as of October 31, 2019, and is no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Ensure that PAN-OS communicates to Kerberos server over a secured network with access restricted to trusted users.

Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com>.
