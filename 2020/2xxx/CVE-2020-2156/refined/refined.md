Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2156:

**CVE-2020-2156**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DeployHub Plugin stores credentials within job configuration files (`config.xml`). While these credentials are encrypted at rest, they are transmitted in plain text during the configuration form submission.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Plaintext transmission of credentials during configuration form submissions.
    *   Storage of credentials in job-specific configuration files, potentially exposing them to users with access.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Exposure of credentials via browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar scenarios.
    *   Unauthorized access to systems or services using the exposed credentials.
    *   Users with "Extended Read" permissions can potentially view the credentials.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Attacker intercepts network traffic during configuration form submission.
    *   Attacker gains access to the Jenkins server and config.xml files.
    *   Attacker exploits cross-site scripting (XSS) to capture the credentials.
     *  Malicious browser extensions capturing the credentials.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to intercept network traffic, particularly during form submissions.
    *   Access to Jenkins server filesystem or ability to exploit cross site scripting.
    *   At least "Extended Read" access within Jenkins to view the job configurations.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in DeployHub Plugin versions 8.0.14 and earlier.
*   A fix is not available at the time of publication for this vulnerability.
*   This is classified as a low severity vulnerability.
