Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2309:

**CVE Description:**

The official description for CVE-2020-2309 is: "Missing permission check in Kubernetes Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs".

**Analysis of the provided content:**

The content confirms the CVE description and provides further details.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Kubernetes Plugin lacked a permission check on an HTTP endpoint, leading to unauthorized access.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a permission check before allowing access to the endpoint that enumerates credentials IDs.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Exposure of Credential IDs:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions could enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** This exposure of credential IDs could be a stepping stone for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities to capture the credentials themselves.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through an HTTP endpoint within the Jenkins server.
    *   **Required Permissions:** The attacker needs at least Overall/Read permission within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
    *   The attacker must have valid user credentials within the Jenkins instance, granting them the Overall/Read permission.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in Kubernetes Plugin 1.27.3 and earlier allowed users with Overall/Read permissions to enumerate credential IDs due to a missing permission check on an HTTP endpoint. This could enable further attacks to capture those credentials. The fix in version 1.27.4 implemented the necessary permission checks, requiring appropriate permissions to perform the action.
