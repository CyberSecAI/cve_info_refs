PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 7.1.26;

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.13.

Base Score:
7.2 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-78 OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 7.1.26, PAN-OS 8.1.13, and all later PAN-OS versions.

PAN-OS 8.0 is end-of-life (as of October 31, 2019) and is no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

PAN-OS 7.1 is on extended support until June 30, 2020, and we are considering updates only for critical security vulnerability fixes.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the management interface of PAN-OS and you can mitigate the impact of this issue by following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices>.
