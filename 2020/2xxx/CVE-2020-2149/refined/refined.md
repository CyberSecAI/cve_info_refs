The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins.

**CVE-2020-2149**

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Repository Connector Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file. While the credentials are encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Credentials transmitted in plain text.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or similar situations.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could potentially intercept the plain text credentials during transmission, possibly via browser extensions or XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker would need to be in a position to observe the network traffic or have the ability to execute code within the browser of an authenticated user who is interacting with the plugin's configuration form. This could be achieved by exploiting a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

The advisory notes that as of its publication, there is no fix available for this vulnerability in the Repository Connector Plugin.
