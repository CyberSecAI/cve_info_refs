Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2127:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The BMC Release Package and Deployment Plugin stores the RPD user token unencrypted in its global configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of sensitive information: The RPD user token, which is used for authentication against RPD, is stored in plain text within the plugin's configuration file.
- Lack of encryption: The plugin does not utilize any form of encryption to protect the stored user token.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of credentials:  Users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the configuration file and obtain the RPD user token.
- Unauthorized access: An attacker with the RPD user token can potentially gain unauthorized access to the BMC Release Package and Deployment system, depending on the privileges associated with the compromised token.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the Jenkins controller file system: An attacker needs access to the file system where Jenkins is installed to locate and read the plugin's configuration file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller's file system: The attacker needs to be able to directly access the file system of the Jenkins server where the configuration file is located. This might involve compromised accounts with shell access or other server-level breaches.
- Local access: The vulnerability requires access to the local file system of the Jenkins controller, making it a local or internal threat.
