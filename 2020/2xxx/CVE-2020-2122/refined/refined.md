Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Brakeman Plugin did not properly escape values received from parsed JSON files before rendering them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of escaping allowed for the injection of malicious scripts that would be stored and executed within the context of the Jenkins user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the Jenkins application. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Manipulation of the user interface
    *   Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to control the Brakeman post-build step input data, specifically the content of the JSON files that the plugin parses and uses for rendering. This means an attacker would have to be able to influence the content of the build output.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin renders the unescaped data on the user interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to control the input data of the Brakeman post-build step. This typically requires the Job/Configure permission which allows modification of job settings.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Brakeman Plugin version 0.13, which escapes the affected values from the parsed file.
*   Historical data recorded before the fix is applied might still contain unsafe values, highlighting that the fix addresses new data going forward, and doesn't clean up old data.
