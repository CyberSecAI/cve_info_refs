Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2229:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Jenkins core did not properly escape the tooltip content of help icons.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the tooltip, which would then be executed in the browser of any user who views the tooltip.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or modifying the content of the page.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to contribute a crafted tooltip value (this is often done via plugins, some of which use user-specified values) that includes malicious javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to contribute values that will be used as tooltip content, often through a plugin.
- User with low privileges can trigger the XSS.
- The user viewing the page will trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in Jenkins versions 2.251 and earlier, and LTS 2.235.3 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Jenkins versions 2.252 and LTS 2.235.4, which now properly escape tooltip content.
