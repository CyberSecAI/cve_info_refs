# Yet Another Build Visualizer

How to install

* [Documentation](/yet-another-build-visualizer/)
* [Releases](/yet-another-build-visualizer/releases/)
* [Issues](/yet-another-build-visualizer/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/yet-another-build-visualizer/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/yet-another-build-visualizer/healthscore/)

A Jenkins plugin that allows visualization of the build flow of upstream and downstream builds in Jenkins.

## Screenshots

[![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/master/static/yabv.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/master/static/yabv.png)

*With all info switches enabled:*

[![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/master/static/yabv_toggles.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/master/static/yabv_toggles.png)

## Main Features

* It displays not only downstream builds, but the *full* build flow. In the screenshot above, the build currently visited is highlighted using a thick dashed border.
* Since the full chain is shown, the plugin provides easy and fast navigation between all executed builds in the pipeline.
* Sports nice and modern interface.
* It is compatible with all build types in Jenkins and all known mechanisms of triggering downstream builds.
* Switches to enable displaying of build history, build time information, and to show/hide upstream builds.
* Provides visualization without adding actions or tagging builds in Jenkins with additional meta-data, hence it is totally non-destructive and safe for removal without risking serialization issues.

## Usage

* No configuration is needed, just install the plugin and you are ready to go.
* The "Build Flow"-graph (as seen in the screenshot above) can be found on the Project page (shows the graph for the latest build) or on the Build status page. The graph is only shown for builds that has at least one upstream or downstream job.
* Click the build links to go to the status page of that build. Note that all links are decorated with drop down menus, allowing quick access to common pages (console, parameters info, etc).
* This plugin currently only supports Classic UI. Blue Ocean support may follow in future versions.
* The intervals at which the Build Flow graph refreshes (default: *10000ms*) can be overridden using the Java System Property `yabv.buildFlowRefreshInterval`. The expected unit is ms. E.g. `-D yabv.buildFlowRefreshInterval=5000`. Notice that the unit suffix is not included. Set `yabv.buildFlowRefreshInterval=0` to completely disable the dynamic graph updates.
* Click the switches "Toggle Time" and "Toggle Build History" to display additional data.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for release details.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yet-another-build-visualizer-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Plug-in Dependencies

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1955 / CVE-2020-2229
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
tooltip content of help icons. Tooltip values can be contributed by
plugins, some of which use user-specified values.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1957 / CVE-2020-2230
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
project naming strategy description that is displayed on item creation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Overall/Manage permission.

SECURITY-1960 / CVE-2020-2231
Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the
remote address of the host starting a build via 'Trigger builds remotely'.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission or knowledge of the
Authentication Token.

SECURITY-1975 / CVE-2020-2232
Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in its global configuration
file `hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While this password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and
displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form by Email
Extension Plugin 2.72 and 2.73. This can result in exposure of the
password.

SECURITY-1794 (1) / CVE-2020-2233
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to enumerate
credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part
of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1794 (2) / CVE-2020-2234 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2235 (CSRF)
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1940 / CVE-2020-2236
Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin 1.11 and earlier does not escape
tooltip content.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1763 / CVE-2020-2237
Flaky Test Handler Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not require POST requests
for the "Deflake this build" feature, resulting in a cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to rebuild a project at a previous git
revision where the tests were failing.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
