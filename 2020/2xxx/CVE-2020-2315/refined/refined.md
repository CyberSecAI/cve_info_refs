Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-2315:

**CVE-2020-2315**

*   **Root Cause:** The Visualworks Store Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **XXE Vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser processes external entities, allowing attackers to inject malicious XML code.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller using crafted XML files.
    *  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers might be able to make the Jenkins controller perform requests to internal or external systems.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Agent Process Control:** Attackers can control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file.
    *   **Control over Visualworks Script Output:** Attackers can control the output of a script that runs Visualworks with StoreCI, allowing them to inject malicious XML via the output that Jenkins will parse.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to control an agent process or the output of a Visualworks script using StoreCI
    *   Low-level access (Overall/Read) is required to trigger the vulnerability through the processing of a malicious file.

**Affected Plugin:** Visualworks Store Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.1.3 and earlier.

**Fixed Version:** 1.1.4

The fix disables external entity resolution for the plugin's XML parser.
