Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Amazon EC2 Plugin prior to version 1.50.2 did not require POST requests for several HTTP endpoints. This allowed for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin's lack of enforcement for POST requests on certain endpoints makes it susceptible to CSRF attacks. This means an attacker could potentially trick a user into performing actions on their behalf without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Instance Provisioning:** An attacker could exploit the CSRF vulnerability to provision new EC2 instances using an attacker-specified template ID. This could lead to the consumption of resources, potential data breaches, or other malicious activities depending on the configured template.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email containing a link or embedded form that, when accessed by a logged-in Jenkins user, would trigger the vulnerable endpoints, provisioning EC2 instances with an attacker-specified template ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Victim's Browser:** The attacker would require a logged-in Jenkins user to visit their malicious page or open a crafted email.
*   **No Direct Access to Jenkins:** The attacker does not need direct access to the Jenkins server. They exploit the user's session and trust between the browser and the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in version 1.50.2 requires POST requests for the vulnerable endpoints, preventing CSRF attacks by ensuring actions are intentionally initiated from the Jenkins UI.
*   The advisory notes this vulnerability as "low" severity, likely due to the requirement for user interaction (clicking on a malicious link while logged in) for exploitation.

In summary, CVE-2020-2186 is a CSRF vulnerability in the Amazon EC2 Plugin which could allow an attacker to provision EC2 instances via a victim's session.
