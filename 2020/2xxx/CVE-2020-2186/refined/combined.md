Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2
* Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44
* Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23
* CVS Plugin 2.16
* SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-05-06/>?

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1374 / CVE-2020-2181
Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace
with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build
steps.

SECURITY-1835 / CVE-2020-2182
Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as
environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As
a side effect of the fix for SECURITY-698, `$` characters in secrets are
escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is
passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form
of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the "Execute
Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

SECURITY-988 / CVE-2020-2183
Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks
when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project
build. This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to
configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to
access.

SECURITY-1094 / CVE-2020-2184
CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP
endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an
attacker-specified URL.

SECURITY-381 / CVE-2020-2185
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation
when connecting to agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1408 / CVE-2020-2186
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an
attacker-specified template ID.

SECURITY-1528 / CVE-2020-2187
Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed
HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting
to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1844 / CVE-2020-2188
Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2
Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission
to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1826 / CVE-2020-2189
SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.

# Introduction

Allow Jenkins to start agents on
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on demand, and
kill them as they get unused.

With this plugin, if Jenkins notices that your build cluster is
overloaded, it'll start instances using the EC2 API and automatically
connect them as Jenkins agents. When the load goes down, excess EC2
instances will be terminated. This set up allows you to maintain a small
in-house cluster, then spill the spiky build/test loads into EC2 or
another EC2 compatible cloud.

# Usage

First, go to [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and sign
up for the service. Once you've installed the plugin, you navigate to
the main "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System" page, and scroll down
near the bottom to the "Cloud" section. There, you click the "Add a new
cloud" button, and select the "Amazon EC2" option. This will display the
UI for configuring the EC2 plugin.  Then enter the Access Key and Secret
Access Key which act like a username/password (see IAM section).

Because of the way EC2 works, you also need to have an RSA private key that the
cloud has the other half for, to permit sshing into the instances that
are started. Please use the AWS console or any other tool of your choice
to generate the private key to interactively log in to EC2 instances.

Once you have generated the needed private key you must either store it as
a Jenkins `SSH Private Key` credential (and select that credential in your cloud
config).

If you do not want to create a new Jenkins credential you may alterantively store it
in plain text on disk, indicating its file path via the Jenkins system property
`hudson.plugins.ec2.EC2Cloud.sshPrivateKeyFilePath`. If this system property has a non-empty value then
it will override the ssh credential specified in the cloud configuration page. This
approach works well for `k8s` secrets that are mounted in a jenkins container for example.

Once you have put in your Access Key, Secret Access Key, and configured an ssh private key
select a region for the cloud (not shown in screenshot). You may define only one
cloud for each region, and the regions offered in the UI will show only
the regions that you don't already have clouds defined for them.

Use "Test Connection" button to verify that Jenkins can successfully
talk to EC2. If you are using UEC you need to click on Advanced and fill
out the endpoint details for your cluster.

[![](/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/cloud.png)](/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/cloud.png)

Next, configure AMIs that you want to launch. For this, you need to find
the AMI IDs for the OS of your choice.
[Packer](https://packer.io/) is a good tool for doing
that. Jenkins can work with any Unix AMIs. If using an Ubuntu EC2 or UEC
AMI you need to fill out the `rootCommandPrefix` and
`remoteAdmin` fields under `advanced`. Windows is currently somewhat
supported.

Configuring labels allows Jenkins to pick the right AMI to start. For
example, if all your existing agents labeled "solaris" are fully busy
and you have more builds that are tied to the "solaris" label, Jenkins
will start the AMIs that have the "solaris" label.

Init script is the shell script to be run on the newly launched EC2
instance, before Jenkins starts launching a agent agent. If the AMI
doesn't have Java pre-installed, you can do this in the init script.
This is also a good place to install additional packages that you need
for your builds and tests.  The init script is located at
**/tmp/init.sh** and is owned and run by the user account specified in
the "Remote User" field (so use of "sudo" may be required for non-root
accounts).

[![](/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/raw/master/docs/images/ami.png)](/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/ami.png)

Configure several AMIs if you need different OS images.

With this setting, your Jenkins will automatically start instances when
the load goes up, and the instances will be terminated (or stopped - see
below) automatically if it's idle for more than 30 mins.

By default, instances are terminated when the idle timeout period
expires. You can change this by specifying the Stop/Disconnect on Idle
Timeout flat in the Advanced properties of the AMI configuration. If
this is specified, the instance is stopped when the timeout expires. If
the instance is required again, then the plugin will look for a stopped
instance that exactly corresponds to the AMI specification and resume it
if found. Otherwise a new instance is started. Having the instances be
stopped instead of terminated is useful when you are using EBS volumes
and want to keep them mounted for the life of the instance and reuse the
instance for long periods of time. This can greatly reduce the startup
time of the instance since it does not have to build the volume from the
snapshot.

## Spot Instances

Spot instances are similar to EC2 instances, except for a few key
differences. They are generally more affordable, but they have the
possibility of being terminated if someone has bid more on them than you
have and can take longer to provision.  To mitigate some of these
issues, your Jenkins and Agent AMIs will need a bit of configuration to
convert the Spot agents to register with Jenkins when they spawn up. Due
to these changes, it may appear that a Spot agent will have failed (with
a red X), but the message associated with the error will inform you if
the Spot instance just has not called back yet or not. For more
information on Spot instances, read the information
here: <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/> .

### Enable Spot Request

To enable use of Spot as opposed to EC2 for an instance, the "Use Spot
Instance" check box must be checked.  Also, a bid price must be
specified.  If you want to determine what the current price of the
instance is without going to the AWS website, pick your region and
instance type (as you already should) and click "Check Current Spot
Price".

To choose between a Persistent or One Time bid (to keep the bid alive
until cancelled or to stop the bid after it has been fulfilled once),
choose from the drop down menu.

### Configure Jenkins for Spot Support

For Jenkins, the major configuration change will be if you have a
restrictive firewall, since these instances need to connect back to
Jenkins.  The first configuration change to Jenkins is to change your
Jenkins URL option in the Configure Jenkins page to be the external URL
to the server.  One port that needs to be open is the one that you use
to access Jenkins, the other is the JNLP port, which is generally
randomly assigned.  To set the JNLP port to something predictable,
follow the Connection Mechanism section on this page. [Jenkins
CLI](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BCLI)

### Configure AMI for Spot Support

In order for your EC2 instance to know that it is to be a Jenkins agent,
it must be preconfigured with start up commands so that it can register
itself with Jenkins.  The Jenkins information is passed to the Spot
agents via EC2 user-data.  This information includes the name that
Jenkins has given the agent, and the configured URL for the Jenkins
controller node.

Sample scripts for assisting in configuring an Ubuntu-based AMI to work
with the Jenkins ec2-plugin and Spot agents are included with the
installation of the plugin.

Config Script:

```
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Startup Script:

```
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-init.py
```

The config script is run by the user from the EC2 instance with root
access.  It installs Java onto the instance, fetches the startup
script and sets it to run when the machine starts up.  It can be
retrieved from the above URL using a command like wget, or copied over
using a tool like `scp`.

```
wget (jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Once the scripts have been downloaded, the script can be run. Running
this script will also run the `ubuntu-init.py` script, so there is no
need to run it on its own.

```
sudo sh ubuntu-ami-setup.sh jenkins_server{:port}
```

Note: "http://" will be prefixed to the jenkins\_server parameter

The config script then fetches the startup script and sets up the AMI to
register itself with a Jenkins controller node when it gets started.

After setting up the image, you can save the image using Amazon’s EC2
web console. To do this, right click on your instance from the console
and select “Create Image (EBS AMI)”.

In order to set up additional images using other operating systems, you
can configure your own startup script based on the startup script above.
 This script should perform the following actions when the machine is
started up:

```
# Verify that Java is installed

# Install Java if it is not installed

# Read user data for the EC2 instance. It is available from [http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data]

# Values are passed in with the format of JENKINS_URL=[Jenkins_Url]&SLAVE_NAME=[Agent_Name]&USER_DATA=[other_user_data]

# Parse the values to retrieve the Jenkins_Url and Agent_Name
# Fetch the agent.jar from the Jenkins controller using wget (or something similar)

wget [Jenkins_Url]jnlpJars/agent.jar -O agent.jar
# Register the agent to the Jenkins controller node

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl [Jenkins_Url]computer/ [Agent_Name] slave-agent.jnlp
```

## IAM setup

It's possible to create a separate account for Jenkins using the Amazon
IAM feature. Go to the IAM tab in the AWS console and create a user. Then go
to the user's ***Permissions*** tab and use this policy (change username if
your user is not called ***jenkins***):

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1312295543082",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:CancelSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:GetConsoleOutput",
                "ec2:RequestSpotInstances",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteTags",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
                "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "ec2:GetPasswordData"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you want to launch agents with an IAM Instance Profile, "iam:PassRole"
permission is required.

If you want to launch Windows agents and use the generated Administrator
password, the "ec2:GetPasswordData" permission is also required.

## Programmatically adding/updating CloudTemplates

The plugin supports programmatic addition and update of `CloudTemplates` in an already existing `Cloud` -
both can be accomplished via the Jenkins script console [Jenkins script console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole).

Example:

```
 // Assuming on the Jenkins instance, there exists an EC2Cloud with the name "AwsCloud"

 EC2Cloud cloud = (EC2Cloud) Jenkins.get().clouds.stream().filter(cloud1 -> Objects.equals(cloud.getDisplayName(), "AwsCloud")).findFirst().get();

 SlaveTemplate template = new SlaveTemplate(/*constructor*/); // View available constructors at https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/ec2/SlaveTemplate.java

 // Adding a template
 cloud.addTemplate(template);

 SlaveTemplate template2 = new SlaveTemplate(/*constructor*/);
 // Updating a template. Note the description of an existing SlaveTemplate needs to passed in order for there to be a successful update, otherwise an Exception is thrown
 cloud.updateTemplate(template2, template.description);
```

# Security

## Securing the connection to Unix AMIs

When you set up a template for a *Unix* instance (`Type AMI` field), you can select the strategy used to guarantee the
instance you're connecting to is the expected one. You should use a strong strategy to guarantee that a
*[man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)* cannot be performed.

You can select your strategy under the *Advanced...* configuration, on the *Host Key Verification Strategy* field of
every configured AMI.

The plugin provides several strategies because each one has its own requirements. So providing more than one allows
administrators to use the one best fits to their environment. These strategies are:

### Strategies

#### Check New Hard

This strategy checks the SSH host key provided by the instance with the key printed out in the instance console during
the instance initialization. If the key is not found, the plugin **doesn't allow** the connection to the instance to
guarantee the instance is the right one. If the key is found and it is the same as the one presented by the instance,
then it's saved to be used on future connections, so the console is only checked once.

Requirements:

* The AMI used should print the key used. It's a common behaviour, for example the *Amazon Linux 2* AMI prints it
  out. You can consult the AMI documentation to figure it out.
* The launch timeout should be long enough to allow the plugin to check the instance console. With this strategy, the
  plugin waits for the console to be available, which can take a few minutes. The *Launch Timeout in seconds* field should
  have a number to allow that, for example 600 (10 minutes). By default there is no timeout, so it's safe.

The expected format on the instance console is `algorithm base64-public-key` at the beginning of a line. For example:

```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNFNGfKpPS/UT2jAEa0+9aZneku2a7TVwN+MjGesm65DDGnXPcM9TM9BsiOE+s4Vo6aCT9L/TVrtDFa0hqbnqc8=
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHm0sVqkjSuaPg8e7zfaKXt3b1hE1tBwFsB18NOWv5ow
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDNTngsAxOCpZwt+IBqJSQ9MU2qVNYzP4D5i1OHfIRXCrnAuJ54GtFzZEZqqo4e1e/JqBQOX3ZPsaegbkzl2uq5FzfFcFoYYXg5gL7htlZ1I2k6/2iIBv7CHAjbpXMkH8WoF2C3vZFRMWLs20ikQpED+9m11VejE19+kqJwLMopyAtq+/mCgiv4nw5QWh3rrrEcbgzuxYoMD0t9daqBq1V0lzRqL36ALVySy7oDjr3YzCN+wMXe1I36kv3lSeCHXnhc53ubrBIsRakWLBndHhPqyyAOMEjdby/O/EQ2PR7vBpH5MaseaJwvRRDPQ6qt4sV8lk0tEt9qbdb1prFRB4W1

```

Recommended for:

This strategy is the most secure. It's recommended for every instance if you can meet the requirements. We recommend,
whenever possible, configuring each AMI with *Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout* to take advantage of the ssh host key
cache allowing next connections to be done faster.

#### Check New Soft

This strategy checks the SSH host key provided by the instance with the key printed out in the instance console during
the instance initialization. If the key is not found, the plugin **allows** the connection to the instance in order to
guarantee the instance is the right one. If the key is found and it is the same as the one presented by the instance,
then it's saved to be used on future connections, so the console is only checked once.

Requirements:

* The AMI used may print the key used to guarantee the instance is the right one, but **it's not mandatory**.
* The launch timeout should be long enough to allow the plugin to check the instance console. With this strategy, the
  plugin waits for the console to be available, which can take a few minutes. The *Launch Timeout in seconds* field should
  have a number to allow that. For example 600 (10 minutes). By default there is no timeout, so it's safe. If the timeout
  expires, the connection is not done.

The expected format on the instance console is `algorithm base64-public-key` at the beginning of a line. For example:

```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNFNGfKpPS/UT2jAEa0+9aZneku2a7TVwN+MjGesm65DDGnXPcM9TM9BsiOE+s4Vo6aCT9L/TVrtDFa0hqbnqc8=

```

Recommended for:

This strategy is the default one for AMIs created with a former version of the plugin. It doesn't break any connection
because the plugin connects to the instance even when the key is not found on the console. The only point to take into
account is you need to have the right timeout to allow the plugin to get the instance console. This strategy is recommended
when upgrading from a previous version of the plugin. *Check New Hard* is the safest strategy, so you should
consider migrating to it. We recommend, whenever possible, configuring each AMI with *Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout*
to take advantage of the ssh host key cache allowing next connections to be done faster.

#### Accept New

This strategy doesn't check any key on the console. It accepts the key provided by the instance on the first
connection. Then, the key is saved to be used on future connections to detect a Man-in-the-Middle attack (the host
key has changed).

Requirements:

* N/A

Recommended for:

This strategy is recommended when your AMIs don't print out the host keys on the console. The *Check New Soft* cannot be
used, but at least, you can catch a man-in-the-middle attack on further connections to the same instance. If the attack
was already perpetrated you cannot detect that. Again, the *Check New Hard* is the safest strategy.

#### Off

This strategy neither checks any key on the console, nor checks future connections to the same instance with a saved
key. It accepts blindly the key provided by the instance on the first and further connections.

Requirements:

* N/A

Recommended for:

This strategy is not recommended because of its lack of security. It is the strategy used for prior versions of the plugin.

### New AMIs

The default strategy for every new instance is the *Check New Hard* one. You can select a strategy per AMI. It's under
the *Advanced...* configuration, on the *Host Key Verification Strategy* field.

### Upgrade - Existing AMIs

You may upgrade from a Jenkins installation with a former plugin version without this security mechanism. The default
strategy for every existing instance is the *Check New Soft* strategy. This guarantees your jobs are not going to stop
working and improves the situation. We recommend, if possible, upgrading to the *Check New Hard* strategy to be safer
against a *Man in the Middle attack*.

## Securing the connection to Windows AMIs

When you configure a template for a *Windows* instance (`Type AMI` field), you can use HTTPS and disallow
self-signed certificates. This guarantees the instance you're connecting to is the expected one and a
[man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) cannot be performed.

### AMI Set Up

Before securely connecting to the instance, you need to 1) configure the AMI, 2)install the
certificate, 3) configure WinRM properly and 4) set the firewall rules to allow the connection. You can find some
guidance at the `AMI Type` field help, under the template configuration on your Jenkins instance.

Tips:

* When the `Allow Self Signed Certificate` field is checked, the plugin allows self-signed certificates. It means that
  the plugin neither checks the CA which issued the certificate, nor verifies the host it is connecting to is present on
  the certificate. If the field is not checked, this kind of certificates are not allowed and both verifications are performed.
* The EC2 plugin connects to the instance using either an IP address. It does not use the DNS name. You must configure WinRM with a certificate which includes
  the **IP** of the instance. Something like:

```
#3: ObjectId: 2.5.29.17 Criticality=false
SubjectAlternativeName [
  DNSName: myhostname.com
  IPAddress: 111.222.333.444  <--------------
]

```

# Known Issues

## Authentication Timeout

If you have issues with authentication timing out as a node is starting
(see the stack traces in
[JENKINS-30284](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30284)) you
can use these System Properties to adjust the number of tries and
timeout values:

```
jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthSleepMs (default 30000)
jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthTries (default 30)

```

## Amazon Linux build/connectivity issues

If you are using a Amazon Linux AMI and encounter exceptions like
***java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.201.b09-0.amzn2.x86\_64/jre/lib/currency.data
(No such file or directory)*** or ***Remote call on EC2
[...] failed*** then chances are that the Amazon Linux is doing some
security upgrades in the background and causes the agent to be in an
invalid state.

Another symptom of the same problem if you run Docker on your agents can be
either docker containers randomly exiting with ExitCode 137 or getting error
messages with "EOF" part way through trying to pull or run images - this can occur
if there is a security patch for Docker itself because applying this update stops
Docker. These upgrades are asynchronous on Amazon Linux 2 (whereas on the older
Amazon Linux the docs stated that the SSH service was not started until they complete)
so your Jenkins job may have already started using Docker, causing this issue.

From the
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates)
of the Amazon Linux it's stated:

> Amazon Linux is configured to download and install security updates at
> launch time.[...] The default setting for repo\_upgrade is security.
> That is, if you don't specify a different value in your user data, by
> default, Amazon Linux performs the security upgrades at launch for any
> packages installed at that time

You can check by looking for `repo_upgrade:` in "cloud-init" settings `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg`.

This issue can be solved in different ways:

1. Rebuild your AMI so the latest security fixes are baked in => this will mean
   however that the issue could eventually come back if further patches are published.
2. Update the Jenkins config for launching your AMI, so it disables automatic installation of security fixes
   (see amazon [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates))
   by adding the following in 'User Data' under 'Advanced' for the AMI in Jenkins Clouds config:

   ```
   #cloud-config
   repo_upgrade: none

   ```
3. If you disable repo\_upgrade per the previous point, you can optionally still ensure patches are
   applied by adding your own yum command in the 'Init script' for the AMI in Jenkins Clouds config,
   the advantage being that Jenkins will not start using the agent until this init script has finished

## Downgrade from 1.50.2, 1.49.2, 1.46.3 to a previous version

If you updated to 1.50.2, or 1.49.2 or 1.46.3 and you need to downgrade back to the previous version, be sure to **remove** the
file `JENKINS_HOME/ec2.xml` before doing that. This file is created if you click on the button *Dismiss these messages* of
the monitor that warns you when there are some template with a weak strategy. If you don't do that, Jenkins will start and
will overwrite its config.xml file **losing your cloud configuration**.

At this moment, it seems related with a race-condition between the plugin and the `OldDataMonitor` class of Jenkins Core.
See <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-62231>

# Introduction

Allow Jenkins to start agents on [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) on demand, and kill them as they get unused.

With this plugin, if Jenkins notices that your build cluster is overloaded, it'll start instances using the EC2 API and automatically connect them as Jenkins agents. When the load goes down, excess EC2 instances will be terminated. This set up allows you to maintain a small in-house cluster, then spill the spiky build/test loads into EC2 or another EC2 compatible cloud.

# Usage

First, go to [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and sign up for the service. Once you've installed the plugin, you navigate to the main "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System" page, and scroll down near the bottom to the "Cloud" section. There, you click the "Add a new cloud" button, and select the "Amazon EC2" option. This will display the UI for configuring the EC2 plugin.  Then enter the Access Key and Secret Access Key which act like a username/password (see IAM section).

Because of the way EC2 works, you also need to have an RSA private key that the cloud has the other half for, to permit sshing into the instances that are started. Please use the AWS console or any other tool of your choice to generate the private key to interactively log in to EC2 instances.

Once you have generated the needed private key you must either store it as a Jenkins `SSH Private Key` credential (and select that credential in your cloud config).

If you do not want to create a new Jenkins credential you may alterantively store it in plain text on disk, indicating its file path via the Jenkins system property `hudson.plugins.ec2.EC2Cloud.sshPrivateKeyFilePath`. If this system property has a non-empty value then it will override the ssh credential specified in the cloud configuration page. This approach works well for `k8s` secrets that are mounted in a jenkins container for example.

Once you have put in your Access Key, Secret Access Key, and configured an ssh private key select a region for the cloud (not shown in screenshot). You may define only one cloud for each region, and the regions offered in the UI will show only the regions that you don't already have clouds defined for them.

Use "Test Connection" button to verify that Jenkins can successfully talk to EC2. If you are using UEC you need to click on Advanced and fill out the endpoint details for your cluster.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin@master/docs/images/cloud.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/cloud.png)

Next, configure AMIs that you want to launch. For this, you need to find the AMI IDs for the OS of your choice. [Packer](https://packer.io/) is a good tool for doing that. Jenkins can work with any Unix AMIs. If using an Ubuntu EC2 or UEC AMI you need to fill out the `rootCommandPrefix` and `remoteAdmin` fields under `advanced`. Windows is currently somewhat supported.

Configuring labels allows Jenkins to pick the right AMI to start. For example, if all your existing agents labeled "solaris" are fully busy and you have more builds that are tied to the "solaris" label, Jenkins will start the AMIs that have the "solaris" label.

Init script is the shell script to be run on the newly launched EC2 instance, before Jenkins starts launching a agent agent. If the AMI doesn't have Java pre-installed, you can do this in the init script. This is also a good place to install additional packages that you need for your builds and tests.  The init script is located at **/tmp/init.sh** and is owned and run by the user account specified in the "Remote User" field (so use of "sudo" may be required for non-root accounts).

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin@master/docs/images/ami.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/ami.png)

Configure several AMIs if you need different OS images.

With this setting, your Jenkins will automatically start instances when the load goes up, and the instances will be terminated (or stopped - see below) automatically if it's idle for more than 30 mins.

By default, instances are terminated when the idle timeout period expires. You can change this by specifying the Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout flat in the Advanced properties of the AMI configuration. If this is specified, the instance is stopped when the timeout expires. If the instance is required again, then the plugin will look for a stopped instance that exactly corresponds to the AMI specification and resume it if found. Otherwise a new instance is started. Having the instances be stopped instead of terminated is useful when you are using EBS volumes and want to keep them mounted for the life of the instance and reuse the instance for long periods of time. This can greatly reduce the startup time of the instance since it does not have to build the volume from the snapshot.

## Spot Instances

Spot instances are similar to EC2 instances, except for a few key differences. They are generally more affordable, but they have the possibility of being terminated if someone has bid more on them than you have and can take longer to provision.  To mitigate some of these issues, your Jenkins and Agent AMIs will need a bit of configuration to convert the Spot agents to register with Jenkins when they spawn up. Due to these changes, it may appear that a Spot agent will have failed (with a red X), but the message associated with the error will inform you if the Spot instance just has not called back yet or not. For more information on Spot instances, read the information here: <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/> .

### Enable Spot Request

To enable use of Spot as opposed to EC2 for an instance, the "Use Spot Instance" check box must be checked.  Also, a bid price must be specified.  If you want to determine what the current price of the instance is without going to the AWS website, pick your region and instance type (as you already should) and click "Check Current Spot Price".

To choose between a Persistent or One Time bid (to keep the bid alive until cancelled or to stop the bid after it has been fulfilled once), choose from the drop down menu.

### Configure Jenkins for Spot Support

For Jenkins, the major configuration change will be if you have a restrictive firewall, since these instances need to connect back to Jenkins.  The first configuration change to Jenkins is to change your Jenkins URL option in the Configure Jenkins page to be the external URL to the server.  One port that needs to be open is the one that you use to access Jenkins, the other is the JNLP port, which is generally randomly assigned.  To set the JNLP port to something predictable, follow the Connection Mechanism section on this page. [Jenkins CLI](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BCLI)

### Configure AMI for Spot Support

In order for your EC2 instance to know that it is to be a Jenkins agent, it must be preconfigured with start up commands so that it can register itself with Jenkins.  The Jenkins information is passed to the Spot agents via EC2 user-data.  This information includes the name that Jenkins has given the agent, and the configured URL for the Jenkins controller node.

Sample scripts for assisting in configuring an Ubuntu-based AMI to work with the Jenkins ec2-plugin and Spot agents are included with the installation of the plugin.
 Config Script:

```
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Startup Script:

```
(jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-init.py
```

The config script is run by the user from the EC2 instance with root access.  It installs Java onto the instance, fetches the startup script and sets it to run when the machine starts up.  It can be retrieved from the above URL using a command like wget, or copied over using a tool like `scp`.

```
wget (jenkins_server)/plugin/ec2/AMI-Scripts/ubuntu-ami-setup.sh
```

Once the scripts have been downloaded, the script can be run. Running this script will also run the `ubuntu-init.py` script, so there is no need to run it on its own.

```
sudo sh ubuntu-ami-setup.sh jenkins_server{:port}
```

Note: "http://" will be prefixed to the jenkins\_server parameter

The config script then fetches the startup script and sets up the AMI to register itself with a Jenkins controller node when it gets started.

After setting up the image, you can save the image using Amazon’s EC2 web console. To do this, right click on your instance from the console and select “Create Image (EBS AMI)”.

In order to set up additional images using other operating systems, you can configure your own startup script based on the startup script above.  This script should perform the following actions when the machine is started up:

```
# Verify that Java is installed

# Install Java if it is not installed

# Read user data for the EC2 instance. It is available from [http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data]

# Values are passed in with the format of JENKINS_URL=[Jenkins_Url]&SLAVE_NAME=[Agent_Name]&USER_DATA=[other_user_data]

# Parse the values to retrieve the Jenkins_Url and Agent_Name
# Fetch the agent.jar from the Jenkins controller using wget (or something similar)

wget [Jenkins_Url]jnlpJars/agent.jar -O agent.jar
# Register the agent to the Jenkins controller node

java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl [Jenkins_Url]computer/ [Agent_Name] slave-agent.jnlp
```

## IAM setup

It's possible to create a separate account for Jenkins using the Amazon IAM feature. Go to the IAM tab in the AWS console and create a user. Then go to the user's ***Permissions*** tab and use this policy (change username if your user is not called ***jenkins***):

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1312295543082",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:CancelSpotInstanceRequests",
                "ec2:GetConsoleOutput",
                "ec2:RequestSpotInstances",
                "ec2:RunInstances",
                "ec2:StartInstances",
                "ec2:StopInstances",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "ec2:CreateTags",
                "ec2:DeleteTags",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
                "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeImages",
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
                "ec2:DescribeSubnets",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "ec2:GetPasswordData"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you want to launch agents with an IAM Instance Profile, "iam:PassRole" permission is required.

If you want to launch Windows agents and use the generated Administrator password, the "ec2:GetPasswordData" permission is also required.

## Programmatically adding/updating CloudTemplates

The plugin supports programmatic addition and update of `CloudTemplates` in an already existing `Cloud` - both can be accomplished via the Jenkins script console [Jenkins script console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole).

Example:

```
 // Assuming on the Jenkins instance, there exists an EC2Cloud with the name "AwsCloud"

 EC2Cloud cloud = (EC2Cloud) Jenkins.get().clouds.stream().filter(cloud1 -> Objects.equals(cloud.getDisplayName(), "AwsCloud")).findFirst().get();

 SlaveTemplate template = new SlaveTemplate(/*constructor*/); // View available constructors at https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/ec2/SlaveTemplate.java

 // Adding a template
 cloud.addTemplate(template);

 SlaveTemplate template2 = new SlaveTemplate(/*constructor*/);
 // Updating a template. Note the description of an existing SlaveTemplate needs to passed in order for there to be a successful update, otherwise an Exception is thrown
 cloud.updateTemplate(template2, template.description);
```

# Security

## Securing the connection to Unix AMIs

When you set up a template for a *Unix* instance (`Type AMI` field), you can select the strategy used to guarantee the instance you're connecting to is the expected one. You should use a strong strategy to guarantee that a *[man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)* cannot be performed.

You can select your strategy under the *Advanced...* configuration, on the *Host Key Verification Strategy* field of every configured AMI.

The plugin provides several strategies because each one has its own requirements. So providing more than one allows administrators to use the one best fits to their environment. These strategies are:

### Strategies

#### Check New Hard

This strategy checks the SSH host key provided by the instance with the key printed out in the instance console during the instance initialization. If the key is not found, the plugin **doesn't allow** the connection to the instance to guarantee the instance is the right one. If the key is found and it is the same as the one presented by the instance, then it's saved to be used on future connections, so the console is only checked once.

Requirements:

* The AMI used should print the key used. It's a common behaviour, for example the *Amazon Linux 2* AMI prints it out. You can consult the AMI documentation to figure it out.
* The launch timeout should be long enough to allow the plugin to check the instance console. With this strategy, the plugin waits for the console to be available, which can take a few minutes. The *Launch Timeout in seconds* field should have a number to allow that, for example 600 (10 minutes). By default there is no timeout, so it's safe.

The expected format on the instance console is `algorithm base64-public-key` at the beginning of a line. For example:

```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNFNGfKpPS/UT2jAEa0+9aZneku2a7TVwN+MjGesm65DDGnXPcM9TM9BsiOE+s4Vo6aCT9L/TVrtDFa0hqbnqc8=
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHm0sVqkjSuaPg8e7zfaKXt3b1hE1tBwFsB18NOWv5ow
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDNTngsAxOCpZwt+IBqJSQ9MU2qVNYzP4D5i1OHfIRXCrnAuJ54GtFzZEZqqo4e1e/JqBQOX3ZPsaegbkzl2uq5FzfFcFoYYXg5gL7htlZ1I2k6/2iIBv7CHAjbpXMkH8WoF2C3vZFRMWLs20ikQpED+9m11VejE19+kqJwLMopyAtq+/mCgiv4nw5QWh3rrrEcbgzuxYoMD0t9daqBq1V0lzRqL36ALVySy7oDjr3YzCN+wMXe1I36kv3lSeCHXnhc53ubrBIsRakWLBndHhPqyyAOMEjdby/O/EQ2PR7vBpH5MaseaJwvRRDPQ6qt4sV8lk0tEt9qbdb1prFRB4W1

```

Recommended for:

This strategy is the most secure. It's recommended for every instance if you can meet the requirements. We recommend, whenever possible, configuring each AMI with *Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout* to take advantage of the ssh host key cache allowing next connections to be done faster.

#### Check New Soft

This strategy checks the SSH host key provided by the instance with the key printed out in the instance console during the instance initialization. If the key is not found, the plugin **allows** the connection to the instance in order to guarantee the instance is the right one. If the key is found and it is the same as the one presented by the instance, then it's saved to be used on future connections, so the console is only checked once.

Requirements:

* The AMI used may print the key used to guarantee the instance is the right one, but **it's not mandatory**.
* The launch timeout should be long enough to allow the plugin to check the instance console. With this strategy, the plugin waits for the console to be available, which can take a few minutes. The *Launch Timeout in seconds* field should have a number to allow that. For example 600 (10 minutes). By default there is no timeout, so it's safe. If the timeout expires, the connection is not done.

The expected format on the instance console is `algorithm base64-public-key` at the beginning of a line. For example:

```
ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBNFNGfKpPS/UT2jAEa0+9aZneku2a7TVwN+MjGesm65DDGnXPcM9TM9BsiOE+s4Vo6aCT9L/TVrtDFa0hqbnqc8=

```

Recommended for:

This strategy is the default one for AMIs created with a former version of the plugin. It doesn't break any connection because the plugin connects to the instance even when the key is not found on the console. The only point to take into account is you need to have the right timeout to allow the plugin to get the instance console. This strategy is recommended when upgrading from a previous version of the plugin. *Check New Hard* is the safest strategy, so you should consider migrating to it. We recommend, whenever possible, configuring each AMI with *Stop/Disconnect on Idle Timeout* to take advantage of the ssh host key cache allowing next connections to be done faster.

#### Accept New

This strategy doesn't check any key on the console. It accepts the key provided by the instance on the first connection. Then, the key is saved to be used on future connections to detect a Man-in-the-Middle attack (the host key has changed).

Requirements:

* N/A

Recommended for:

This strategy is recommended when your AMIs don't print out the host keys on the console. The *Check New Soft* cannot be used, but at least, you can catch a man-in-the-middle attack on further connections to the same instance. If the attack was already perpetrated you cannot detect that. Again, the *Check New Hard* is the safest strategy.

#### Off

This strategy neither checks any key on the console, nor checks future connections to the same instance with a saved key. It accepts blindly the key provided by the instance on the first and further connections.

Requirements:

* N/A

Recommended for:

This strategy is not recommended because of its lack of security. It is the strategy used for prior versions of the plugin.

### New AMIs

The default strategy for every new instance is the *Check New Hard* one. You can select a strategy per AMI. It's under the *Advanced...* configuration, on the *Host Key Verification Strategy* field.

### Upgrade - Existing AMIs

You may upgrade from a Jenkins installation with a former plugin version without this security mechanism. The default strategy for every existing instance is the *Check New Soft* strategy. This guarantees your jobs are not going to stop working and improves the situation. We recommend, if possible, upgrading to the *Check New Hard* strategy to be safer against a *Man in the Middle attack*.

## Securing the connection to Windows AMIs

When you configure a template for a *Windows* instance (`Type AMI` field), you can use HTTPS and disallow self-signed certificates. This guarantees the instance you're connecting to is the expected one and a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) cannot be performed.

### AMI Set Up

Before securely connecting to the instance, you need to 1) configure the AMI, 2)install the certificate, 3) configure WinRM properly and 4) set the firewall rules to allow the connection. You can find some guidance at the `AMI Type` field help, under the template configuration on your Jenkins instance.

Tips:

* When the `Allow Self Signed Certificate` field is checked, the plugin allows self-signed certificates. It means that the plugin neither checks the CA which issued the certificate, nor verifies the host it is connecting to is present on the certificate. If the field is not checked, this kind of certificates are not allowed and both verifications are performed.
* The EC2 plugin connects to the instance using either an IP address. It does not use the DNS name. You must configure WinRM with a certificate which includes the **IP** of the instance. Something like:

```
#3: ObjectId: 2.5.29.17 Criticality=false
SubjectAlternativeName [
  DNSName: myhostname.com
  IPAddress: 111.222.333.444  <--------------
]

```

# Known Issues

## Authentication Timeout

If you have issues with authentication timing out as a node is starting (see the stack traces in [JENKINS-30284](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30284)) you can use these System Properties to adjust the number of tries and timeout values:

```
jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthSleepMs (default 30000)
jenkins.ec2.bootstrapAuthTries (default 30)

```

## Amazon Linux build/connectivity issues

If you are using a Amazon Linux AMI and encounter exceptions like ***java.io.FileNotFoundException: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.201.b09-0.amzn2.x86\_64/jre/lib/currency.data (No such file or directory)*** or ***Remote call on EC2 [...] failed*** then chances are that the Amazon Linux is doing some security upgrades in the background and causes the agent to be in an invalid state.

Another symptom of the same problem if you run Docker on your agents can be either docker containers randomly exiting with ExitCode 137 or getting error messages with "EOF" part way through trying to pull or run images - this can occur if there is a security patch for Docker itself because applying this update stops Docker. These upgrades are asynchronous on Amazon Linux 2 (whereas on the older Amazon Linux the docs stated that the SSH service was not started until they complete) so your Jenkins job may have already started using Docker, causing this issue.

From the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates) of the Amazon Linux it's stated:

> Amazon Linux is configured to download and install security updates at launch time.[...] The default setting for repo\_upgrade is security. That is, if you don't specify a different value in your user data, by default, Amazon Linux performs the security upgrades at launch for any packages installed at that time

You can check by looking for `repo_upgrade:` in "cloud-init" settings `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg`.

This issue can be solved in different ways:

1. Rebuild your AMI so the latest security fixes are baked in => this will mean however that the issue could eventually come back if further patches are published.
2. Update the Jenkins config for launching your AMI, so it disables automatic installation of security fixes (see amazon [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#security-updates)) by adding the following in 'User Data' under 'Advanced' for the AMI in Jenkins Clouds config:

   ```
   #cloud-config
   repo_upgrade: none

   ```
3. If you disable repo\_upgrade per the previous point, you can optionally still ensure patches are applied by adding your own yum command in the 'Init script' for the AMI in Jenkins Clouds config, the advantage being that Jenkins will not start using the agent until this init script has finished

## Downgrade from 1.50.2, 1.49.2, 1.46.3 to a previous version

If you updated to 1.50.2, or 1.49.2 or 1.46.3 and you need to downgrade back to the previous version, be sure to **remove** the file `JENKINS_HOME/ec2.xml` before doing that. This file is created if you click on the button *Dismiss these messages* of the monitor that warns you when there are some template with a weak strategy. If you don't do that, Jenkins will start and will overwrite its config.xml file **losing your cloud configuration**.

At this moment, it seems related with a race-condition between the plugin and the `OldDataMonitor` class of Jenkins Core. See <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-62231>

* [Copy Artifact
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact)
* [Credentials Binding

## Descriptions

### Secrets are not masked by Credentials Binding Plugin in builds without build steps

**SECURITY-1374
/
CVE-2020-2181**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets when the build contains no build steps.
Â

### Improper masking of some secrets in Credentials Binding Plugin

**SECURITY-1835
/
CVE-2020-2182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`.
This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`).
This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.

### Improper permission checks in Copy Artifact Plugin

**SECURITY-988
/
CVE-2020-2183**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copyartifact`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact)**

**Description:**

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build.
This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts.
When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained ("Migration mode").
To enable the additional protections, switch to the new "Production mode".
Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts.
For more information see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).

### CSRF vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-1094
/
CVE-2020-2184**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

CVS Plugin 2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing SSH host key validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-381
/
CVE-2020-2185**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 provides strategies for performing host key validation for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
It includes assistance for administrators to migrate to a new, more secure strategy.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-unix-amis).

### CSRF vulnerability in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1408
/
CVE-2020-2186**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows an attacker to provision instances with an attacker-specified template ID.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1528
/
CVE-2020-2187**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation.
A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis).

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1844
/
CVE-2020-2188**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### RCE vulnerability in SCM Filter Jervis Plugin

**SECURITY-1826
/
CVE-2020-2189**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`scm-filter-jervis`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scm-filter-jervis)**

**Description:**

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
