Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Fortify Plugin for Jenkins stored the proxy server password in plain text within the `config.xml` files of jobs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the storage of the proxy server password without any encryption or obfuscation. This makes it easily readable to anyone with access to the `config.xml` files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the `config.xml` files could obtain the proxy server password, which could allow them to potentially gain unauthorized access to systems that the proxy is used to connect to.
- **Potential Lateral Movement:** With the proxy password, the attacker could pivot to other systems, depending on the function of the proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct File Access:** An attacker could gain access to the `config.xml` files by compromising the Jenkins server or by gaining access to the file system where Jenkins stores its job configurations.
- **Access via Jenkins UI:** Users with "Extended Read" permissions in Jenkins could potentially view the unencrypted password through the Jenkins UI or by using the Jenkins API to access the XML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have at least "Extended Read" permissions to Jenkins.
- Access to the Jenkins server's filesystem where the `config.xml` files are stored.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Fortify Plugin versions 19.1.29 and earlier.
- The fix involves encrypting the proxy server password.
- The Fortify Plugin was updated to version 19.2.30 to address this issue.
