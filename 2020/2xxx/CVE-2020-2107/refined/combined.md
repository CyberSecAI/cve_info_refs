## Descriptions

### Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 authentication bypass

**SECURITY-1682
/
CVE-2020-2099**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.213 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier includes support for the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 for communication between controller and agents.
While [this protocol has been deprecated in 2018](/changelog-old/#v2.128) and was recently removed from Jenkins in 2.214, it could still easily be enabled in Jenkins LTS 2.204.1, 2.213, and older.

This protocol incorrectly reuses encryption parameters which allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to determine the connection secret.
This secret can then be used to connect attacker-controlled Jenkins agents to the Jenkins controller.

Jenkins 2.204.2 no longer allows for the use of Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 by default.
The system property `jenkins.slaves.JnlpSlaveAgentProtocol3.ALLOW_UNSAFE` can be set to `true` to allow enabling the Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 in Jenkins 2.204.2, but doing so is strongly discouraged.

Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 was removed completely from Jenkins 2.214 and will not be part of Jenkins LTS after the end of the 2.204.x line.

### Jenkins vulnerable to UDP amplification reflection attack

**SECURITY-1641
/
CVE-2020-2100**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier supports two network discovery services (UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast) by default.

The UDP multicast/broadcast service can be used in an amplification reflection attack, as very few bytes sent to the respective endpoint result in much larger responses:
A single byte request to this service would respond with more than 100 bytes of Jenkins metadata which could be used in a DDoS attack on a Jenkins controller.
Within the same network, spoofed UDP packets could also be sent to make two Jenkins controllers go into an infinite loop of replies to one another, thus causing a denial of service.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now disables both UDP multicast/broadcast and DNS multicast by default.

Administrators that need these features can re-enable them again by setting the system property `hudson.DNSMultiCast.disabled` to `false` (for DNS multicast) or the system property `hudson.udp` to `33848`, or another port (for UDP broadcast/multicast).
These are the same system properties that controlled whether these features were enabled in the past, so any instances explicitly enabling these features by setting these system properties will continue to have them enabled.

### Non-constant time comparison of inbound TCP agent connection secret

**SECURITY-1659
/
CVE-2020-2101**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison validating the connection secret when an inbound TCP agent connection is initiated.
This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain the connection secret.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now uses a constant-time comparison function for verifying connection secrets.

### Non-constant time HMAC comparison

**SECURITY-1660
/
CVE-2020-2102**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two HMACs are equal.
This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid HMAC for an attacker-controlled input value.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now uses a constant-time comparison when validating HMACs.

### Diagnostic page exposed session cookies

**SECURITY-1695
/
CVE-2020-2103**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins shows various technical details about the current user on the `/whoAmI` page.
In [a previous fix](/security/advisory/2019-09-25/#SECURITY-1505), the `Cookie` header value containing the HTTP session ID was redacted.
However, user metadata shown on this page could also include the HTTP session ID in Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier.

This allows attackers able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the HTTP session ID value from this page.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 no longer prints out the affected user metadata that might contain the HTTP session ID.

Additionally, we also redact values of further authentication-related HTTP headers in addition to `Cookie` on this page as a hardening.

### Memory usage graphs accessible to anyone with Overall/Read

**SECURITY-1650
/
CVE-2020-2104**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins includes a feature that shows a JVM memory usage chart for the Jenkins controller.

Access to the chart in Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier requires no permissions beyond the general Overall/Read, allowing users who are not administrators to view JVM memory usage data.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now requires Overall/Administer permissions to view the JVM memory usage chart.

### Jenkins REST APIs vulnerable to clickjacking

**SECURITY-1704
/
CVE-2020-2105**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not serve the `X-Frame-Options: deny` HTTP header on REST API responses to protect against clickjacking attacks.
An attacker could exploit this by routing the victim through a specially crafted web page that embeds a REST API endpoint in an iframe and tricking the user into performing an action which would allow for the attacker to learn the content of that REST API endpoint.

Jenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now adds the `X-Frame-Options: deny` HTTP header to REST API responses, which prevents these types of clickjacking attacks.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Code Coverage Plugin

**SECURITY-1680
/
CVE-2020-2106**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`code-coverage-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api)**

**Description:**

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.2 and earlier does not escape the filename of the coverage report used in its view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users able to change the job configuration.

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.3 escapes the filename of the coverage report used in its view.

### Fortify Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1565
/
CVE-2020-2107**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify)**

**Description:**

Fortify Plugin 19.1.29 and earlier stored its proxy server password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files.
This password could be read by users with the Extended Read permission.

Fortify Plugin 19.2.30 now encrypts the proxy server password.

### XXE vulnerability in WebSphere Deployer Plugin

**SECURITY-1719
/
CVE-2020-2108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`websphere-deployer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/websphere-deployer)**

**Description:**

WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This could be exploited by a user with Job/Configure permissions to upload a specially crafted war file containing a `WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` which is parsed by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1682 / CVE-2020-2099
Jenkins 2.213 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier includes support for the
Inbound TCP Agent Protocol/3 for communication between master and agents.
While this protocol has been deprecated in 2018 and was recently removed
from Jenkins in 2.214, it could still easily be enabled in Jenkins LTS
2.204.1, 2.213, and older.

This protocol incorrectly reuses encryption parameters which allow an

This is the official Jenkins plugin for Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) and Fortify Software Security Center (SSC).

| Plugin Information |
| --- |

The plugin adds the ability to perform security analysis with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, upload results to Fortify Software Security Center, show analysis results summary, and set build failure criteria based on analysis results.

### Summary

Use the Fortify Jenkins Plugin in your continuous integration builds to identify security issues in your source code using Fortify Static Code Analyzer. After the Fortify Static Code Analyzer analysis is complete, you can upload the results to a Fortify Software Security Center server. The Fortify Jenkins Plugin also enables you to view the analysis result details within Jenkins. It provides metrics for each build and an overview of the results, without requiring you to log into Fortify Software Security Center.

### Documentation

You can find official plugin documentation here: <https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/fortify-jenkins-plugin/>

For more information about Fortify Static Code Analyzer, visit <https://www.microfocus.com/cyberres/application-security/static-code-analyzer>.

For more information about Fortify Software Security Center, visit <https://www.microfocus.com/cyberres/application-security/software-security-center>.

### Features

* Provides a post-build action to analyze the source with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, update Security Content, analyze remotely with Fortify ScanCentral SAST, upload analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center, and set the build status to unstable depending on uploaded results processed by Fortify Software Security Center
* Provides pipeline support for source code analysis locally with Fortify Static Code Analyzer and remotely with Fortify ScanCentral SAST, updating Security Content, and uploading analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center
* Displays analysis results for each Job analyzed locally with Fortify Static Code Analyzer, which includes a history trend and the latest issues from Fortify Software Security Center, and navigation to individual issues on Fortify Software Security Center for detailed analysis

### Video tutorial

This set of instructions describes how to configure the plugin to run a local Fortify Static Code Analyzer scan, upload the analysis results to Software Security Center, and then see the analysis results in Jenkins. You can also run the analysis with ScanCentral SAST. See the full documentation for instructions.

1. Create an authentication token of type CIToken. Log in to Fortify Software Security Center, click the **Administration** tab and select **Users > Token Management** on the left pane. Click **New** to create an authentication token of type CIToken, and then click **Save**. Copy the decoded token at the bottom of the dialog box.
2. In Jenkins, install the Fortify plugin.
3. From the Jenkins menu, select **Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System**. To trigger an unstable build based on the results and to see analysis results in Jenkins, you need to upload the locally run analysis results to Fortify Software Security Center. Scroll down to the **Fortify Assessment** section, and then do the following:

   * In the **SSC URL** box, type the Fortify Software Security Center server URL.
   * Below the **Authentication token** box, click **Add > Jenkins** to open the Jenkins Credentials Provider dialog box and add a credential of the type **Fortify Connection Token**. Add a description for the credential, and paste the token value you created in step 1 in the **Token** box.
   * To use the proxy settings configured in Jenkins for connecting to Fortify Software Security Center, select **Use Jenkins proxy**.
   * Click **Test SSC connection**.
4. To analyze your project with Fortify Static Code Analyzer or to update Fortify security content as part of your build, make sure that the Fortify Static Code Analyzer is in the system Path environment variable or create a Jenkins environment variable to specify the location of the Fortify Static Code Analyzer executable. In **Global properties**, create the following environment variable:

   * **Name:** FORTIFY\_HOME
   * **Value:** *<sca\_install\_dir>* where *<sca\_install\_dir>* is the path where Fortify Static Code Analyzer is installed. For example, on Windows the default installation location is C:\Program Files\Fortify\Fortify\_SCA\_and\_Apps\_*<version>*.

### Configuration when running Jenkins from Docker

When running Jenkins in a Docker container, mount *<sca\_install\_dir>* directory to the Docker container to make Fortify Static Code Analyzer executables accessible from Docker. The following command is an example of how to do this:

```
docker container run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /home/admin/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0:/var/jenkins_home/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0 \
  --name=jenkins \
  jenkins/jenkins -d

```

For this example, the value of FORTIFY\_HOME is `/var/Jenkins_home/Fortify/Fortify_SCA_and_Apps_22.1.0`.
