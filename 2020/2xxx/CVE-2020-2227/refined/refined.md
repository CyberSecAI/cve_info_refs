Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Deployer Framework Plugin does not properly sanitize the URL displayed on the build home page. Specifically, it fails to escape the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the user's browser: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, potentially leading to actions performed by the victim user (e.g., session hijacking, data theft, modifying the UI, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker can inject a malicious URL that, when displayed on the build home page, executes arbitrary JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the location (URL) that is displayed. This can be achieved by having the necessary privileges in the plugin.
- User interaction: The user needs to view the build home page where the crafted URL is displayed for the XSS to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Jenkins security team mentioned that the exploitability depends on the specific implementation using Deployer Framework Plugin and that they are not aware of any exploitable implementation. Despite this uncertainty, the vulnerability is still present and can be exploited if a suitable implementation is identified.
- The vulnerability is present in versions 1.2 and earlier of the Deployer Framework Plugin. Version 1.3 addresses this vulnerability by escaping the URL.
