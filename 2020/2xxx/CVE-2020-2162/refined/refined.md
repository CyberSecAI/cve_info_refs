Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Jenkins served files uploaded as file parameters to a build without setting appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of `Content-Security-Policy` headers allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts when a user accesses the uploaded file parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to upload a malicious file via a file parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires permissions to build a job that uses file parameters.
- The attacker must have the ability to upload a malicious file as a build parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Jenkins versions 2.227 and earlier, as well as LTS versions 2.204.5 and earlier.
- Jenkins now sets `Content-Security-Policy` headers when serving files uploaded via a file parameter to mitigate this.
- The system property `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP` can be used to override the default value of the Content-Security-Policy header.
- This vulnerability is distinct from issues related to the Resource Root URL, which does not apply to file parameters.
