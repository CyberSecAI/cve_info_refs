Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2165:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Artifactory Plugin transmitted Artifactory server passwords in plain text as part of the configuration form, even though the password was stored encrypted on disk. This occurred because the plugin did not encrypt the password during transmission within the configuration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure transmission of sensitive data.
- Exposure of credentials through plain text transmission.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of Artifactory server password.
- Potential for unauthorized access to the Artifactory server if the password is intercepted.
- This could be achieved by malicious browser extensions, or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the Jenkins environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- Interception of network traffic while the password is transmitted in plain text during the configuration form submission.
- Exploitation of other vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) that could leak the password.
- Malicious browser extensions that have access to the configuration form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic or have access to the browser's network requests where the password is being transmitted
- Ability to exploit XSS or have a malicious browser extension installed.
- No specific user permissions on the Jenkins instance are required to exploit the transmission of the password, but they would need some access to the network traffic or browser as mentioned above.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability existed in Artifactory Plugin versions 3.6.0 and earlier.
- The fix was implemented in Artifactory Plugin 3.6.1, which now transmits the password encrypted.
- While the password was stored encrypted since Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0, the transmission in plain text made this encryption ineffective.
- This vulnerability is related to, but separate from, CVE-2020-2164, which describes the plain text storage of the password on the filesystem before version 3.6.0 of the plugin.
