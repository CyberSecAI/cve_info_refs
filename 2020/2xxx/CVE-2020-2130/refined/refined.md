Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2130:

**CVE-2020-2130** relates to the **Harvest SCM Plugin** for Jenkins.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Harvest SCM Plugin stores SCM passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file (`hudson.plugins.harvest.HarvestSCM.xml`) and also in job-specific `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data**: Storing passwords without any encryption makes them easily accessible to unauthorized users.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Credential Exposure**: Attackers can gain access to the stored SCM passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to source code repositories or other systems protected by these credentials.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **File System Access**: An attacker who can access the Jenkins master's file system can read the global configuration file and job `config.xml` files to retrieve the passwords.
    *   **Extended Read Permission**: Users with "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins jobs can view the job configuration files containing the unencrypted passwords.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Access to Jenkins Master File System**: Attackers need some method to browse the Jenkins master's file system.
    *   **Extended Read Permissions**: Users with this permission can access the vulnerable job configuration files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is identified by the internal Jenkins security issue ID: **SECURITY-1553**
*   The related **CVE-2020-2131** covers the same issue but specifically the passwords stored within the job `config.xml` files
