- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the GlobalProtect SSL VPN component of PAN-OS software, specifically in how it handles client certificate verification. It allows an attacker to bypass all client certificate checks with an invalid certificate.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass due to improper client certificate verification.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can successfully authenticate as any user and gain access to restricted VPN network resources. This impacts the confidentiality and integrity of the VPN resources.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is over the network (remote).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote and can use a network connection to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to present an invalid certificate during the authentication process. No prior user interaction is required.
