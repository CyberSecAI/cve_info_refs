Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2215 and CVE-2020-2216:

**CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2216 (Missing Permission Check)**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin, versions 1.5 and earlier.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin has a form validation method that lacks both a permission check and protection against CSRF attacks.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action. Specifically, users with `Overall/Read` access can trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
    *   Connect to an attacker-specified host (JIRA server) using attacker-specified username and password.
    *  Potentially gain unauthorized access to the JIRA server and the ability to manipulate the JIRA instance.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could craft a malicious link or web page that, when accessed by an authenticated user with `Overall/Read` access, triggers the form validation method with attacker-controlled parameters.
    *   This can be done without the user's knowledge, enabling the attacker to specify the host, username and password used to connect with a JIRA server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user with `Overall/Read` access into visiting the malicious link or web page.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the Jenkins instance URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content states that "As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix." for this vulnerability.
*   The Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin documentation highlights the configuration of the JIRA server within the Jenkins global settings. This is the area where these vulnerabilities are present.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.
