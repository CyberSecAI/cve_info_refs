## **About the Plugin**

Zephyr for JIRA Plugin for Jenkins integrates Jenkins and Zephyr for
JIRA – Test Management for JIRA Cloud and JIRA Server / Data Center
deployments. This plugin creates test cases and publishes test results
in JIRA for JUnit test cases in Jenkins. It supports publishing maven
surefire format test results (JUnit and TestNG).

This guide will cover how to create and execute test cases automatically
in Zephyr for JIRA – Test Management using this plugin; this includes

1. Downloading and installing the plugin.
2. Adding JIRA Severs in the Jenkins global settings.
3. Configuring a standard Jenkins Job.
4. Configuring Zephyr for JIRA Plugin job as a post build action.
5. Triggering the job and publishing results in JIRA.

# **Configuring a standard Jenkins job**

A job in Jenkins defines a sequence of tasks for Jenkins to perform.
When a job is triggered, Jenkins looks for an Ant script or Maven build
file and runs it. It also provides options to define post-build tasks.
Follow the example below to configure a standard job and add a post
build action:

1. Create a new Jenkins job by clicking the "New Item" link found on
   the menu.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/zephyr-for-jira-test-management/docs/images/worddavab4067eb8b3b9cb4c3baa72c5f99c599.png){width="247"

height="145"}

# **Configuring Zephyr for JIRA Test Management plugin as a post build action**

In order to publish results in Zephyr for JIRA, define another
post-build action.

1. Select "Publish test result to Zephyr for JIRA" from "Add post-build
   Actions" dropdown.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/zephyr-for-jira-test-management/docs/images/worddav3dc756e75385fea66c0d7fc5d5ddda0c.png){width="532"
height="196"}

2. Configure Zephyr plugin job.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/zephyr-for-jira-test-management/docs/images/worddav6eba25a825009981b38f3b63c7c16071.png){width="615"
height="260"}

1. 1. 1. Select the JIRA URL from the dropdown. (Servers configured
         in the Jenkins global configuration are available here to
         select). This automatically pulls in projects, versions and
         cycles.
      2. Select the Project Name from the dropdown. This re-populates
         the versions.
      3. Select the Version from the dropdown. Selecting a version
         fetches all its cycles.
      4. Select either an existing Cycle from the dropdown or create
         a new cycle.
      5. For existing Cycle the default Cycle Duration will be that
         of existing cycle in Zephyr and Cycle Name Prefix will be of
         the format "Automation\_<Date><Time>" stamp.
      6. For new cycle you have option to select Cycle Duration from
         the dropdown and to edit default cycle prefix name
         "Automation". In the absence of a cycle prefix name
         "Automation" is used for new cycles.
      7. Click "Save".

# **Triggering the job and publishing results in Zephyr**

To trigger a job manually, click "Build Now" link on the menu. This
builds the project and publishes the Junit result.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/zephyr-for-jira-test-management/docs/images/worddave395d65c90684a521703e040243943df.png){width="161"
height="178"}

Jenkins creates the test cases in the selected JIRA Project.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/zephyr-for-jira-test-management/docs/images/worddav7dda2d708396a1a3e0852313f1b4df41.png){width="624"
height="259"}

Finally, Jenkins assigns these test cases to the selected cycle and
executes all the tests.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1775 / CVE-2020-2201
Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file
path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1690 / CVE-2020-2202
Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to
allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on
Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read
permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as
part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1691 / CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)
Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured
Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1728 (1) / CVE-2020-2205
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration
forms.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

SECURITY-1728 (2) / CVE-2020-2206
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in
the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1776 / CVE-2020-2207
VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1627 / CVE-2020-2208
Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1686 / CVE-2020-2209
TestComplete support Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted
in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This password can
be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master
file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1656 / CVE-2020-2210
Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global
configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
0.3.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Sonargraph Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1775
/
CVE-2020-2201**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sonargraph-integration`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonargraph-integration)**

**Description:**

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin

**SECURITY-1690
/
CVE-2020-2202**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Fortify on Demand Plugin

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by ZAP Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1811
/
CVE-2020-2214**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zap-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zap-pipeline)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) configured are largely unaffected.
A possible exception are file parameter downloads.
The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:

* Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.
* Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.
* Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, don’t have XSS protection for file parameter values, see [SECURITY-1793](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin

**SECURITY-1762
/
CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zephyr-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zephyr-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
