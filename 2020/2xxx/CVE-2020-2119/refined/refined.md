Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2119:

**CVE-2020-2119**

*   **Root Cause:** The Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration, and while the credential is encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Plain Text Transmission:** The client secret is sent in plain text during the configuration form submission.
    *   **Exposure Risk:** The transmission of the secret in plain text makes it vulnerable to interception.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of the client secret can lead to unauthorized access and control of resources associated with the Azure AD application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept the plain text secret transmitted over the network.
    *   **Browser Extensions:** Malicious browser extensions could access the plain text secret within the browser.
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** If other vulnerabilities exist that allow XSS attacks, those could be leveraged to steal the credentials while they are in plain text.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic during the configuration process.
    *   **Browser Access:** If exploiting via a malicious browser extension, the attacker needs to convince a user to install such extension.
    *   **XSS exploitability**: The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute Javascript in the context of the browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin versions 1.1.2 and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in version 1.2.0 of the plugin, which encrypts the client secret during transmission.
