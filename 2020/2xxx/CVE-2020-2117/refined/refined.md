Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2117:

**CVE-2020-2117: Missing permission check in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin (versions 1.0.4 and earlier) does not perform permission checks on a method that implements form validation. This allows unauthorized users to access a functionality intended for administrative purposes.

*   **Weakness:** The plugin lacks proper access control, allowing users with `Overall/Read` permissions to call the form validation method, which should require a higher privilege level.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers can connect to an attacker-specified URL by using attacker-specified credential IDs.
    *   This can lead to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

*  **Attack Vector:** A user with Overall/Read access can trigger the vulnerable method to connect to an arbitrary URL by using arbitrary credentials IDs.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker also needs to obtain valid credential IDs through another vulnerability (CVE-2020-2118).

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a set of issues identified as `SECURITY-812 (1)`, which includes both CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF) and CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check).
*   The fix for this issue is included in version 1.0.5 of the Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin.
*   The form validation method should require POST requests and Item/Configure permission, which is implemented in the fixed version.
