SECURITY-1710 / CVE-2020-2109
Sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.78 and earlier can be
circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed
methods.

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1713 / CVE-2020-2110
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.69 and earlier can be
circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST
transforming annotations such as `@...b` to imports or by using them inside
of other annotations. This affects both script execution (typically invoked
from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing
sandboxed script validation.

Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox
protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

This issue is due to an incomplete fix of SECURITY-1266.

SECURITY-1725 / CVE-2020-2111
Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for
the Project Repository Base URL field form validation. This results in a
stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to
specify such base URLs, for example users able to configure Multibranch
Pipelines.

SECURITY-1709 / CVE-2020-2112 (parameter name) & CVE-2020-2113 (default value)
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.11 and earlier does not correctly escape the
parameter name or default value. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1684 / CVE-2020-2114
S3 publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4
and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1752 / CVE-2020-2115
NUnit Plugin 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-812 (1) / CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check)
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform
permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-812 (2) / CVE-2020-2118
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of
applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select
the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1717 / CVE-2020-2119
Azure AD Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Azure AD Plugin 1.1.2 and
earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1751 / CVE-2020-2120
FitNesse Plugin 1.30 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-1731 / CVE-2020-2121
Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin 0.8.0 and earlier does not configure its
YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results
in a remote code execution vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1644 / CVE-2020-2122
Brakeman Plugin 0.12 and earlier did not escape values received from parsed
JSON files when rendering them, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited by users able to control the Brakeman
post-build step input data.

SECURITY-1733 / CVE-2020-2123
