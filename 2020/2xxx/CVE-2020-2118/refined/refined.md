Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2118:

**CVE-2020-2118**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of applicable credential IDs without proper permission checks.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not implement adequate permission checks when listing available credential IDs.
*   **Weaknesses:** Missing authorization check, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can enumerate valid credential IDs. These IDs could then be used in other attacks to capture the actual credentials using another vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2020-2116/2117).
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to a Jenkins instance.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance. They do not need to be able to configure jobs, but require access to the UI.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin allows any user with Overall/Read permissions to obtain a list of credential IDs without requiring the permissions to configure jobs. This information can then be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities in order to capture the credentials themselves. This vulnerability has a medium severity because although the attacker cannot directly obtain credentials, the credential IDs can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate the attack.
