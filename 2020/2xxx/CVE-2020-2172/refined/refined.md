Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2172:

**CVE-2020-2172**

*   **Root Cause:** The Code Coverage API Plugin, in versions 1.1.4 and earlier, does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **XXE vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller (master).
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can force the Jenkins server to make requests to internal or external services via crafted XML files.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to control the input files that are processed by the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control the XML input files that are used in the Code Coverage Plugin's "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step. This likely requires some level of access to the Jenkins project configuration or the build environment.
    *   A user with the ability to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Code Coverage API Plugin version 1.1.5, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
*   The provided text also mentions other vulnerabilities in different plugins (Gatling, AWSEB Deployment, FitNesse, and useMango Runner), but these are associated with different CVE IDs.
*   This information provides more detail than the CVE description placeholder.
