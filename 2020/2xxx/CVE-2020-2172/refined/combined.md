## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Code Coverage Plugin

**SECURITY-1699
/
CVE-2020-2172**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`code-coverage-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api)**

**Description:**

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This allows a user able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.5 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### XSS vulnerability in Gatling Plugin

**SECURITY-1633
/
CVE-2020-2173**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gatling`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gatling)**

**Description:**

Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3.
This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

Gatling Plugin 1.3.0 no longer allows viewing Gatling reports directly in Jenkins.
Instead users need to download an archive containing the report.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in AWSEB Deployment Plugin

**SECURITY-1769
/
CVE-2020-2174**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`awseb-deployment-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/awseb-deployment-plugin)**

**Description:**

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values printed as part of form validation output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.20 escapes the values printed as part of the affected form validation endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in FitNesse Plugin

**SECURITY-1801
/
CVE-2020-2175**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fitnesse`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fitnesse)**

**Description:**

FitNesse Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the plugin.

FitNesse Plugin 1.33 escapes content from XML input files before rendering it on the Jenkins UI.

### XSS vulnerability in useMango Runner Plugin

**SECURITY-1780
/
CVE-2020-2176**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`usemango-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/usemango-runner)**

**Description:**

Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

useMango Runner Plugin 1.5 escapes all values received from the useMango service in form validation messages.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1633:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

This plugin integrates [Gatling](http://gatling.io/), an Open Source
stress tool, with Jenkins.

## Features

This plugin allows you to :

* Keep track of a Gatling simulation, providing performance trends
  across builds
* Publish detailed reports for each build

## Changelog

![(warning)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/gatling/docs/images/warning.svg)
 \*\*If you're coming from 1.0.0, make sure "Enable simulation tracking"

* 1.0.1 :
  + Ouput directory prefix doesn't need to be specified anymore
  + Better logging in case of trouble finding a report
* 1.0.0 :
  + Initial release

## Configuration

1. Install Gatling Plugin (via Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins)
2. Configure your project to execute Gatling simulations, for example
   using the Maven plugin (see [Maven plugin
   demo](https://github.com/gatling/gatling-maven-plugin-demo))
3. Configure your job :
   1. For a maven job: add "Track a Gatling load simulation" as a new
      post-build action. Beware that neither your Jenkin's path nor
      your job's name should contain any space.
   2. For a pipeline job: add a line to your pipeline script:
      *gatlingArchive()*

**Optional configuration**: You can publish Gatling results with the
Jenkins JUnit plugin. Your Gatling simulation needs to have some
assertions, as each Junit testcase is a different Gatling assertion.

1. Configure the Jenkins plugin with the following Test report XMLs:
   *target/gatling/assertions-\*.xml*
2. Execute Gatling with the following option:
   *-Dgatling.useOldJenkinsJUnitSupport=true*, for example: *mvn
   gatling:execute -Dgatling.useOldJenkinsJUnitSupport=true*

Gatling Plugin will look for files under your Job Root Directory
(defaults to *`$JENKINS_HOME/yourjobname)`*, so you may need to copy the
results file if you're doing a containerized job.

## Gatling plugin usage

As soon as you've properly configured your job and launched a build,
you'll see two changes on your project dashboard :

* A new entry will be available in the left summary : Gatling.
* A graph, displaying the mean response time trend of your last 15
  builds, will appear.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/gatling/docs/images/dashboard.png)

The Gatling entry in the left summary has two purposes, depending on
which page you are.

If you are on the project dashboard, clicking on Gatling will get you to
a more detailed performance trend, displaying for your last 30 builds :

* Mean response time trend
* 95th percentiles response time trend
* Percentage of KO requests

This page will also provides links to detailed reports for all your
builds, at the bottom of the page.

If you are on the summary of a specific build, clicking on Gatling will
get you to a list of all available reports for this build.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
