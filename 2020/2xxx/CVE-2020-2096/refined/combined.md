SECURITY-1004 / CVE-2020-2090 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2091 (missing permission check)
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.47 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS
region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
method.

NOTE: This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials
stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1698 / CVE-2020-2092
Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.0 and earlier does not configure the XML parser
to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot
Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses
external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master,
server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-1708 / CVE-2020-2093 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2094 (missing permission check)
Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users
with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an
attacker-specified recipient.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1696 / CVE-2020-2095
Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API
key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or
access to the master file system.

This is due to an incomplete fix of
link:/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598[SECURITY-1598].

SECURITY-1683 / CVE-2020-2096
Gitlab Hook Plugin 1.4.2 and earlier does not escape project names in the
`build_now` endpoint. This results in a reflected cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-814 / CVE-2020-2097 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2098 (CSRF)
Sounds Plugin 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs
performing form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read access
to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1004
/
CVE-2020-2090 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2091 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.47 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

|  | This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible. |
| --- | --- |

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.48 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### XXE vulnerability in Robot Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1698
/
CVE-2020-2092**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`robot`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/robot)**

**Description:**

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.0 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin

**SECURITY-1708
/
CVE-2020-2093 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2094 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-jenkins-advisor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)**

**Description:**

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1696
/
CVE-2020-2095**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`redgate-sql-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/redgate-sql-ci)**

**Description:**

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

This is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1598](/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598).

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in gitlab-hook Plugin

**SECURITY-1683
/
CVE-2020-2096**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-hook`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-hook)**

**Description:**

gitlab-hook Plugin 1.4.2 and earlier does not escape project names in the `build_now` endpoint.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Sounds Plugin allow OS command execution

**SECURITY-814
/
CVE-2020-2097 (permission check), CVE-2020-2098 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`sounds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sounds)**

**Description:**

Sounds Plugin 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs performing form validation.
This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
