Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2235:

**CVE-2020-2235:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin does not require POST requests for form validation, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. Additionally, there's a missing permission check in the method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **CSRF**: The form validation method in the Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin does not require a POST request, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
    *   **Missing Permission Check**: The form validation method lacks proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to access and manipulate the functionality.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can connect to an attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs.
    *   This allows for potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The attacker can exploit the missing permission check to access the vulnerable form validation method.
    *   CSRF attacks can be performed through various methods such as embedding malicious requests in a website or email.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of credentials IDs, which could be obtained by exploiting CVE-2020-2233.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin versions 3.8.2 and earlier.
*   The fix is implemented in version 3.8.3, which requires POST requests and Job/Configure permission for the affected form validation method.
*   This vulnerability is associated with SECURITY-1794 (2), which is also linked to CVE-2020-2234 (permission check).

This analysis provides more details than the official CVE description, explaining the combined issues of missing permission checks and CSRF vulnerabilities leading to potential credential capturing.
