Use CLH branch stable/v0.5.x, and also re-generate the openAPI client

code with the new 'cloud-hypervisor.yaml'.

Besides the kernel cmdline typo, I'd appreciate if this could be done in 2 separate commits: One for the client package update, and another one for the ro fixes.

[@sboeuf](https://github.com/sboeuf) I believe the `default to true` comes from the `cloud-hypervsior.yaml` [here](https://github.com/sameo/cloud-hypervisor-1/blob/76dc26b0d1715b254680cd715273ab682ef437ed/vmm/src/api/openapi/cloud-hypervisor.yaml#L279). Note that all the code under `client/` here are auto-generated based on the yaml file.
