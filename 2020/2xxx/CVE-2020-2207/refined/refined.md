Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The VncViewer Plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input within the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint. Specifically, it fails to escape a parameter value within the output of this endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of output sanitization leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter. When a user interacts with the crafted link, the malicious code executes within their browser session in the context of the Jenkins domain.
- This can lead to a range of impacts, including session hijacking, stealing of sensitive data (including cookies or other data), and potentially further compromising the Jenkins instance or user's system by injecting further exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the malicious payload as a parameter value, and tricking a user into accessing this malicious URL.
- This URL can be distributed via phishing attacks, compromised web pages, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior access to the Jenkins system, however, they need to be able to entice a user to click on a crafted link.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter in the `checkVncServ` endpoint of the VncViewer plugin.
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL containing the attack payload as a parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects VncViewer Plugin versions 1.7 and earlier.
- VncViewer Plugin version 1.8 includes a fix, which involves escaping the parameter value in the output of `checkVncServ` endpoint
