- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A command injection vulnerability exists in QTS and QuTS hero.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands within a compromised application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting a vulnerability within the QTS and QuTS hero operating systems.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to exploit the command injection vulnerability, which implies they have some level of access to the system or a vulnerable service.
