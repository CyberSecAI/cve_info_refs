Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2200:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Play Framework Plugin allows users to specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins controller. The plugin then executes this `play` command to validate a given input file through a form validation endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: By controlling the path to the `play` command, an attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full control over the Jenkins controller, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This could lead to data breaches, malware installation, and complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a form validation endpoint in the Play Framework Plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to store a file on the Jenkins controller (e.g., through archiving artifacts) and specify the path to that file. They also need to be able to configure the path to the `play` command in the plugin settings.
- They must have at least the Job/Configure permission in order to set up the configuration parameters.
