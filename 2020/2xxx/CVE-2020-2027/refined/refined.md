Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2027:

**Root Cause:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `authd` component of the PAN-OS management server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability is specifically identified as a stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, potentially overwriting other data or control flow information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **System disruption:** Exploitation can disrupt system processes.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** It may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges, which gives the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact on all three of these security aspects.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The complexity of an attack is considered low.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of PAN-OS 7.1 and 8.0
*   PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13
*   PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.7

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.13, 9.0.7, 9.1.0 or later versions.
*   Secure the PAN-OS management interface by following the best practices documentation.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Nicholas Newsom of Palo Alto Networks.
*   PAN-OS 8.0 and 7.1 are either end-of-life or on extended support, respectively. This implies that not all versions will receive the necessary patch.
