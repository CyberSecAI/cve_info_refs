Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2142:

**CVE-2020-2142: Missing permission check in P4 Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The P4 Plugin does not perform permission checks on several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing permission checks on HTTP endpoints and absence of POST request requirement.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Users with Overall/Read access can trigger builds or add labels in the Perforce repository. Additionally, the lack of POST request requirement leads to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation occurs through HTTP endpoints that lack permission checks and do not require POST requests.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:  An attacker only needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**

The P4 Plugin versions 1.10.10 and earlier are vulnerable to missing permission checks on several HTTP endpoints which allow users with Overall/Read access to perform actions that should require higher permissions. The absence of a requirement for POST requests on these endpoints also makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
