{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-2134",
  "baseDescription": "Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be circumvented through crafted constructor calls and bodies and crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`. This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Incomplete fix for SECURITY-582 regarding super-constructor calls and crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient sandbox protection for script execution",
        "Improper handling of Groovy constructors",
		"Improper handling of GroovyInterceptable objects"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the Jenkins master JVM",
      "attackVectors": "Crafted constructor calls and bodies and crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable` within sandboxed scripts.",
      "attackerCapabilities": "Ability to specify and run sandboxed scripts within Jenkins."
