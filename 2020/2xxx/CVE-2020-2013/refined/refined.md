Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cleartext transmission of the PAN-OS session cookie when an administrator performs a context switch from Panorama to a managed firewall.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** The PAN-OS session cookie, which authenticates an administrator, is transmitted over a network in cleartext. This lack of encryption allows an attacker to intercept and steal the cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who intercepts the session cookie can gain access to the administrator's account.
- **Manipulation of Managed Devices:** With administrative access, the attacker can manipulate devices managed by the Panorama server. This could include modifying configurations, disrupting network operations, or performing other malicious activities.
- **High Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact:**  As indicated by the CVSS score, exploitation can lead to a high impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is the network traffic between the PAN-OS Panorama server and the managed firewall.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the PAN-OS Panorama server and the managed firewall. This could involve network sniffing or other man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have prior authentication to the system, but needs to intercept the traffic of an authenticated administrator.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires a user (administrator) to initiate a context switch to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects multiple versions of PAN-OS, including 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 9.0, and 9.1.
- **Mitigations:** Shortening administrator session idle timeouts is suggested as a mitigation. Also, securing the PAN-OS management interface is strongly recommended.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is resolved in PAN-OS versions 7.1.26, 8.1.13, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1 and later.
