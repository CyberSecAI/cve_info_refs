Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2113:

**CVE-2020-2113**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Git Parameter Plugin does not properly escape the default value of the parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they view the job configuration page.
*  **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have Job/Configure permission to configure a job with a malicious default value for a git parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure job parameters in Jenkins.

**Summary**
The Git Parameter Plugin versions 0.9.11 and earlier have a stored XSS vulnerability due to a lack of proper escaping of the parameter's default value. Users with the permission to configure jobs can inject malicious scripts into the parameter default value, which can be executed when other users view the job's configuration page. The fix for this is in version 0.9.12 which properly escapes the default value.
