The provided content relates to CVE-2020-2158.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Literate Plugin does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to the insecure YAML parser configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller (master) by providing specially crafted YAML input files to the Literate Plugin’s build step.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to be able to provide YAML input files to the Literate plugin's build step.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have the ability to specify the YAML input files used by the Literate Plugin’s build step, which typically requires Job/Configure permissions.
