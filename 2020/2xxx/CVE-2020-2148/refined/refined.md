Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2148:

**CVE-2020-2148:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mac Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can connect to an attacker-specified SSH host using attacker-specified credential IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins server.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs Overall/Read access to Jenkins. They also need to obtain valid credentials IDs using another method to specify in the crafted request.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The Mac Plugin 1.1.0 and earlier has a vulnerability where a form validation method lacks permission checks. This allows a user with `Overall/Read` access to potentially connect to an attacker controlled SSH host with specified credentials. Furthermore, this form validation method does not require POST requests which leads to a CSRF vulnerability.
