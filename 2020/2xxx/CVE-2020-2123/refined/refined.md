Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2123:

**CVE Description:**

The RadarGun Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure RadarGun Plugin's build step.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insecure configuration of the YAML parser used by the RadarGun plugin. Specifically, it does not restrict the types of objects that can be instantiated during YAML parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure YAML parsing:** The plugin uses a YAML parser without proper restrictions on object instantiation, allowing for arbitrary object creation during the parsing process. This is a type of insecure deserialization vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on the Jenkins controller by crafting a malicious YAML file that, when parsed, causes the instantiation of arbitrary Java objects, leading to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious YAML Configuration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious YAML configuration to the RadarGun plugin's build step. This YAML data can be supplied either directly within the job configuration, or via an included file using the `!include` directive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Jenkins user with Job/Configure permission:** An attacker needs to have the ability to configure jobs within Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability. This includes the ability to define the YAML configuration for the RadarGun plugin build step.
