Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2243:

**CVE-2020-2243**

*   **Root Cause:** The Cadence vManager Plugin does not properly sanitize build descriptions before displaying them in tooltips.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/encoding.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a build description. When a user hovers over the tooltip displaying this description, the malicious script will execute in their browser within the context of the Jenkins application.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious script into the build description. The tooltip renders this unsanitized description, executing the injected script when a user interacts with the tooltip.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs the "Run/Update" permission for a Jenkins project to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The Cadence vManager Plugin version 3.0.4 and earlier is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. By manipulating build descriptions to include malicious JavaScript code, an attacker with Run/Update permissions can inject code that will be executed when a user views the build description tooltip.
