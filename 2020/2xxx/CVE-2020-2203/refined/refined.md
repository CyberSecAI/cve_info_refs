Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2203:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-2203

**Description:**

CVE-2020-2203 is associated with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Fortify on Demand Plugin for Jenkins. This vulnerability, along with CVE-2020-2204 (a missing permission check), allows unauthorized users to connect to a Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The Fortify on Demand Plugin (versions 5.0.1 and earlier) lacks proper permission checks in a method used for form validation. This allows users with `Overall/Read` access to interact with the Fortify on Demand endpoint, which is not intended.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The same form validation method does not require POST requests. This makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks, as a malicious attacker can trick a user's browser into making an unauthorized request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Attackers can exploit the lack of POST request enforcement to trick victims into submitting unauthorized requests to the Jenkins server.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** Inadequate permission checks allow users with `Overall/Read` access to bypass security measures and access the Fortify on Demand endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Fortify on Demand:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This means an attacker could potentially use a victim's authenticated session to modify the Fortify on Demand configuration.
*   **Potential Data Exposure/Manipulation**: Depending on the permissions available in the Fortify on Demand application, the attacker may gain access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is initiated over the network by crafting a malicious request.
*   **CSRF:** The lack of POST request validation allows the use of CSRF attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins Overall/Read Access:** The attacker must have at least `Overall/Read` permissions on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Access to Valid Credentials ID:** The attacker must obtain valid Fortify on Demand credentials ID through another vulnerability (CVE-2020-2202)

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability resides within the form validation mechanism of the Fortify on Demand plugin.
*   The specific method implementing form validation is not specified within the content.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0, which enforces proper permission checks for the form validation method.
*   The advisory also notes that the same vulnerability is associated with CVE-2020-2204 as a missing permission check vulnerability
