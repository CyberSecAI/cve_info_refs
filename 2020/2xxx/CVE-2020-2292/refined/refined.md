Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2292:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Release Plugin not properly escaping the release version within the badge tooltip.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. The plugin renders user-provided input (the release version) without sanitization in the tooltip of the release badge. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view a release build with the crafted release version.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could potentially steal session cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can potentially alter the page content, redirect users, or perform other malicious activities within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Release Version:** An attacker would need to create a release build with a specifically crafted release version containing the malicious JavaScript.
- **User Interaction:** The exploit requires a user to view a page that displays the release badge tooltip with the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Release/Release Permission:** An attacker needs the "Release/Release" permission within the Jenkins instance to trigger a release build with the crafted release version and exploit the vulnerability.
