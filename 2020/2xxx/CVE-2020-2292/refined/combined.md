# Release

This plugin adds the ability to wrap your job with pre- and post- build steps which are only executed when a manual release build is triggered.

Additional plugin integration

Supports the [Dashboard View](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view/) with the Recent Releases portlet and the [Promoted Builds Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/promoted-builds/) with the Release build condition.

# Configure the job to enable releasing

On the job configuration page, enable the release build configuration under the Build Wrapper heading and add your required release version template string, release [parameters](https://plugins.jenkins.io/parameterized-trigger/), pre and post build steps that you need to complete a release.

### Release Version Template

The release version template was added in version 1.7 of the release plugin.  This parameter lets you define how the release plugin identifies the release of the project.  This is done by building a parameter based template which is resolved at release time to a fully resolved string.  For instance, the template can be: Release: ${releaseVersion}.  This will instruct the release plugin to use the value of the parameter name releaseVersion to come up with the fully identifying string which will then be used as a description of the release build and as a tooltip on the release build icon on the historical build list.

### Release Parameters

The release parameters let you define various parameters that are presented to the user when a release is requested.  The list of available parameter types are the same as those available in the parameterized build option for Jenkins.

### Build Steps

The build steps section is used to define arbitrary actions to run before and after the standard job build steps run. These are the same build steps offered as the build steps available in the free style job type.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/release-plugin@master/docs/images/config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/release-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/config.png)

In my experience, a release build typically requires pre-build steps of validating the project is releasable and bumping the version to the release version. After the build runs as usual, the post build steps are labeling the codebase and bumping the version to the next development version.

# Executing a release

To run a release, click the Release icon from the job home page. This will bring you to the release details page where you will be prompted to fill in any parameters that you have defined (or the default RELEASE\_VERSION and DEVELOPMENT\_VERSION if there were no parameters defined).  As seen above, these values are then available at job execution time in both the pre and post release steps as well as the normal build steps. Finally, click the schedule release build and the job is scheduled to run immediately, now including the execution of the pre and post build steps.

# Viewing results

Once the build is complete, the release plugin automatically locks the build, preventing it from being automatically deleted and adds a release icon denoting it as a release build.

# Supported Job Types

The release plugin supports the Maven2 and Free Style Job type

# Recent Releases Portlet

The release plugin contributes a recent releases portlet that can be used in a [Dashboard View](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view/).

This portlet shows the 5 most recent release builds in normal mode with a link that brings you to the build page and the version string. [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/release-plugin@master/docs/images/normal-mode.PNG)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/release-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/normal-mode.PNG)
 In the maximized mode, it shows the 50 most recent builds with additional detail.  Additionally, it offers an rss feed while in the maximized mode so that you can get notified of all release builds or all failing release builds.

SECURITY-1767 / CVE-2020-2286
Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.12 and newer uses a cache to
speed up permission lookups.

In Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.0 and earlier this cache is
not invalidated properly when an administrator changes the permission
configuration. This can result in permissions being granted long after the
configuration was changed to no longer grant them.

SECURITY-1815 / CVE-2020-2287
Audit Trail Plugin logs requests whose URL path matches an admin-configured
regular expression.

A discrepancy between the behavior of the plugin and the Stapler web
framework in parsing URL paths allows attackers to craft URLs that would
bypass request logging in Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier.

SECURITY-1846 / CVE-2020-2288
Audit Trail Plugin uses regular expressions to match requested URLs whose
dispatch should be logged.

In Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier, the default regular expression
pattern could be bypassed in many cases by adding a suffix to the URL that
would be ignored during request handling.

SECURITY-1954 / CVE-2020-2289
Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape the name and
description of build parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2008 / CVE-2020-2290
Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape `List` and `Map`
return values of sandboxed scripts for _Reactive Reference Parameter_.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-2065 / CVE-2020-2291
couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores its server password
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.couchstats.CouchStatsConfig.xml` on the Jenkins
controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller
file system.

SECURITY-1928 / CVE-2020-2292
Release Plugin 2.10.2 and earlier does not escape the release version in
the badge tooltip.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Release/Release permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2046 / CVE-2020-2293
Persona Plugin 2.4 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read permission to
read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2049 / CVE-2020-2294 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2295 (CSRF)
Maven Cascade Release Plugin 1.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start cascade builds
and layout builds, and reconfigure the plugin.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2052 / CVE-2020-2296
Shared Objects Plugin 0.44 and earlier does not require POST requests for
an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to configure shared objects.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2054 / CVE-2020-2297
SMS Notification Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores an access token unencrypted
in its global configuration file
`com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller as
part of its configuration.

This access token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins
controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2097 / CVE-2020-2298
Nerrvana Plugin 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a
crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

Additionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that
does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without
Overall/Read permission via CSRF.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Descriptions

### Improper authorization due to caching in Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin

**SECURITY-1767
/
CVE-2020-2286**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`role-strategy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy)**

**Description:**

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.12 and newer uses a cache to speed up permission lookups.

In Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.0 and earlier this cache is not invalidated properly when an administrator changes the permission configuration.
This can result in permissions being granted long after the configuration was changed to no longer grant them.

Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.1 properly invalidates the cache on configuration changes.

### Request logging could be bypassed in Audit Trail Plugin

**SECURITY-1815
/
CVE-2020-2287**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`audit-trail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail)**

**Description:**

Audit Trail Plugin logs requests whose URL path matches an admin-configured regular expression.

A discrepancy between the behavior of the plugin and the Stapler web framework in parsing URL paths allows attackers to craft URLs that would bypass request logging in Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier.
This only applies to Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, as the fix for [SECURITY-1774](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1774) prohibits dispatch of affected requests.

Audit Trail Plugin 3.7 processes request URL paths the same way as the Stapler web framework.

### Incorrect default pattern in Audit Trail Plugin

**SECURITY-1846
/
CVE-2020-2288**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`audit-trail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/audit-trail)**

**Description:**

Audit Trail Plugin uses regular expressions to match requested URLs whose dispatch should be logged.

In Audit Trail Plugin 3.6 and earlier, the default regular expression pattern could be bypassed in many cases by adding a suffix to the URL that would be ignored during request handling.

Audit Trail Plugin 3.7 changes the default regular expression pattern so that it allows for arbitrary suffixes.
It automatically will replace previous default patterns with the new, more complete default pattern.

Additionally, an administrative monitor is shown if a user-specified pattern is found to be bypassable through crafted URLs and form validation was improved to recognize patterns that would not match requests with arbitrary suffixes.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Active Choices Plugin

**SECURITY-1954
/
CVE-2020-2289**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`uno-choice`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice)**

**Description:**

Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape the name and description of build parameters.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

Active Choices Plugin 2.5 escapes the name of build parameters and applies the configured markup formatter to the description of build parameters.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Active Choices Plugin

**SECURITY-2008
/
CVE-2020-2290**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`uno-choice`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/uno-choice)**

**Description:**

Active Choices Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape `List` and `Map` return values of sandboxed scripts for *Reactive Reference Parameter*.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

This issue is caused by an incomplete fix for [SECURITY-470](/security/advisory/2017-10-23/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-active-choices-plugin).

Active Choices Plugin 2.5 escapes all legal return values of sandboxed scripts.

### Password stored in plain text by couchdb-statistics Plugin

**SECURITY-2065
/
CVE-2020-2291**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`couchdb-statistics`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/couchdb-statistics)**

**Description:**

couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores its server password unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.couchstats.CouchStatsConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

couchdb-statistics Plugin 0.4 stores its server password encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Release Plugin

**SECURITY-1928
/
CVE-2020-2292**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/release)**

**Description:**

Release Plugin 2.10.2 and earlier does not escape the release version in the badge tooltip.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Release/Release permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Persona Plugin

**SECURITY-2046
/
CVE-2020-2293**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`persona`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/persona)**

**Description:**

Persona Plugin 2.4 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Maven Cascade Release Plugin

**SECURITY-2049
/
CVE-2020-2294 (permission check), CVE-2020-2295 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`maven-release-cascade`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-release-cascade)**

**Description:**

Maven Cascade Release Plugin 1.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start cascade builds and layout builds, and reconfigure the plugin.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability in Shared Objects Plugin

**SECURITY-2052
/
CVE-2020-2296**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`shared-objects`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shared-objects)**

**Description:**

Shared Objects Plugin 0.44 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to configure shared objects.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Access token stored in plain text by SMS Notification Plugin

**SECURITY-2054
/
CVE-2020-2297**

[`sms`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sms)**

**Description:**

SMS Notification Plugin 1.2 and earlier stores an access token unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

This access token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XXE vulnerability in Nerrvana Plugin

**SECURITY-2097
/
CVE-2020-2298**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`nerrvana-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nerrvana-plugin)**

**Description:**

Nerrvana Plugin 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Additionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without Overall/Read permission via CSRF.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
