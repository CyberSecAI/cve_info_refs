Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Compact Columns Plugin displays the job description in tooltips without proper processing, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the job description. When a user hovers over the job item, the injected script executes in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Unauthorized actions
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the Jenkins UI

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with `Job/Configure` permission can insert malicious code into the job description.
- When another user views the tooltips on that job (typically through UI interaction), the malicious script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Job/Configure` permission on the Jenkins instance, meaning they need to be authenticated and authorized.
- The attacker must be able to modify job descriptions through the Jenkins UI.
