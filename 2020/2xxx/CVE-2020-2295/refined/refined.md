Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-2295:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Maven Cascade Release Plugin does not require POST requests for specific HTTP endpoints. This allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit the lack of POST request requirement to trick a user into performing unwanted actions such as reconfiguring the plugin, and starting cascade and layout builds, if the user is authenticated to the Jenkins instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker crafts a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated user, triggers the vulnerable endpoints on the Jenkins server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to entice an authenticated Jenkins user to visit a crafted web page or click a malicious link.
- The user must have Overall/Read permission for the permission check vulnerability, and no specific permission needed for CSRF exploitation if the user is logged in.
