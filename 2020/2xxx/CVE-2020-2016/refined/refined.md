- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition exists due to the insecure creation of a file in a temporary directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation leading to a race condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges from a limited linux user account to root.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low-privilege administrator account with the ability to escape the restricted shell, potentially by exploiting another vulnerability.
