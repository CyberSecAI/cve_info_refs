Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Credentials Binding Plugin, when handling secrets containing `$` characters, escapes them to `$$`. While the plugin correctly masks the original secret, it fails to mask the escaped version (`$$`) before it's expanded back to `$` during build steps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Secret Masking:** The plugin does not mask the escaped form of secrets containing `$` characters when they are used in build steps, which allows these secrets to be exposed in the build logs.
-   The vulnerability is a side effect of the fix for SECURITY-698

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view the unmasked secrets in the build logs. This is considered a low severity as it requires specific conditions to be met.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered when a secret containing `$` characters is used as an environment variable within Jenkins, and when the 'Execute Maven top-level targets' build step is used (or similar steps that trigger variable expansion)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have low level access within the Jenkins environment (e.g., having the ability to view build logs) and be able to configure a job that uses the affected plugin with a secret containing '$' character.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Credentials Binding Plugin versions 1.22 and earlier.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 1.23 of the plugin, which masks both the original and escaped forms of secrets.
