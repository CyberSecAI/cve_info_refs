Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Chaos Monkey Plugin, in versions 0.3 and earlier, did not implement proper permission checks on several of its HTTP endpoints. This lack of authorization allowed unauthorized users to trigger actions that should have been restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing authorization checks:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of permission checks on multiple HTTP endpoints within the Chaos Monkey plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource exhaustion:** Attackers with "Overall/Read" permission can generate load on the Jenkins server.
*   **Memory leaks:** Attackers with "Overall/Read" permission can trigger memory leaks, potentially impacting the stability and performance of the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending HTTP requests to specific endpoints within the Chaos Monkey plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials with at least "Overall/Read" permission in Jenkins.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Chaos Monkey Plugin version 0.4, which requires "Overall/Administer" permission to trigger the mentioned actions, thus fixing the missing permission checks.
*   This vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-2109 (1) in the Jenkins security advisory.
