Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Amazon EC2 Plugin, versions 1.50.1 and earlier, does not perform SSH host key validation when connecting to agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of SSH host key validation. This allows for the possibility of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially intercept connections between the Jenkins controller and build agents.
- This interception could be used to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or manipulate build processes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network path between the Jenkins controller and the EC2 agent instances.
- This attack would involve an attacker positioning themselves between the two endpoints and intercepting/modifying communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins controller and the EC2 build agents. This might involve:
    - Being on the same network as either the controller or the agent.
    - Compromising a network device in between.
    - Possibly being a malicious administrator within the environment.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding support for host key validation strategies in the plugin version 1.50.2
- The updated plugin provides several strategies (Check New Hard, Check New Soft, Accept New, and Off) with varying levels of security to address this vulnerability.
- The documentation encourages upgrading to the most secure strategy, 'Check New Hard', when possible.
