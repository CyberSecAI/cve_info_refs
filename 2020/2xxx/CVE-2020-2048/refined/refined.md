Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2048:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the system proxy server password being logged in clear text when viewing the system state via the CLI in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure Through Log Files (CWE-532):** The system proxy password, which should be treated as sensitive information, is written to a log file in plain text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (Low):** A local attacker with access to the system logs can potentially obtain the cleartext password for the system proxy server. This could allow an attacker to potentially intercept or redirect network traffic if they have the ability to control that infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  An attacker needs to have local access to the PAN-OS device to view the system state via the CLI and access the log file containing the password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access to the PAN-OS device:** The attacker must have command-line access to the affected PAN-OS device.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges on the system to execute the commands to view system state and access relevant logs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is triggered only when a system proxy server is configured on the firewall.
- Palo Alto Networks was not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.
- The vulnerability was discovered by a customer during an internal security review.
- The issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.17, 9.0.11, 9.1.2 and later versions.
- A workaround/mitigation is mentioned, recommending users follow best practices for securing management web interface.
