* gitlab-hook
  Plugin
* [Health Advisor by CloudBees
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)
* [Redgate SQL Change Automation

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1004
/
CVE-2020-2090 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2091 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.47 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

|  | This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible. |
| --- | --- |

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.48 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### XXE vulnerability in Robot Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1698
/
CVE-2020-2092**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`robot`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/robot)**

**Description:**

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.0 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin

**SECURITY-1708
/
CVE-2020-2093 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2094 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-jenkins-advisor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)**

**Description:**

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1696
/
CVE-2020-2095**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`redgate-sql-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/redgate-sql-ci)**

**Description:**

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

This is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1598](/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598).

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in gitlab-hook Plugin

**SECURITY-1683
/
CVE-2020-2096**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-hook`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-hook)**

**Description:**

gitlab-hook Plugin 1.4.2 and earlier does not escape project names in the `build_now` endpoint.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Sounds Plugin allow OS command execution

**SECURITY-814
/
CVE-2020-2097 (permission check), CVE-2020-2098 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`sounds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sounds)**

**Description:**

Sounds Plugin 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs performing form validation.
This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Sounds

How to install

* [Documentation](/sounds/)
* [Releases](/sounds/releases/)
* [Issues](/sounds/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/sounds/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/sounds/healthscore/)

## Overview

This plugin is able to play audio clips locally through sound hardware, remotely by piping them through an operating system command, or simultaneously through all browsers that are on a Jenkins page.

When outputting through local hardware, Sounds requires that the Jenkins' server machine has a working sound card and speaker that is not in a remote server room where there's no one around to hear it.

Jenkins can execute a command on a remote machine to play a sound sent through a pipe. This is normally an SSH command to a remote Linux based host that has a working sound card (e.g. '`ssh <host> play -`').

If you have HTML5 Audio capable browsers you can configure Sounds to play sounds through all the browsers that are on a Jenkins page.

## Compatibility

For all of the options there are varying degrees of support for the multitude of audio file formats. The most widely supported (but the most inefficient) is WAV.

## Triggering Sounds

### Configured build action

A job can be configured to play a sound as part of its action. You can have jobs dedicated to playing sounds on a schedule, or have the job play a sound as it does other actions.

### Configured post-build actions

The build configuration allows you to select a sound to be played for any build state transition. You can configure:

* for any possible build result
* a list of previous build results
* the sound to play

### External trigger

A sound can also be triggered by making an HTTP POST request and passing a URL to the sound to be played. This enables external tools to play sounds through Jenkins.

```
<Jenkins URL>/sounds/playSound?src=file:///home/jenkins/sounds/somesound.wav

```

### Customising the sound archive

#### Making a sound archive

The sound archive is a simple .zip or .jar file containing sound files.

Jenkins analyses each file to detect whether it is a valid sound file supported by JavaSound. JavaSound supports AIFF, AU and WAV, see [formats](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/formats-138492.html#Formats).

NOTE: The filename extension does not guarantee that the format is supported. If you have a file that doesn't play, try passing it though an conversion tool.

Jenkins ignores the archive folder structure (to simplify packaging) and uses the file name less extension as an ID, so keep the archive flat, or avoid having the same filename in multiple folders.

#### Publishing your sound archive

Jenkins Sounds can read an archive from the local filing system, or an HTTP URL.

* publish the archive on a local web server and use `http://`
* put the archive in Jenkins' local filing system and use `file://`

NOTE: Jenkins streams the audio from the archive for each event (to reduce memory requirements), so make sure it's not too far away.

#### Configure Jenkins to use your archive

Within the Configure System section of Jenkins Management locate the settings for Jenkins Sounds.

Enter the path to the archive.

* Absolute `http://` and `file://` URLs will be used unmodified.
* URIs without a protocol will be assumed to be filing system references and converted to `file://` URLs.

After changing the sound archive location URL you must save the form before being able to test the sounds.

The Test Sound advanced option shows a list of the sounds found in the archive and their supported format.
