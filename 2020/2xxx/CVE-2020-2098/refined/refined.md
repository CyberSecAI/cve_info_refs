Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-2098:

**CVE-2020-2098:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Sounds Plugin does not perform permission checks on URLs used for form validation and these URLs do not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin allows access to sensitive functionality without proper authorization. Specifically, users with `Overall/Read` access can trigger actions they shouldn't be able to perform.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of POST request enforcement allows an attacker to craft a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by an authenticated user, will cause the vulnerable function to be executed by their browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the Jenkins user account. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker can exploit the lack of CSRF protection by enticing a logged-in Jenkins user to click a malicious link or load a malicious webpage.
    *   **Direct Request (if known):** While CSRF is the most likely exploit method, if an attacker discovers the form validation URLs they could directly request them.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Overall/Read access:** The attacker needs at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance
    *   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a logged-in user to interact with a malicious link or webpage (in the case of CSRF).

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The Sounds Plugin before version 0.6 has a critical vulnerability. Due to missing permission checks and CSRF protection, an attacker with low privileges (`Overall/Read`) can trick a Jenkins user into executing arbitrary system commands, leading to a complete compromise of the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that as of its publication, there is no fix for this vulnerability. The provided changelog for Sounds Plugin mentions security fixes in version 0.6, explicitly referencing this issue.
*   The changelog also mentions that the fixes include enforcing POST requests and security on administration of the plugin settings, which directly addresses the root causes of the vulnerabilities.
