Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Plugin Installation Manager Tool, used in Jenkins Docker images to download and install plugins, did not verify the integrity of plugin downloads using checksums.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Lack of integrity checks on downloaded plugins. The tool didn't confirm if the actual checksum of the downloaded plugin matched the expected checksum.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-  An attacker, such as a mirror operator or other third party, could provide crafted or malicious plugin downloads. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior within the Jenkins environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

-  Man-in-the-middle attacks or compromised mirrors could be used to intercept the plugin download process and replace legitimate plugins with malicious ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate the plugin downloads. This could be achieved by controlling a mirror used by the Plugin Installation Manager Tool or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack on the download process.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Plugin Installation Manager Tool versions 2.1.3 and earlier.
- Version 2.2.0 and later implement checksum verification, mitigating the vulnerability.
- The advisory provides example commands to upgrade the tool in older Jenkins docker images.
