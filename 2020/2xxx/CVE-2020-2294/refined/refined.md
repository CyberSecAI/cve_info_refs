Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2294:

**CVE-2020-2294:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Maven Cascade Release Plugin does not perform permission checks on several HTTP endpoints.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Missing permission checks on multiple HTTP endpoints.
    *   Lack of CSRF protection as the affected endpoints do not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can start cascade builds and layout builds.
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can reconfigure the plugin.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   An attacker can trigger HTTP requests without requiring a POST method, bypassing CSRF protection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user into sending requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Summary:**

The Maven Cascade Release Plugin has a vulnerability due to missing permission checks and a lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with Overall/Read permission can exploit the missing permission check to trigger builds and reconfigure the plugin. Attackers can also leverage the missing CSRF protection to trigger actions by tricking an authenticated user into sending crafted requests.
