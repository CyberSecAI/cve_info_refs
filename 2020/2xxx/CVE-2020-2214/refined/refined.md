Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2214:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The ZAP Pipeline Plugin disables the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header for static files served by Jenkins. This header is normally set by Jenkins to protect against XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Disabled Content-Security-Policy:** The plugin disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header, which is a crucial security mechanism designed to prevent XSS attacks by controlling the resources that the browser is allowed to load.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By disabling CSP, the plugin allows for stored XSS attacks. Attackers who can control content within workspaces, archived artifacts, or `/userContent` can inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject and execute malicious JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions.
*   **Data theft/manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data, or even manipulate displayed content.
*   **Account takeover:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to take over user accounts by stealing session tokens.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File manipulation:** Users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, or `/userContent` can introduce malicious content.
*   **File parameter downloads:** Specifically for older Jenkins versions, file parameter downloads can be used to deliver malicious payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **User with control over files:** The attacker needs to be a user who has the ability to write files to areas like Jenkins workspaces, archived artifacts, or `/userContent`.
*   **Jenkins access:** The attacker needs access to the Jenkins instance to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **UI Interaction**: The user must interact with the malicious content, likely by browsing to a page that includes the vulnerable content.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is particularly significant for Jenkins versions between 2.228 and 2.230, including the 2.222.x LTS and 2.204.6 LTS releases, as file parameters were not served via the Resource Root URL.
*   Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, are less affected due to Resource Root URL functionality. However, even in these versions file parameters downloads could pose a threat.
* The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin 1.9 and earlier. There is no fix at the time of advisory.
