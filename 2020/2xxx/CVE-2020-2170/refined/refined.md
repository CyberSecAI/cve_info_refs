Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2170:

**CVE-2020-2170**

*   **Root Cause:** The RapidDeploy Plugin does not properly escape package names when displaying a table of packages obtained from a remote server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of output sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts within the displayed package names.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed within the context of a victim's browser when they view the job configuration page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with the ability to configure jobs and therefore control the remote server responses related to package names can inject malicious code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the permission to configure jobs, which provides the ability to influence the package names shown in the table.

**Summary:** The vulnerability exists because the RapidDeploy plugin does not sanitize the package names it displays in the table, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker with job configuration permissions can exploit this to inject malicious scripts.
