Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2260:

**CVE-2020-2260**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `perfecto` plugin lacks a permission check in a method that performs a connection test.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Missing permission check, allowing unauthorized access to connection test functionality.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can connect to an attacker-specified HTTP URL with attacker-specified credentials. This could lead to information disclosure or further exploitation by sending malicious requests to the attacker controlled URL.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting the HTTP endpoints related to connection testing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Attacker needs `Overall/Read` permissions in Jenkins.

**Summary:**

The `perfecto` plugin had a vulnerability where a connection test method did not properly check permissions, which allows an attacker to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials. This could allow for the exfiltration of credentials or could allow further attacks.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable version of the plugin is 1.17 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 1.18.
