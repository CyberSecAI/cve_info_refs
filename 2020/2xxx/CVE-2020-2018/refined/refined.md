Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2018:

**Root Cause:**
- An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Panorama context switching feature. This allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Panorama handles authentication during context switching between managed firewalls. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker privileged access to managed firewalls.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact (High):** This high level of access means the attacker can potentially read sensitive data, modify firewall configurations, and disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Panorama management interface.
- **Knowledge of Managed Firewalls:** The attacker requires some knowledge of the managed firewalls to exploit the issue successfully.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Panorama management interface.
- The attacker requires some knowledge of the managed firewalls to leverage the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required, and the attacker can be unauthenticated to initiate the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by enabling custom certificates for authentication between Panorama and managed firewalls.
- The issue affects several versions of PAN-OS, including:
  - PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26
  - PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.12
  - PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6
  - All versions of PAN-OS 8.0
