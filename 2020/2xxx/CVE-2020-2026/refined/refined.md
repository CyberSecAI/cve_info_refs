  "CVE-2020-2026": {
    "description": "A malicious guest compromised before a container creation (e.g. a malicious guest image or a guest running multiple containers) can trick the kata runtime into mounting the untrusted container filesystem on any host path, potentially allowing for code execution on the host.",
    "root_cause": "The kata runtime does not properly restrict containers from accessing or modifying the host filesystem when mounting the container's filesystem, which can be exploited by malicious containers to gain code execution on the host.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Execution with unnecessary privileges",
      "Link Following"
    ],
     "impact": "Remote Code Execution on the host",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest image",
