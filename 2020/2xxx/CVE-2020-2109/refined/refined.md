Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-2109:

**CVE-2020-2109**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sandbox protection within the Pipeline: Groovy plugin. Specifically, default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods were not being properly sandboxed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Sandbox Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended sandbox restrictions. By exploiting the lack of proper sandboxing for default parameter expressions within CPS-transformed methods, malicious code could execute outside of the intended restrictions.
    *   **Code Execution:**  The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins controller's JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
    *   **Full System Compromise:** Because the code execution happens in the context of the Jenkins controller, it could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the Jenkins server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Pipeline Definition:** Attackers can inject malicious code through the definition of a Pipeline script. Specifically, they would craft default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods to exploit the lack of sandboxing.
    *   **Sandboxed Pipeline Execution:** This vulnerability is exploitable by any user able to define and run sandboxed pipeline scripts.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Define Pipelines:** An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify Jenkins pipeline definitions, which would typically require the ability to create Jenkins jobs or edit existing jobs.
    *  **Sandboxed Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the pipelines under sandbox restrictions.
    * **Basic understanding of Groovy and Jenkins Pipelines:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious default parameter expression.
*   **Affected Component:** Pipeline: Groovy Plugin (workflow-cps) versions 2.78 and earlier.
*   **Fix:** The issue was addressed in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin version 2.79, which implemented proper sandboxing for default parameter expressions.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows attackers with the ability to create and run sandboxed Jenkins pipelines to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by crafting malicious default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods within Pipeline scripts.
