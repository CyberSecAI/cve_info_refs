Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2226:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin does not properly escape user names shown in the permission table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the permission table. This script would then execute in the browser of other users viewing the permission table, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Credential theft
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious actions depending on the permissions of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user with the necessary permissions configures the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin and includes a user name that contains malicious script.
- The injected script is stored in the Jenkins system and executed when another user views the permission table.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs one of the following permissions:
    -  `Job/Configure` or `Agent/Configure` permission when using project-based matrix authorization.
    - `Overall/Administer` permission otherwise.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify user names that are then displayed in the permissions table.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin versions 2.6.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.2 by escaping user names in the permission table.
