Implement fine-grained access control in Jenkins with this plugin.

For a basic introduction, see [the section on Matrix Authorization in the Jenkins handbook](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/security/#authorization).

## Changelog

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-auth-plugin/releases) (2.6.5 and newer only) or [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-auth-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) (before 3.0 only).

## Use Cases

Matrix Authorization allows configuring the lowest level permissions, such as starting new builds, configuring items, or deleting them, individually.

### Project-based configuration

Project-based matrix authorization allows configuring permissions for each item or agent independently. Permission applying to such items or agents that are granted in the global configuration apply to all of them, unless they don't inherit global permissions (see below).

### Permission inheritance

With project-based matrix authorization, permissions are by inherited from the global configuration and any parent entities (e.g. the folder a job is in) by default. This can be changed. Depending on the entity being configured, all or a subset of the following *inheritance strategies* are available:

* Inherit permissions: This is the default behavior. Permissions explicitly granted on individual items or agents will only add to permissions defined globally or in any parent items.
* Inherit global configuration only: This will only inherit permissions granted globally, but not those granted on parent folders. This way, jobs in folders can control access independently from their parent folder.
* Do not inherit permissions: The most restrictive inheritance configuration. Only permissions defined explicitly on this agent or item will be granted. The only exception is Overall/Administer: It is not possible to remove access to an agent or item from Jenkins administrators.

### Configuration as Code and Job DSL support

Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin has full support for use in Configuration as Code and Job DSL.

For an example combining the two, see [this `configuration-as-code.yml` test resource](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-auth-plugin/blob/master/src/test/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/matrixauth/integrations/casc/configuration-as-code-v3.yml).

## Caveats

When using project-based matrix authorization, users granted permission to configure items or agents will be able to grant themselves all other permissions on the item or agent. These would be inherited unless specifically disabled.

Beyond the above, administrators implementing fine-grained permissions control need to be aware of interactions between permissions, and certain overlap between them. Some examples:

* A user not granted read access to Jenkins in general will not be able to use most of the other permissions they've been granted -- likely none of them.
* A user not granted read access to a job will not be able to start new builds, delete the job, configure the job, etc.
* When using global matrix authorization, users granted permission to configure jobs but not start them will still be able to configure the job to be periodically executed.
* Some permissions imply others. Most notably, Overall/Administer implies (almost) all other permissions, but other implications exist: For example, Job/Read implies Job/Discover. Descriptions for permissions will note when a permission is either implied by a permission other than Overall/Administer, or when it is not implied by any other permission.

SECURITY-1868 / CVE-2020-2220
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
agent name on build time trend pages. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure
permission.

SECURITY-1901 / CVE-2020-2221
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1902 / CVE-2020-2222
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the job
name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip. This results in a
stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able
to configure job names.

As job names do not generally support the character set needed for XSS,
this is believed to be difficult to exploit in common configurations.

SECURITY-1945 / CVE-2020-2223
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
`href` attribute of links to downstream jobs displayed in the build console
page. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1924 / CVE-2020-2224
Matrix Project Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not escape node names shown in
tooltips on the overview page of builds with a single axis. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
Agent/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1925 / CVE-2020-2225
Matrix Project Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not escape the axis names shown
in tooltips on the overview page of builds with multiple axes. This results
in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users
with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1909 / CVE-2020-2226
Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.6.1 and earlier does not escape user
names shown in the permission table. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. When using project-based matrix
authorization, this vulnerability can be exploited by a user with
Job/Configure or Agent/Configure permission, otherwise by users with
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1915 / CVE-2020-2227
Deployer Framework Plugin is a framework plugin allowing other plugins to
provide a way to deploy artifacts. Deployer Framework Plugin 1.2 and
earlier does not escape the URL displayed in the build home page. This
results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide the location.

The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specific
implementation using Deployer Framework Plugin. The Jenkins security team
is not aware of any exploitable implementation.

SECURITY-1792 / CVE-2020-2228
Gitlab Authentication Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not differentiate between
user names and hierarchical group names when performing authorization. This
allows an attacker with permissions to create groups in GitLab to gain the
privileges granted to another user or group.
