Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2310:

**CVE-2020-2310**

*   **Root Cause:** The Ansible Plugin, in versions 1.0 and earlier, lacks permission checks in its form validation methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Missing permission checks on methods used for form validation. This allows unauthorized access to information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can enumerate credentials IDs stored within Jenkins. This information can be used to further compromise the system by capturing the credentials through other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can send requests to the affected endpoints to enumerate credentials IDs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission in Jenkins.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the Ansible Plugin allows an attacker to enumerate credentials IDs stored in Jenkins due to missing permission checks in form validation methods. This could lead to further exploits if the attacker leverages these IDs.
