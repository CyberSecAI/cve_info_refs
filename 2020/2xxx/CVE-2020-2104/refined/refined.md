  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Jenkins application allows access to the JVM memory usage chart with Overall/Read permissions instead of requiring Overall/Administer permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can view JVM memory usage data, potentially gaining insight into the application's performance and resource consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the Jenkins instance"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance."
