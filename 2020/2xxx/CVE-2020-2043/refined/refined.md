Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2043:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how PAN-OS handles sensitive fields when the "after-change-detail" custom syslog field is enabled for configuration logs. When a sensitive field appears multiple times within a single log entry, only the first instance is masked; subsequent instances are logged in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure through Log Files (CWE-532):** Sensitive information, such as passwords, is logged in clear text in configuration logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (LOW):** An attacker with access to the log files could potentially view sensitive information, such as passwords, that are not properly masked.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** This vulnerability does not impact the integrity or availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires access to the PAN-OS log files generated by the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs local access to the system and its log files, which may be possible with low-level privileges.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker does not need to interact with a user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists only when the `after-change-detail` custom syslog field is enabled for configuration logs.
- This affects PAN-OS versions 8.1 prior to 8.1.16, 9.0 prior to 9.0.10, and 9.1 prior to 9.1.4.
- The issue was discovered internally by a Palo Alto Networks customer.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in PAN-OS versions 8.1.16, 9.0.10, 9.1.4, and later versions.
- Mitigations involve securing access to the PAN-OS management interface and following best practices as outlined in the PAN-OS technical documentation.
