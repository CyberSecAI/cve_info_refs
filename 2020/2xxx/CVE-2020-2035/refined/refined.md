{
  "CVE-2020-2035": {
    "Description": "The PAN-OS URL filtering feature inspects the HTTP Host and URL path headers for policy enforcement on decrypted HTTPS web transactions but does not consider the Server Name Indication (SNI) field within the TLS Client Hello handshake. This allows a compromised host in a protected network to evade URL filtering policies when SSL/TLS Forward Proxy Decryption is enabled. A malicious actor can then use this technique to evade detection of communication on the TLS handshake phase between a compromised host and a remote malicious server.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that PAN-OS URL filtering only inspects the HTTP Host and URL path headers of decrypted HTTPS traffic and not the Server Name Indication (SNI) field in the TLS handshake.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) - The PAN-OS software fails to properly validate the SNI field, allowing attackers to use it for malicious purposes.",
        "Bypass of URL filtering policies on decrypted HTTPS sessions"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A compromised host within a protected network can bypass URL filtering policies, allowing for covert communication with malicious servers and data exfiltration. It does not directly increase the risk of a host being compromised and does not affect confidentiality or availability, but it does impact the integrity of the firewall by failing to enforce policies on certain traffic.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack is network-based, involving a compromised host within the protected network sending manipulated TLS handshakes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have already compromised a host within the protected network and be able to control the traffic originating from that host. They also require that SSL/TLS Decryption Forward Proxy mode be enabled on the firewall for the traffic they control."
