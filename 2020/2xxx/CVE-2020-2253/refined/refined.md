Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2253:

**Root Cause:**
The Email Extension Plugin does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing hostname validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: Attackers can intercept SMTP connections, potentially gaining access to sensitive information transmitted during email sending.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based MITM attack: An attacker positioned between the Jenkins server and the SMTP server can intercept and potentially modify the communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MITM attack on the network traffic between the Jenkins instance and the SMTP server.
- No special privileges are required on the Jenkins server itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Email Extension Plugin versions 2.75 and earlier.
- Version 2.76 of the plugin validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
- Administrators can enable hostname validation in earlier versions (2.75 and below) by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup.
- This protection can be disabled by setting the same property to `false`.
- The protection can be configured via the 'Advanced Email Properties' field in the pluginâ€™s configuration.
