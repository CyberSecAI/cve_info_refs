Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-2245:

**CVE-2020-2245**

*   **Root Cause:** The Valgrind Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who can control the input files for the Valgrind plugin parser can have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities. This can lead to extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
*  **Attack vector:** An attacker must be able to control the input files parsed by the Valgrind plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to control the XML input files that the Valgrind plugin processes. This likely requires a degree of access to the Jenkins environment or the build process where the Valgrind plugin is used.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Valgrind Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.28 and earlier.
*   **Fix:** No fix available at the time of the advisory publication.
