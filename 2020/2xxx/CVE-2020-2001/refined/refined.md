Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "external control of path and data" issue within the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Panorama XSLT processing logic. This means an attacker can manipulate the paths and data used in XSLT processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **External Control of Path and Data:** Attackers can influence the file paths and data used in the XSLT processing, allowing them to write arbitrary files on the system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to write arbitrary files allows an attacker to elevate their privileges on the system.
- **CWE-123 Write-what-where Condition**: The vulnerability falls under the CWE-123 classification, which involves the ability to write attacker-controlled data to attacker-controlled locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High - Attackers can potentially read sensitive data on the system.
- **Integrity Impact:** High - Attackers can modify system files, leading to data corruption or system instability.
- **Availability Impact:** High - Attackers can potentially cause a denial-of-service or disrupt critical services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
- **PAN-OS Management Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the PAN-OS management web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the PAN-OS management interface.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- All PAN-OS 7.1 Panorama versions.
- All PAN-OS 8.0 Panorama versions.
- PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.12 on Panorama.
- PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6 on Panorama.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.12, PAN-OS 9.0.6, and all later PAN-OS versions.
- Following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management web interface can mitigate the impact.
