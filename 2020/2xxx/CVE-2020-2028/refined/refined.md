Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2028:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an OS command injection flaw within the PAN-OS management server. This occurs during the process of uploading a new certificate when the system is operating in FIPS-CC mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data, specifically during the certificate upload process. This allows an attacker to inject malicious OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges on the affected PAN-OS device.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining root access means an attacker can potentially take complete control of the device, leading to significant impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network using the PAN-OS management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must be a legitimate, authenticated administrator to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the management interface of the vulnerable PAN-OS system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects multiple PAN-OS versions, including:
    *   All versions of PAN-OS 7.1 and 8.0.
    *   PAN-OS 8.1 versions prior to 8.1.13
    *   PAN-OS 9.0 versions prior to 9.0.7
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.13, 9.0.7, 9.1.0, and later versions. Palo Alto Networks also recommends following best practices for securing administrative access to the PAN-OS management interface as a mitigation.
*   **FIPS-CC Mode:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the device is operating in FIPS-CC mode.
*   **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered internally by Nicholas Newsom of Palo Alto Networks.
