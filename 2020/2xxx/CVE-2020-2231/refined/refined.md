Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jenkins application fails to properly sanitize the remote address of the host that initiates a build via the 'Trigger builds remotely' feature. Specifically, it doesn't escape the remote address, which can contain malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the unescaped remote address is stored and later displayed within the Jenkins interface, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view the build information.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking, where the attacker can take control of the victim's Jenkins session.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive information, such as credentials stored in Jenkins or other data accessible through the application.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could use the compromised session to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Trigger builds remotely:** An attacker can trigger a build using the 'Trigger builds remotely' feature. The attacker crafts a malicious remote address that includes JavaScript code. This crafted address is then stored by Jenkins.
*   **Stored XSS:** When a user views the build information that includes the attacker's malicious remote address, the JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Job/Configure Permission:** The attacker needs to have "Job/Configure" permissions for the target Jenkins job in order to exploit this.
*   **Authentication Token Knowledge:** Alternatively, an attacker can exploit this if they have knowledge of the Authentication Token used for 'Trigger builds remotely'. This token is used to authenticate the build triggering mechanism, and if an attacker has it, they could initiate builds with a malicious address, even without Job/Configure permission.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Jenkins versions 2.251 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.235.3 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Jenkins version 2.252, and LTS 2.235.4.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the remote address is properly escaped before being displayed, preventing the execution of injected scripts.
