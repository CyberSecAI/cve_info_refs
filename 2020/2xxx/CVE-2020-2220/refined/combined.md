SECURITY-1868 / CVE-2020-2220
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
agent name on build time trend pages. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure
permission.

SECURITY-1901 / CVE-2020-2221
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1902 / CVE-2020-2222
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the job
name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip. This results in a
stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able
to configure job names.

As job names do not generally support the character set needed for XSS,
this is believed to be difficult to exploit in common configurations.

SECURITY-1945 / CVE-2020-2223
Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the
`href` attribute of links to downstream jobs displayed in the build console
page. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1924 / CVE-2020-2224
Matrix Project Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not escape node names shown in
tooltips on the overview page of builds with a single axis. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
Agent/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1925 / CVE-2020-2225
Matrix Project Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not escape the axis names shown
in tooltips on the overview page of builds with multiple axes. This results
in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users
with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1909 / CVE-2020-2226
Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin 2.6.1 and earlier does not escape user
names shown in the permission table. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability. When using project-based matrix
authorization, this vulnerability can be exploited by a user with
Job/Configure or Agent/Configure permission, otherwise by users with
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1915 / CVE-2020-2227
Deployer Framework Plugin is a framework plugin allowing other plugins to
provide a way to deploy artifacts. Deployer Framework Plugin 1.2 and
earlier does not escape the URL displayed in the build home page. This
results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide the location.

The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specific
implementation using Deployer Framework Plugin. The Jenkins security team
is not aware of any exploitable implementation.

SECURITY-1792 / CVE-2020-2228
Gitlab Authentication Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not differentiate between
user names and hierarchical group names when performing authorization. This
allows an attacker with permissions to create groups in GitLab to gain the
privileges granted to another user or group.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

# Matrix Project

How to install

* [Documentation](/matrix-project/)
* [Releases](/matrix-project/releases/)
* [Issues](/matrix-project/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/matrix-project/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/matrix-project/healthscore/)

In the New Item user interface, this plugin contributes the following one: [![Muti-configuration Project](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/matrix-project-plugin@master/doc/images/multi-configuration-project.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-project-plugin/blob/master/doc/images/multi-configuration-project.png)

## Multi-Configuration Projects

A multi-configuration project is useful for instances where your builds will make many similar build steps, and you would otherwise be duplicating steps.

## Configuration matrix

The Configuration Matrix allows you to specify what steps to duplicate, and create a multiple-axis graph of the type of builds to create.

For example, let us say that we have a build that we want to create for several different targets alpha, beta, and we want to produce both debug and release outputs. With a freestyle job, we would have the following ant commands:

```
Ant: set-target-alpha debug compile
Ant: set-target-beta debug compile
Ant: set-target-gamma debug compile
Ant: set-target-alpha release compile
Ant: set-target-beta release compile
Ant: set-target-gamma release compile

```

We can reduce this to one ant target using variables:

```
Ant: $target $releasetype compile

```

And by adding two User Defined Axis in the Configuration Matrix:

Name: `target` Value: `set-target-alpha set-target-beta set-target-gamma`

Name: `releasetype` Value: `debug release`

The Names target and releasetype are exposed to the ant scripts as environment variables. The Value is a space delimited list of points to iterate through for each axis.

The immediate upshot is that if we have another release type to add (for example, debug-optimized), we can simply add the value to the releasetype user defined axis. The single change will add configuration to build the debug-optimized release type against all three values of target.

## Notes

* You have to choose "Build multi-configuration project" when creating a project, it can not be changed later. If you skip this step, you will be very confused and not get very far.
* Each configuration is akin to an individual job. It has its own build history, logs, environment, etc. The history of your multi-config job only shows you a list of configurations executed. You have to drill into each configuration to see the history and console logs.

## Executors used by a multi-configuration project

Reference: [Re: Will a multi-configuration / matrix job always use up one executor on the built-in node?](http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-users/msg/eb809fb06759d861)

A matrix build project (that uses the Agent axis) will use one additional executor on a random node to coordinate the executions on the nodes defined by the Agent axis. This executor is added as a temporary executor (also called as "flyweight task") to the node and does not use up a configured executor slot on this node (this behavior is controlled by hudson.model.Hudson.flyweightSupport). Only this "flyweight task" will be affected by the "Restrict where this project can be run" option, under Advanced Project Options. "Actual" or non-flyweight build execution can be controlled with the "Agents" axis that can be added under the project's Configuration Matrix: individual nodes and/or labels containing multiple nodes can be selected, as well as filtering axis combinations.

You can also control which nodes can run flyweight tasks, using the [Exclude flyweight tasks plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/excludeMatrixParent), or you can pin the flyweight executor to a specific node (Please look under the "advanced" option of the matrix project configuration to tie the matrix parent to a label/agent).

## Extensions

Please refer to the [list of extensions points](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/matrix-project/) of this plugin.

## Matrix Axis Extensions

### [Dynamic Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dynamic-axis)

This plugin allows you to define a matrix build axis that is dynamically populated from an environment variable:

### [Selenium Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/selenium-axis)

Creates an axis based on a local Selenium grid and also build against the SauceLabs Selenium capability at the same time. Both components rebuild before each build to take advantage of any new capabilities.

The Selenium grid uses all capabilities available and the SauceLab one a random subset, which can be configured or disabled.

### [Yaml Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yaml-axis)

Matrix project axis creation and exclusion plugin using yaml file (It's similar to .travis.yml)

### [Sauce OnDemand Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sauce-ondemand)

This plugin allows you to integrate Sauce Selenium Testing with Jenkins.

### [Matrix Groovy Execution Strategy Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-groovy-execution-strategy)

A plugin to decide the execution order and valid combinations of matrix projects.

### [Elastic Axis](https://plugins.jenkins.io/elastic-axis)

This plugin is a power up for the multi configuration jobs allowing you to configure jobs to run on all agents under a single label.

### [NodeLabel Parameter Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nodelabelparameter)

This plugin adds two new parameter types to job configuration - node and label, this allows to dynamically select the node where a job/project should be executed.

If your plug-in is not listed here, please file a PR for the README file.
