Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2220:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of the agent name on build time trend pages within Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application (Jenkins in this case) and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the agent name. When a user views the build time trend page, this script would be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (like credentials, API keys)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user within the Jenkins application

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Agent Name:** The agent name, which is not properly escaped, is the attack vector. An attacker would need to configure a Jenkins agent with a malicious name containing the XSS payload.
- **Build Time Trend Page:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the build time trend page containing the maliciously crafted agent name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Agent/Configure Permission:** The attacker needs to have the "Agent/Configure" permission within Jenkins to be able to configure agent names. This is crucial as it allows the attacker to set a malicious agent name which will then be reflected on the build time trend page, thus triggering the XSS.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Jenkins versions 2.244 and earlier, as well as LTS versions 2.235.1 and earlier are affected.
- **Fixed Versions:** Jenkins versions 2.245 and LTS 2.235.2 include the fix for this vulnerability by escaping the agent name.
- The provided information also includes a CVSS score of High (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), further emphasizing the severity of this vulnerability.
