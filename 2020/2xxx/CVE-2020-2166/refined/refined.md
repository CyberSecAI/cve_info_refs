Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2166:

**CVE-2020-2166**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin, in versions 1.40 and earlier, uses a YAML parser that is not configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This means that when processing YAML input, the parser could create objects based on the YAML structure, potentially including malicious code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is the insecure deserialization of YAML data, allowing an attacker to control which objects are created.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting malicious YAML input, an attacker can cause the plugin to instantiate arbitrary types which can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the Jenkins server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **YAML Input:** The primary attack vector is through the provision of malicious YAML files as input to build steps within the Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Jenkins User with Job Configuration Access:** The attacker needs to be a Jenkins user with the ability to configure jobs that use the Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin. This access is necessary to provide malicious YAML input to the vulnerable build step.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin prior to version 1.41 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability stems from the pluginâ€™s use of a YAML parser that does not properly restrict the types of objects it can create. An attacker with job configuration privileges could exploit this by injecting malicious YAML input into a pipeline.
