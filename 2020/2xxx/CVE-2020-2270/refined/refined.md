Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ClearCase Release Plugin does not properly sanitize the composite baseline data before displaying it in a badge tooltip.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to escape the composite baseline in the badge tooltip. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted composite baseline: An attacker with the ability to configure a job can insert malicious javascript into the composite baseline value, which is later displayed in the tooltips.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Job/Configure permission: An attacker must have the 'Job/Configure' permission to modify the job configuration that includes the malicious composite baseline data in the ClearCase Release Plugin configuration.
