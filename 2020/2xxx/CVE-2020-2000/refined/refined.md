Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2000:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of improper input validation, OS command injection, and a stack-based buffer overflow within the PAN-OS management web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-20 Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate user inputs before processing them.
*   **CWE-78 OS Command Injection:**  The system allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands through the web interface.
*   **CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the web interface, likely triggered by malicious inputs that exceed the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an authenticated administrator to:
*   Disrupt system processes.
*   Execute arbitrary code.
*   Execute OS commands with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is **NETWORK**, indicating that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the network.
*   The attack is performed via the PAN-OS management web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an **authenticated administrator** to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack complexity is **LOW**.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue in the wild.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **HIGH** severity, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2.
*   Mitigation is possible by enabling threat signatures and following best practices for securing the management interface.
*   The vulnerability has been internally discovered by Palo Alto Networks security review.
