Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2259:

**CVE-2020-2259:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `computer-queue-plugin` Plugin does not properly sanitize agent names before displaying them in tooltips.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to escape the agent names in tooltips, allowing for injection of malicious code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or modifying displayed content.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to configure the agent name to contain malicious JavaScript. When another user hovers over this name, the code is executed within their browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the `Agent/Configure` permission to configure the name of an agent and inject malicious code.

**Summary of CVE-2020-2259:**
The `computer-queue-plugin` plugin is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack because it does not sanitize the agent names when displaying them in tooltips, allowing a malicious actor with `Agent/Configure` permission to inject and execute arbitrary javascript.
