**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The useMango Runner Plugin does not properly escape values received from the useMango service in form validation messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize data received from the `useMango` service before displaying it in form validation endpoints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Jenkins UI, which would be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the form validation output. This could lead to various malicious activities like stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through form validation endpoints of the useMango Runner Plugin. An attacker needs to control the values returned by the `useMango` service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the values returned from the `useMango` service. The user needs to view the form validation output.
