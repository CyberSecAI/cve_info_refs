Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-04-07/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:

SECURITY-1699 / CVE-2020-2172
Code Coverage API Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user
able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report"
post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external
entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side
request forgery.

SECURITY-1633 / CVE-2020-2173
Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that
bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins
1.641 and 1.625.3. This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

SECURITY-1769 / CVE-2020-2174
AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values
printed as part of form validation output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1801 / CVE-2020-2175
FitNesse Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents
before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the
plugin.

SECURITY-1780 / CVE-2020-2176
Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and
earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Code Coverage Plugin

**SECURITY-1699
/
CVE-2020-2172**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`code-coverage-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api)**

**Description:**

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This allows a user able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.5 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### XSS vulnerability in Gatling Plugin

**SECURITY-1633
/
CVE-2020-2173**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gatling`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gatling)**

**Description:**

Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3.
This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

Gatling Plugin 1.3.0 no longer allows viewing Gatling reports directly in Jenkins.
Instead users need to download an archive containing the report.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in AWSEB Deployment Plugin

**SECURITY-1769
/
CVE-2020-2174**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`awseb-deployment-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/awseb-deployment-plugin)**

**Description:**

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values printed as part of form validation output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.20 escapes the values printed as part of the affected form validation endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in FitNesse Plugin

**SECURITY-1801
/
CVE-2020-2175**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fitnesse`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fitnesse)**

**Description:**

FitNesse Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the plugin.

FitNesse Plugin 1.33 escapes content from XML input files before rendering it on the Jenkins UI.

### XSS vulnerability in useMango Runner Plugin

**SECURITY-1780
/
CVE-2020-2176**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`usemango-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/usemango-runner)**

**Description:**

Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

useMango Runner Plugin 1.5 escapes all values received from the useMango service in form validation messages.

## Severity
