### Description

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS management web interface. A remote attacker able to convince an administrator with an active authenticated session on the firewall management interface to click on a crafted link to that management web interface could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the administrator's browser and perform administrative actions.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.16;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | None | >= 10.0.0 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | None | >= 9.1.0 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.9 | >= 9.0.9 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.16 | >= 8.1.16 |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

Palo Alto Networks is aware of publicly available information that may help construct proof of concept exploits for these issues.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-79 Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.16, PAN-OS 9.0.9, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Until PAN-OS software is upgraded to a fixed version, enabling signatures for Unique Threat ID 59968 on traffic destined for the GlobalProtect portal, gateway, or VPN will block attacks against CVE-2020-2036.

Administrators should use caution when they are authenticated to the firewall management web interface and not click or open links from unsolicited sources.

This issue impacts the management web interface of PAN-OS. You can mitigate the impact of this issue by following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management web interface.

Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices>.
