Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2275:

**CVE-2020-2275**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Copy data to workspace Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin allows users to copy files from the Jenkins controller to job workspaces but lacks restrictions on which directories can be copied.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Path traversal, arbitrary file read.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Job/Configure permission can read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By configuring a job to copy files from arbitrary locations on the Jenkins controller to the job workspace.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs Job/Configure permission to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary**

The Copy data to workspace Plugin allows users to copy files from the Jenkins controller to job workspaces. However, it doesn't validate the source directory, enabling an attacker with `Job/Configure` permissions to read any file on the Jenkins controller by specifying its path as the source.
