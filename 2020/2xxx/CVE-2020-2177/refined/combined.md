SECURITY-1556 / CVE-2020-2177
Copr Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. These credentials can be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-1753 / CVE-2020-2178
Parasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.3 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user
able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have
Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1825 / CVE-2020-2179
Yaml Axis Plugin 0.2.0 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a
multi-configuration (Matrix) job, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.

SECURITY-1736 / CVE-2020-2180
AWS SAM Plugin 1.2.2 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a job
or control the contents of a previously configured "AWS SAM deploy
application" build step's YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or
equivalent) file.

## Descriptions

### Credentials stored in plain text by Copr Plugin

**SECURITY-1556
/
CVE-2020-2177**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copr)**

**Description:**

Copr Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Copr Plugin 0.6.1 stores these credentials encrypted.
This change is effective once the job configuration is saved the next time.

### XXE vulnerability in Parasoft Findings Plugin

**SECURITY-1753
/
CVE-2020-2178**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

The Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins allows you to visualize static analysis, test, and code coverage results, including support for quality gates, in Jenkins. It converts XML reports generated by Parasoft products into trend graphs and enables you to conveniently view the details or easily navigate to rule documentation. The plugin can be used with Freestyle, Maven, and Pipeline jobs.

The plugin can consume the following report types:

* Functional test reports generated by Parasoft SOAtest 2020.1+.
* Static analysis, metrics analysis, unit test and code coverage reports generated by 2020.2+ versions of C/C++test, Jtest, and dotTest.

Since 10.4.2 this plugin has been integrated with the [Warnings Next Generation Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Warnings%2BNext%2BGeneration%2BPlugin) to visualize static analysis results. Make a copy of all your job configuration settings prior to upgrading from a previous version of the Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins. All settings from previous versions, such as the location of the report.xml files, will be lost after upgrading. You will need to re-apply your configuration settings after the upgrade.

## Usage

### 1. Add yaml file to repository

example

```
# axis.yml
RUBY_VERSION:
  - 2.1.8
  - 2.2.4
  - 2.3.0

exclude:
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.1.8
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.3.0
    DATABASE: oracle
```

### 2. Create Multi-configuration project

[![new_job](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/new_job.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/new_job.png)

### 3. Configuration Axis

Choose **Yaml Axis**

[![Add axis](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/add_axis.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/add_axis.png)

Input configurations

[![config](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/axis_config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/axis_config.png)

* **Axis yaml file** : Yaml file path (relative path from workspace or absolute path)
* **Axis name** : Top key in yaml file

You can combine **Yaml Axis** and other axes

### 4. Configuration Execution Strategy

#### Choose "Yaml matrix execution strategy" at Execution Strategy

[![strategy](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/execution_strategy.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/execution_strategy.png)

If you don't want to exclusion, choose **Classic**

#### Input settings

##### Example 1 (Use yaml file)

[![yaml_file](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/yaml_file.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/yaml_file.png)

##### Example 2 (Use yaml text)

[![yaml_text](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/yaml_text.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/yaml_text.png)

### 4. Build job

Generate yaml based matrix and run job 💪

[![result](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/result.png)

* blue is executed job
* gray is excluded(skipped) job

## Detail

### Excluding logic

Excluding pattern may be specified with `List` of `Map` (e.g. `List<Map<String, [String or List]>>`)

Elements in the `Map` may be a List to exclude multiple items for one key

```
# axis.yml
exclude:
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.1.8
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.3.0
    DATABASE: oracle
```

When specified 2 axes

[![axis](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/axis.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/axis.png)

This results in a 3x3 build matrix.

[![result](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin@master/doc/result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/yaml-axis-plugin/blob/master/doc/result.png)

* When specified `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8`, 3 results are excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `mysql` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `postgres` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded
* When specified `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `oracle`, 1 result is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded

#### Another example

```
# axis2.yml
exclude:
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.1.8
  - RUBY_VERSION: 2.3.0
    DATABASE:
      - oracle
      - mysql
```

* When specified `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8`, 3 results are excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `mysql` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `postgres` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded
* When specified `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0`, 2 results are excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `mysql` is excluded

#### Final example

Using multiple lists will exclude the cartesian product of those lists.

```
# axis3.yml
exclude:
  - RUBY_VERSION:
      - 2.1.8
      - 2.3.0
    DATABASE:
      - oracle
      - mysql
```

* 4 results are excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `mysql` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.1.8` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `oracle` is excluded
  + `RUBY_VERSION` value `2.3.0` and `DATABASE` value `mysql` is excluded

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
