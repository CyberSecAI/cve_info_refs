Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2215:

**CVE-2020-2215:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation, and does not require POST requests for this form validation, leading to CSRF vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a method that performs form validation. This allows any user with Overall/Read access to trigger the validation.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method can be triggered via GET requests, thus vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can connect to an attacker-controlled host with attacker-specified username and password. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or other malicious actions by leveraging the connection to the attacker-controlled host

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** An attacker who has Overall/Read permissions to Jenkins can trigger the vulnerable validation method.
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious link or web page that, when accessed by a logged-in Jenkins user, will cause the victim's browser to send a request to Jenkins, effectively performing the form validation using the attacker's specified parameters and credentials.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious link or webpage.
