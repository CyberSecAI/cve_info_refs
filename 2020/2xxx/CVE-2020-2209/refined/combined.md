## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Sonargraph Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1775
/
CVE-2020-2201**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sonargraph-integration`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonargraph-integration)**

**Description:**

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin

**SECURITY-1690
/
CVE-2020-2202**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Fortify on Demand Plugin

**SECURITY-1691
/
CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This form validation method requires appropriate permission in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in VncRecorder Plugin

VncRecorder Plugin 1.35 escapes the tool path.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in VncRecorder Plugin

**SECURITY-1728 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2206**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vncrecorder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vncrecorder)**

**Description:**

VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

VncRecorder Plugin 1.35 escapes the parameter value in the output.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in VncViewer Plugin

**SECURITY-1776
/
CVE-2020-2207**

[`slack-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack-uploader)**

**Description:**

Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This secret can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Password stored in plain text by TestComplete support Plugin

**SECURITY-1686
/
CVE-2020-2209**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`TestComplete`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/TestComplete)**

**Description:**

### Passwords transmitted in plain text by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin

**SECURITY-1656
/
CVE-2020-2210**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`StashBranchParameter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/StashBranchParameter)**

**Description:**

Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin 0.3.0 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### RCE vulnerability in ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin

**SECURITY-1738
/
CVE-2020-2211**

**Severity (CVSS):**

[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-coverage-reporter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-coverage-reporter)**

**Description:**

GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin 1.8 and earlier stores a GitHub access token in plain text in its global configuration file `io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`.
This token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Credentials stored in plain text by whitesource Plugin

**SECURITY-1630
/
CVE-2020-2213**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`whitesource`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/whitesource)**

**Description:**

whitesource Plugin 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as part of its global configuration file `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by ZAP Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1811
/
CVE-2020-2214**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zap-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zap-pipeline)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) configured are largely unaffected.
A possible exception are file parameter downloads.
The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:

* Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.
* Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.
* Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, donâ€™t have XSS protection for file parameter values, see [SECURITY-1793](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin

**SECURITY-1762
/
CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zephyr-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zephyr-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Reflected XSS in Compatibility Action Storage Plugin

**SECURITY-1771
/
CVE-2020-2217**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compatibility-action-storage`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compatibility-action-storage)**

**Description:**

Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation endpoint.
This allows attackers able to update the configured document in MongoDB to inject the payload.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## *About*

A SmartBear plugin for running TestComplete tests from Jenkins.

The plugin provides a build step that lets you include your TestComplete tests in your Jenkins freestyle jobs and Pipelines. In addition, the plugin keeps a list of test runs and lets you view test results directly from Jenkins.

## *Prepare Nodes*

Prepare a test computer (node) for automated testing. Make sure the node has everything it needs to run tests successfully:

* TestComplete or TestExecute is installed on them.
* The required browsers and applications are installed on the nodes.
* TestComplete project files are copied to your node workspace.
* The required test data files and other helper files reside on the nodes.
* If you have a desktop tested application, make sure the application is installed on the nodes before running TestComplete tests.

  To copy files to the nodes, you can, for example, use the Folder Copy operation of theÂ [File Operations Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/file-operations/).

## *Usage*

* Freestyle Jobs
* Pipeline
* View Test Results

### *Freestyle Jobs*

To run your TestComplete tests as part of a Jenkins job:

1. Add the TestComplete Test step to your Jenkins job.
2. Configure the step:
   * Select the test runner: TestComplete or TestExecute.
   * Specify the TestComplete project suite file and select tests to be run.
   * Important: Select the **Run interactive user session** check box, if needed (see below), and specify additional parameters for the run.
3. Run the build as you normally would.

### *Pipeline*

*To run your TestComplete tests as part of a Jenkins Pipeline:*

1. Add code that will run your TestComplete tests to your Pipeline script (Jenkinsfile).
2. To generate the needed code, you can use the built-in Jenkins Snippet Generator utility:
   * Click the **Pipeline Syntax** link in the **Pipeline** section of your project.
   * In the **Sample Step** drop-down list, select testcompletetest: TestComplete Test.
   * Configure the step as described in the instruction for freestyle jobs above (select a test runner, specify a project suite and tests to run, and so on).
   * Click **Generate Pipeline Script**. Copy the generated code and then paste it to your Pipeline script.
3. Run your Pipeline as you normally would.

### *View Test Results*

After your build run is over, you can see the TestComplete Test Results link on the build page. Click the link to view test results. In the subsequent screen, click the link in the Test column to explore detailed test results.

#### Important

Your test nodes must **run an interactive user session**. Otherwise, TestComplete (or TestExecute) will be unable to interact with the UI of the application under test.

To create an interactive user session:

* If you use TestComplete 10.6 or later, we recommend that you enable the **Run interactive user session** option of the TestComplete Test step (if you use Pipeline, set the useTCService parameter of the step to true).
* If you unable to use this approach for some reason, then an alternative to run an interactive user session is to launch the node and control it via Java Web Start.

## *More Information*

You can find complete information on using the plugin in [**TestComplete documentation**](http://support.smartbear.com/viewarticle/64394/).

## *Technical Support*

If you have any questions or need assistance with setting up the plugin and configuring the stepâ€™s properties, please [contact the SmartBear Support Team](http://support.smartbear.com/message/?prod=TestComplete).

SECURITY-1775 / CVE-2020-2201
Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file
path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1690 / CVE-2020-2202
Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to
allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on
Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read
permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as
part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1691 / CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)
Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured
Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1728 (1) / CVE-2020-2205
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration
forms.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

SECURITY-1728 (2) / CVE-2020-2206
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in
the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1776 / CVE-2020-2207
VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1627 / CVE-2020-2208
Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1686 / CVE-2020-2209
TestComplete support Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted
in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This password can
be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master
file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1656 / CVE-2020-2210
Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global
configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
0.3.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1738 / CVE-2020-2211
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not
configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide YAML input files to ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes
CI/CD Plugin's build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1632 / CVE-2020-2212
GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin 1.8 and earlier stores a GitHub access
token in plain text in its global configuration file
`io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`. This can be viewed by
users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1630 / CVE-2020-2213
White Source Plugin 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as
part of its global configuration file
`org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml`
files) or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1811 / CVE-2020-2214
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins. This
allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to
control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1762 / CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)
Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1771 / CVE-2020-2217
Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the
content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation
endpoint. This allows attackers able to update the configured document in
MongoDB to inject the payload.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1576 / CVE-2020-2218
HP ALM Quality Center Plugin 1.6 and earlier stores a password in plain
text in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.qc.QualityCenterIntegrationRecorder.xml`. This
password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file
system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1803 / CVE-2020-2219
Link Column Plugin allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new
column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.

Link Column Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links,
allowing the `javascript:` scheme. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list
views.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
