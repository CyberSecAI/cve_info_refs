Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2129:

**CVE-2020-2129**

*   **Root Cause:** The Eagle Tester Plugin stores a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.

*   **Weakness:**  The plugin stores sensitive information (password) in plain text.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker with access to the Jenkins master file system can view the unencrypted password. This may lead to unauthorized access to the Eagle Tester service, if the password grants access.

*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker would need direct access to the Jenkins master's file system.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have access to the file system of the Jenkins controller. This could potentially be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities or through compromised administrator accounts.

**Summary**

The Eagle Tester plugin stores a password in plain text on the Jenkins master's file system. This is a vulnerability since it exposes sensitive information to anyone who can access the server's file system.
