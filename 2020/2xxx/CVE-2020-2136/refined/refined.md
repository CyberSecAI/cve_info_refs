Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2136:

**CVE Description:**

Git Plugin 4.2.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL for Microsoft TFS field form validation. This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper output sanitization/escaping of the error message related to the repository URL when using the Microsoft TFS field form validation in the Git plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the application (Jenkins) and executed when other users view the affected area.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who access the job configuration page.
- **Account Takeover:** Depending on the injected script, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate the Jenkins interface or inject malicious content into the UI.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Form field injection:** The attacker needs to insert a malicious payload into the repository URL field when configuring a job that is using Microsoft TFS. Specifically, the error message triggered by the form validation logic for Microsoft TFS will be stored without being properly escaped.
- **User Access:** A user with "Job/Configure" permission can inject the malicious payload.
- **User Interaction:** Other users who access the job configuration page for the job where the payload was added will have the malicious JavaScript code executed in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have "Job/Configure" permission for at least one job.
- They need to be able to manipulate the repository URL for Microsoft TFS setting.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specifically related to the form validation for Microsoft TFS repository URLs.
- Git Plugin 4.2.1 fixes this issue by properly escaping the affected part of the error message.
