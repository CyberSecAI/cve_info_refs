Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-2285:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Liquibase Runner Plugin, versions 1.4.7 and earlier, lacks a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   Missing permission check. Specifically, there's no authorization check to verify if a user is allowed to access the affected endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can enumerate the IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. This allows the attacker to gain knowledge of the existence and identifiers of secrets managed by Jenkins. Although the credentials themselves are not directly exposed, this information can be used as part of a larger attack to capture the actual credentials by exploiting other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed via an HTTP endpoint lacking proper permission checks.
*   The attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins. This is a relatively low level of privilege, making the vulnerability easier to exploit.
* The attacker needs to make a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified as SECURITY-2030 within the Jenkins project.
*   The fix is implemented in Liquibase Runner Plugin version 1.4.8, which introduces the necessary permission checks.
*   This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities disclosed on the same day, with multiple plugins being affected.
