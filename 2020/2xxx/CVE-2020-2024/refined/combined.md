## Description

![@bergwolf](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88972?u=08d58cb4c57a46ea2ce5d0da4aed3f0dc98dcca3&v=4&size=48)[bergwolf](https://github.com/bergwolf)opened [on Feb 19, 2020](https://github.com/kata-containers/runtime/issues/2474#issue-567548955)
# Description of problem

A container's host path might be changed by the guest to point to some other places by placing a symlink there. kata runtime should not follow link when unmounting them otherwise we might end up unmounting some other mountpoints unexpectedly.
