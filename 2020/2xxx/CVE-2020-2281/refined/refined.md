Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2281:

**CVE-2020-2281**

*   **Root Cause:** The Lockable Resources Plugin did not require POST requests for certain HTTP endpoints. This lack of enforcement enables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin's HTTP endpoints for managing resources (reserve, unreserve, unlock, reset) were vulnerable to CSRF attacks due to the absence of POST request validation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:
    *   Reserve resources
    *   Unreserve resources
    *   Unlock resources
    *   Reset resources
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user, would send unauthorized requests to the vulnerable endpoints, leading to unintended resource management actions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need direct access to the Jenkins instance, but requires a logged-in Jenkins user to visit a malicious site or open a malicious link.

**Summary:**
The Lockable Resources Plugin had a CSRF vulnerability because it did not require POST requests for certain sensitive operations. An attacker could exploit this to manipulate resources by tricking an authenticated Jenkins user to unknowingly make changes.
