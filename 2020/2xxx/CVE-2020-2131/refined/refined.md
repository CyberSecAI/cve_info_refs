Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2131:

**CVE-2020-2131**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Harvest SCM Plugin stores SCM passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. This is due to a lack of encryption or proper handling of sensitive data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of SCM passwords in plain text within job configuration files (`config.xml`).
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers can gain access to SCM passwords, potentially allowing them to access source code repositories and other systems that rely on those credentials.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised credentials could potentially be used for further attacks on systems accessible through these credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Direct File System Access:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins master's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files and obtain the unencrypted passwords.
    *  **Extended Read Permission:** Users with "Extended Read" permission on Jenkins jobs are also able to read job `config.xml` files and obtain the unencrypted passwords.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs either:
        *   Direct access to the Jenkins master file system.
        *   Extended Read permission for the affected jobs within Jenkins.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content indicates that there is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   CVE-2020-2130 is related to the global configuration of the same plugin, also storing passwords unencrypted, while this CVE (CVE-2020-2131) affects the job configurations.
