Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin fails to properly escape the error message associated with the repository URL field during form validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin doesn't sanitize the error message, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error output. This could be exploited similar to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a user's browser session when they encounter the error message. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the form validation for the repository URL field.
- The attacker needs to provide an input that triggers the error message with malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to cause the error to display to another user.
- An attacker would need the ability to craft a malicious input, and the vulnerability is exploitable by users with `Job/Configure` permission.
- The attacker does not have to be authenticated, but the victim does.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin version 1.0.1 and earlier.
- At the time of the advisory publication, there was no fix available for this vulnerability.
