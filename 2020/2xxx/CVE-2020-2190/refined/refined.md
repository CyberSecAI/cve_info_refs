Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Script Security Plugin, in versions 1.72 and earlier, fails to properly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the "In-process Script Approval" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient output sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the classpath entries displayed on the "In-process Script Approval" page.
- Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session when the "In-process Script Approval" page is viewed, potentially leading to actions being performed on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to configure sandboxed scripts, meaning they must have sufficient permissions within the Jenkins environment.
- The attacker injects malicious code within classpath entries.
- When an authorized user views the "In-process Script Approval" page, the injected script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires "configure sandboxed scripts" privileges. This means the attacker needs at least Job/Configure level permissions within Jenkins or equivalent to create or modify jobs.
- The attacker needs to be able to set malicious classpath entries.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory states that Script Security Plugin 1.73 addresses the issue by properly escaping the classpath entries before rendering them in the Jenkins UI.
- The provided CVSS score indicates a medium severity level.
