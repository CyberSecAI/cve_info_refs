Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a discrepancy in how Jenkins handled URL paths when deciding whether to apply Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. An extension point in Jenkins allows disabling CSRF protection for specific URLs. The implementation of this extension point was receiving a different representation of the URL path compared to how the Stapler web framework was handling it. This inconsistency allowed attackers to bypass CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Bypass:** The core vulnerability is a bypass of the CSRF protection mechanism.
*   **Inconsistent URL Path Handling:** The vulnerability resulted from inconsistent handling of URL paths between the CSRF protection mechanism and the Stapler web framework, which is responsible for request dispatching in Jenkins.
*   **Missing Semicolon Restriction:** Semicolons in the path part of a URL were not being restricted which could be leveraged for exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass CSRF protection for any target URL.
*   CSRF vulnerabilities can have a wide range of impacts, including unauthorized modification of data, and unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of legitimate users.
* The impact can be severe, as it would allow an attacker to execute actions with the privileges of a logged-in victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers could craft URLs that exploit the discrepancy in URL path representations.
*   **User Interaction:** Typically, a CSRF attack requires some form of user interaction, such as tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into interacting with the crafted URL. The user needs to be logged in to the Jenkins instance.
*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker doesn't need to have a Jenkins account to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides a system property `hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.UNPROCESSED_PATHINFO` to revert to the old behavior if needed.
*   It also mentions that the system property `jenkins.security.SuspiciousRequestFilter.allowSemicolonsInPath` can be used to allow semicolons in URLs.
*   The vulnerability is present in Jenkins versions 2.227 and earlier, and LTS versions 2.204.5 and earlier.
