# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1774 / CVE-2020-2160
An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.

Implementations of that extension point received a different representation
of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier. This discrepancy
allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of
any target URL.

SECURITY-1781 / CVE-2020-2161
Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes. These
labels can be referenced in job configurations to restrict where a job can
be run.

In Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, the form validation
for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape
label names, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to define node labels.

SECURITY-1793 / CVE-2020-2162
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier served files uploaded as
file parameters to a build without specifying appropriate
`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers. This resulted in a stored
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with
permissions to build a job with file parameters.

SECURITY-1796 / CVE-2020-2163
Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier processed HTML embedded
in list view column headers. This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the content of
column headers.

The following plugins are known to allow users to define column headers:

* Warnings NG
* Maven Info
* Link Column

Further plugins may also allow users to define column headers.

SECURITY-1542 (1) / CVE-2020-2164
Artifactory Plugin 3.5.0 and earlier stores its Artifactory server password
in plain text in the global configuration file
`org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml`. This password can be viewed by
users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1542 (2) / CVE-2020-2165
Artifactory Plugin stores Artifactory server passwords in its global
configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since Artifactory Plugin
3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by
Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1741 / CVE-2020-2166
Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.40 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin's build steps.

SECURITY-1739 / CVE-2020-2167
OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.56 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to OpenShift Pipeline Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1732 / CVE-2020-2168
Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not configure its
YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results
in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Azure Container Service Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1724 / CVE-2020-2169
A form validation HTTP endpoint in Queue cleanup Plugin 1.3 and earlier
does not escape a query parameter displayed in an error message. This
results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

SECURITY-1676 / CVE-2020-2170
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not escape package names in its
displayed table of packages obtained from a remote server. This results in
a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able
to configure jobs.

SECURITY-1677 / CVE-2020-2171
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'RapidDeploy
deployment package build' build or post-build step to have Jenkins parse a
crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the
Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

| --- | --- |

## Steps and actions

### ***RapidDeploy project deployment***

Invokes a project deployment on a *RapidDeploy* server as either a build step or a post-build action. Multiple deployments can be executed sequentially or in parallel. You can check the result and the process logs in the *Jenkins* build output.

**This task can be used with *RapidDeploy* 3.3.23 or higher.**

#### Parameters

* ***RapidDeploy* server URL**: the URL to the *RapidDeploy* server you want to connect to, including the protocol (e.g.: <http://192.168.1.1:8090/MidVision>).
* ***RapidDeploy* authentication token**: the authentication token used to connect to the *RapidDeploy* server. It can be generated by the [*MidVision* encrypter tool](http://docs.midvision.com/LATEST/reference/tools/web-service-encrypter.html).
* ***RapidDeploy* project name**: the name of the *RapidDeploy* project you want to deploy.
* ***RapidDeploy* project target name**: the *RapidDeploy* project target to deploy to (i.e.: SERVER.INSTALLATION.CONFIGURATION).
* **Deployment package name**: the name of the *RapidDeploy* deployment package to deploy. Leave this field blank or set it to "LATEST" if you want to deploy the latest package.
* **Asynchronous job**: this option allows the step to run asynchronously. The *Jenkins* job will continue to the next build step immediately once the project deployment request has been made to *RapidDeploy*. Use this option to deploy projects in parallel. **Synchronous steps are supported from RapidDeploy version 3.4.0+**.
* **Show full log**: when checking this option, you will see the entire log file of the *RapidDeploy* deployment in the *Jenkins* job output, if left unchecked, only a link to the *RapidDeploy* log file will be printed in the job output.

#### Data Dictionary

Is it possible to override the data dictionary of a *RapidDeploy* project by using the parameters of a parametrised *Jenkins* job.

In order to use this feature, the paraemter key needs to be in the same form of a *RapidDeploy* data diciontary item key, i.e., using the `@@` string as a prefix and suffix. For example:

* `@@PARAM_1@@`
* `@@param_one@@`

When you use this specific syntax, the parameter will automatically be considered a data dictionary item.

| ⚠️ | For a standard *RapidDeploy* deployment, the data dictionary is taken from inside the deployment package version we want to deploy.   When using this feature on *Jenkins*, a new temporary injected package is created to be able to override these data dictionary items.   It is important to keep this in mind, because **this means the particular deployment package version used for the deployment was altered, to override these data dictionary items, and thus it could provoke inconsistency when deploying the same deployment package version again, without these data dicionary items overridden**. |
| --- | --- |

### ***RapidDeploy deployment package creation***

Invokes a deployment package creation on a *RapidDeploy* server as either a build step or a post-build action. You can check the result and the process logs in the *Jenkins* build output.

**This task can be used with *RapidDeploy* 3.4.5 or higher. When using the version 3.7 or higher of the plugin it is required to target a *RapidDeploy* version 4.0 or above.**

#### Parameters

* ***RapidDeploy* server URL**: the URL to the *RapidDeploy* server you want to connect to, including the protocol (e.g.: <http://192.168.1.1:8090/MidVision>).
* ***RapidDeploy* authentication token**: the authentication token used to connect to the *RapidDeploy* server. It can be generated by the [*MidVision* encrypter tool](http://docs.midvision.com/LATEST/reference/tools/web-service-encrypter.html).
* ***RapidDeploy* project name**: the name of the *RapidDeploy* project for which you want to create a new deployment package.
* **Package name**: the name of the *RapidDeploy* deployment package you are creating. If not provided, an automatic version incremental name will be used based on the latest package name.
* **Archive extension**: the extension of the deployment package file to generate: *jar, war, ear, tar, rar* or *zip*. It defaults to *jar*.

### ***RapidDeploy job plan runner***

Invokes a job plan run on a *RapidDeploy* server as either a build step or a post-build action. Multiple job plans can be executed sequentially or in parallel. You can check the result and the process logs in the *Jenkins* build output.

**This task can be used with RapidDeploy 3.3.23 or higher.**

#### Parameters

* ***RapidDeploy* server URL**: the URL to the *RapidDeploy* server you want to connect to, including the protocol (e.g.: <http://192.168.1.1:8090/MidVision>).
* ***RapidDeploy* authentication token**: the authentication token used to connect to the *RapidDeploy* server. It can be generated by the [*MidVision* encrypter tool](http://docs.midvision.com/LATEST/reference/tools/web-service-encrypter.html).
* ***RapidDeploy* job plan**: the ID of the *RapidDeploy* job plan you want to run.
* **Asynchronous job**: this option allows the step to run asynchronously. The *Jenkins* job will continue to the next build step immediately once the job plan run request has been made to *RapidDeploy.* Use this option to run job plans in parallel. **Synchronous steps are supported from RapidDeploy version 3.4.0+**.
* **Show individual logs**: this option allows the user to see the logs of all the individual project deployments included in the job plan.
* **Show full log**: when checking this option, you will see the entire log file of the *RapidDeploy* job plan execution in the *Jenkins* job output, if left unchecked, only a link to the *RapidDeploy* log file will be printed in the job output.

## Descriptions

### CSRF protection for any URL could be bypassed

**SECURITY-1774
/
CVE-2020-2160**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.

Implementations of that extension point received a different representation of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier.
This discrepancy allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

Jenkins now uses the same representation of the URL path to decide whether CSRF protection is needed for a given URL as the Stapler web framework uses.

|  | In case of problems, administrators can disable this security fix by setting the system property `hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.UNPROCESSED_PATHINFO` to `true`. |
| --- | --- |

|  | As an additional safeguard, semicolon (`;`) characters in the path part of a URL are now banned by default. Administrators can disable this protection by setting the system property `jenkins.security.SuspiciousRequestFilter.allowSemicolonsInPath` to `true`. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in label expression validation

**SECURITY-1781
/
CVE-2020-2161**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes.
These labels can be referenced in job configurations to restrict where a job can be run.

In Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, the form validation for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape label names, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to define node labels.

Jenkins now correctly escapes node labels that are shown in form validation on job configuration pages.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in file parameters

**SECURITY-1793
/
CVE-2020-2162**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier served files uploaded as file parameters to a build without specifying appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers.
This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with permissions to build a job with file parameters.

Jenkins now sets `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers when serving files uploaded via a file parameter to the same value as used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts not served using the Resource Root URL.

The system property `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP` can be set to override the value of `Content-Security-Policy` headers sent when serving these files.
This is the same system property used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts unless those are served via the [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) and works the same way for file parameters.
See [Configuring Content Security Policy](/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy) to learn more.

|  | Even when Jenkins is configured to serve files in workspaces and archived artifacts using the Resource Root URL (introduced in Jenkins 2.200), file parameters are not, and therefore still subject to `Content-Security-Policy` restrictions. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in list view column headers

**SECURITY-1796
/
CVE-2020-2163**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier processed HTML embedded in list view column headers.
This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the content of column headers.

The following plugins are known to allow users to define column headers:

* [Warnings NG](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/)
* [Maven Info](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-info/)
* [Link Column](https://plugins.jenkins.io/link-column/)

Further plugins may also allow users to define column headers.

Jenkins no longer processes HTML embedded in list view column headers.

### Passwords stored in plain text by Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1542 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2164**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin 3.5.0 and earlier stores its Artifactory server password in plain text in the global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml`.
This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 now stores the Artifactory server password encrypted.
This change is effective once the global configuration is saved the next time.

### Passwords transmitted in plain text by Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1542 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2165**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin stores Artifactory server passwords in its global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Artifactory Plugin 3.6.1 transmits the password in its global configuration encrypted.

### RCE vulnerability in Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin

**SECURITY-1741
/
CVE-2020-2166**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-aws`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-aws)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.40 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin’s build steps.

Pipeline: AWS Steps Plugin 1.41 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### RCE vulnerability in OpenShift Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1739
/
CVE-2020-2167**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`openshift-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/openshift-pipeline)**

**Description:**

OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.56 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to OpenShift Pipeline Plugin’s build step.

OpenShift Pipeline Plugin 1.0.57 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### RCE vulnerability in Azure Container Service Plugin

**SECURITY-1732
/
CVE-2020-2168**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-acs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-acs)**

**Description:**

Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to Azure Container Service Plugin’s build step.

Azure Container Service Plugin 1.0.2 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Queue cleanup Plugin

**SECURITY-1724
/
CVE-2020-2169**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`queue-cleanup`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/queue-cleanup)**

**Description:**

A form validation HTTP endpoint in Queue cleanup Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not escape a query parameter displayed in an error message.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

Queue cleanup Plugin 1.4 correctly escapes the query parameter.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in RapidDeploy Plugin

**SECURITY-1676
/
CVE-2020-2170**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`rapiddeploy-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rapiddeploy-jenkins)**

**Description:**

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not escape package names in its displayed table of packages obtained from a remote server.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs.

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2.1 escapes package names.

### XXE vulnerability in RapidDeploy Plugin

**SECURITY-1677
/
CVE-2020-2171**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`rapiddeploy-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rapiddeploy-jenkins)**

**Description:**

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'RapidDeploy deployment package build' build or post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

RapidDeploy Plugin 4.2.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
