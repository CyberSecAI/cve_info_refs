Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2198:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Project Inheritance Plugin does not perform permission checks on its `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` API endpoint. This allows users with only Job/Read permissions to access job configuration XML data.
- Additionally, the plugin fails to redact encrypted secret values when providing the job configuration XML data via this endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing permission check:** The plugin exposes sensitive job configuration data without proper authorization.
- **Information disclosure:** The plugin reveals unredacted encrypted secrets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users with Job/Read permission can access the full job configuration XML, including encrypted secrets.
- This allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive information which should only be available to users with higher privileges (Job/ExtendedRead, implied by Job/Configure).

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a request to the `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` API endpoint of the affected Project Inheritance Plugin to obtain the job configuration XML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Job/Read permission.
- The attacker has to be able to access the Jenkins web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content notes that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the advisory.
- The description is more detailed than the official CVE description, which is just a placeholder.
