- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing certificate validation in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app when the pre-logon feature is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)
    - Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disclose the pre-logon authentication cookie and access the GlobalProtect Server as allowed by the configured security rules for the 'pre-login' user. This access may be limited compared to regular users.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attack on the same local area network segment with the ability to manipulate ARP or conduct ARP spoofing attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same local area network segment as the victim and have the ability to manipulate ARP or conduct ARP spoofing attacks.
