Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2138:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cobertura Plugin, in versions 1.15 and earlier, does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attacks. This is due to the lack of configuration to disable external entity resolution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
  - Extract secrets from the Jenkins master.
  - Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable by a user who is able to control the input files for the 'Publish Cobertura Coverage Report' post-build step. This involves crafting a malicious XML file that uses external entities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to control the input XML files that the Cobertura plugin parses. This implies that the attacker would need to have sufficient permissions to configure a job that uses the 'Publish Cobertura Coverage Report' post-build step. This may or may not be a user with a low-privilege position.

**Additional notes:**
- Cobertura Plugin version 1.16 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser, mitigating this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability is also tracked as SECURITY-1700.
