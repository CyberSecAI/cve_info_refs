Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2168:

**CVE-2020-2168**

*   **Root Cause:** The Azure Container Service Plugin, versions 1.0.1 and earlier, uses a YAML parser that is not configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Insecure deserialization of YAML input. The plugin doesn't restrict the types that can be created when parsing YAML, allowing for the instantiation of arbitrary classes.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can leverage the ability to instantiate arbitrary types to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server.

*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can provide a malicious YAML file to a build step that uses the Azure Container Service Plugin.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to configure jobs or provide YAML input files to the Azure Container Service Plugin's build steps. This typically requires at least "Job/Build" permissions within Jenkins.
    *   The attacker does not require any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Azure Container Service Plugin's use of a YAML parser. Because the parser is not configured to restrict the instantiation of arbitrary types, a malicious user can supply a crafted YAML file that will be deserialized by the plugin, leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins server.
