Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2111:

**CVE-2020-2111**

*   **Root Cause:** The Subversion Plugin does not properly sanitize the error message for the Project Repository Base URL field during form validation.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of users who view the affected page. This could lead to various malicious actions like session hijacking, information theft, or other unauthorized activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting a malicious string in the Project Repository Base URL field. This can occur when a user configures a job, such as a Multibranch Pipeline, which uses this field.
    *   When an error is triggered, the unsanitized malicious input is displayed on the Jenkins interface, executing the XSS payload.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to specify the Project Repository Base URL, for example, having the permission to configure Multibranch Pipelines.
    *   The attacker can trigger the error message by providing an invalid value for the base URL.

**Summary**

The Subversion Plugin prior to version 2.13.1 is vulnerable to a stored XSS. An attacker who can configure the Project Repository Base URL can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed in the context of other users viewing the error message.
