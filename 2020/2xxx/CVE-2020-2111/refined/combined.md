## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass via default method parameter expression in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1710
/
CVE-2020-2109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.78 and earlier can be circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods.

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are subject to sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.79.

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1713
/
CVE-2020-2110**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.69 and earlier can be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to imports or by using them inside of other annotations.
This affects both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing sandboxed script validation.

Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

This issue is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1266](/security/advisory/2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266).

Script Security Plugin 1.70 disallows all known unsafe AST transformations on imports or when used inside of other annotations.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-1725
/
CVE-2020-2111**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`subversion`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion)**

**Description:**

Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the Project Repository Base URL field form validation.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to specify such base URLs, for example users able to configure Multibranch Pipelines.

Subversion Plugin 2.13.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

### Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in Git Parameter Plugin

**SECURITY-1709
/
CVE-2020-2112 (parameter name), CVE-2020-2113 (default value)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-parameter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-parameter)**

**Description:**

Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.11 and earlier does not correctly escape the parameter name or default value.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.12 escapes the parameter name and default value shown on the UI.

### Credential transmitted in plain text by S3 publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1684
/
CVE-2020-2114**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`s3`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/s3)**

**Description:**

S3 publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.5 transmits the secret key in its global configuration encrypted.

### XXE vulnerability in NUnit Plugin

**SECURITY-1752
/
CVE-2020-2115**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`nunit`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nunit)**

**Description:**

NUnit Plugin 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

NUnit Plugin 0.26 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin allows capturing credentials

**SECURITY-812 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check)**

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-githubnotify-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-githubnotify-step)**

**Description:**

Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.5.

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credential IDs in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin

**SECURITY-812 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2118**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-githubnotify-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-githubnotify-step)**

**Description:**

Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.5 requires the permission to configure a project.

### Client secret transmitted in plain text by Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin

**SECURITY-1717
/
CVE-2020-2119**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-ad`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-ad)**

**Description:**

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin 1.1.2 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin 1.2.0 transmits the client secret in its global configuration encrypted.

### XXE vulnerability in FitNesse Plugin

**SECURITY-1751
/
CVE-2020-2120**

[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`fitnesse`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fitnesse)**

**Description:**

FitNesse Plugin 1.30 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

FitNesse Plugin 1.31 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

### RCE vulnerability in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin

**SECURITY-1731
/
CVE-2020-2121**

This plugin adds the Subversion support (via SVNKit) to Jenkins.

# Basic Usage

Once this plugin is installed, you'll see Subversion as one of the options in the SCM section of job configurations. See inline help for more information about how to use it.

### Usage with Server Certificates

An important note for those wanting to use client certificates to authenticate to your subversion server. Your PKCS12 cert file must not have a blank passphrase or a blank export password as it will cause authentication to fail. Refer to [SVNKit:0000271](http://issues.tmatesoft.com/issue/SVNOLD-271 "SVNKit:0000271") for more details.

# Advanced Features/Configurations

## Proxy

You can set the proxy in C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/Subversion/servers (Windows) or ~/.subversion/servers (Linux)

*(Jenkins as a service on Windows : C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\servers)*

> There's a tension between doing this in Jenkins vs following the existing Subversion convention — the former has a benefit of being available on all the agents. In this case, the proxy is a system dependent setting, which might be different between different agents, so I think it makes sense to keep it in ~/.subversion/servers. (See <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4041>)

## Post-commit hook

Jenkins can poll Subversion repositories for changes, and while this is reasonably efficient, this can only happen up to every once a minute, so you may still have to wait a full minute before Jenkins detects a change.

To reduce this delay, you can set up [a post commit hook](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks) so the Subversion repository can notify Jenkins whenever a change is made to that repository. To do this, put the following script in your `post-commit` file (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory):

```
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"
UUID=`svnlook uuid $REPOS`
/usr/bin/wget \
  --header "Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8" \
  --post-data "`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS`" \
  --output-document "-" \
  --timeout=2 \
  http://server/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV

```

Notice the rev=$REV parameter, this tells Jenkins to check out exactly the revision which was reported by the hook. If your job has multiple Subversion module locations defined, this may lead to inconsistent checkouts - so it's recommended to leave out '?rev=$REV' in that case.
 You may also want to leave out the '?rev=$REV' parameter if you are using Maven to release your projects and do not want Jenkins to build the intermediate prepare-release commit (ie: the released artifacts).
 See [JENKINS-14254](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14254) for details.

Jobs on Jenkins need to be configured with the SCM polling option to benefit from this behavior. This is so that you can have some jobs that are never triggered by the post-commit hook (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory), such as release related tasks, by omitting the SCM polling option. The configured polling can have any schedule (probably infrequent like monthly or yearly). The net effect is as if polling happens out of their usual cycles.

For this to work, your Jenkins has to allow anonymous read access (specifically, "Job > Read" access) to the system. If access control to your Jenkins is more restrictive, you may need to specify the username and password, depending on how your authentication is configured.

If your Jenkins uses the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" security option, the above request will be rejected with 403 errors ("No valid crumb was included"). The crumb needed in this request can be obtained from the URL `http:``//server/crumbIssuer/api/xml` (or `/api/json`). This can be included in the wget call above with something like this:

```
--header `wget -q --output-document - \
  'http://server/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'`

```

### Considerations

Since `wget` by default retries up to **20 times** when not succeeding within the given timeout, `--timeout=2` on a slow SVN server may cause Jenkins to scan the repository many more times than needed, further slowing down the SVN Server which after a while makes Jenkins unresponsive.

Possible solutions to this problem are to increase the timeout, to add a lower maximum number of retries using the argument `--retries=3` or to make the `wget` call asynchronous (and thus ignoring any communication errors) by adding `2>&1 &` last on the `wget` call.

Having the timeout too low can also cause your commits to hang and throw either 502 errors if you are behind a proxy, or post-commit errors if not. Increasing the timeout until you no longer see wget retrying should fix the issue.

### More robust \*nix post-commit hook example

The basic script above is fine if your server does not do authentication or you have no problem providing anonymous read access to Jenkins (as well as anonymous read to all the individual jobs you want to trigger if you are using project-based matrix authorization). Here is a script that includes the more robust security concepts hinted at in the basic example.

```
#!/bin/sh
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"

# No environment is passed to svn hook scripts; set paths to external tools explicitly:
WGET=/usr/bin/wget
SVNLOOK=/usr/bin/svnlook

# If your server requires authentication, it is recommended that you set up a .netrc file to store your username and password
# Better yet, since Jenkins v. 1.426, use the generated API Token in place of the password
# See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients
# Since no environment is passed to hook scripts, you need to set $HOME (where your .netrc lives)
# By convention, this should be the home dir of whichever user is running the svn process (i.e. apache)
HOME=/var/www/

UUID=`$SVNLOOK uuid $REPOS`
NOTIFY_URL="subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=${REV}"
CRUMB_ISSUER_URL='crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'

function notifyCI {
    # URL to Jenkins server application (with protocol, hostname, port and deployment descriptor if needed)
    CISERVER=$1

    # Check if "[X] Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" is activated
    # so we can present a valid crumb or a proper header
    CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER="--header Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
    CRUMB=`$WGET --auth-no-challenge --output-document - ${CISERVER}/${CRUMB_ISSUER_URL}`
    if [ "$CRUMB" != "" ]; then CRUMB_HEADER="--header $CRUMB"; fi

    $WGET \
        --auth-no-challenge \
        $CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER \
        $CRUMB_HEADER \
        --post-data "`$SVNLOOK changed --revision $REV $REPOS`" \
        --output-document "-"\
        --timeout=2 \
        ${CISERVER}/${NOTIFY_URL}
}

# The code above was placed in a function so you can easily notify multiple Jenkins servers:
notifyCI "http://myPC.company.local:8080"
notifyCI "http://jenkins.company.com:8080/jenkins"

```

The script above takes care of the Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits option if you have it enabled on your server. If you do not have that option enabled, the extra wget call is harmless, but feel free to remove it if you do not need it. The script above also requires that you set up a .netrc file in the home directory of the user you are running subversion as (either the svnserve process or httpd). For more info on .netrc file syntax, look [here](http://www.mavetju.org/unix/netrc.php). The script above makes it easy to notify multiple Jenkins servers of the same SVN commit. If you have a .netrc file, it keeps it easy even if they have different admin users set up. If you don't want to mess with a .netrc file, you could just hard-code the user and password (or API Token) info in the file and add --username=user and --password="pass" flags to the wget calls.

### Windows specific post-commit hook

The above script is difficult under the Windows command processor seeing as there is no support for backtick output extraction and there is no built in wget command. Instead the following contents can be added to `post-commit.bat` (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory):

```
SET REPOS=%1
SET REV=%2
SET CSCRIPT=%windir%\system32\cscript.exe
SET VBSCRIPT=C:\Repositories\post-commit-hook-jenkins.vbs
SET SVNLOOK=C:\Subversion\svnlook.exe
SET JENKINS=http://server/
REM AUTHORIZATION: Set to "" for anonymous acceess
REM AUTHORIZATION: Set to encoded Base64 string, generated from "user_id:api_token"
REM                found on Jenkins under "user/configure/API token"
REM                User needs "Job/Read" permission on Jenkins
SET AUTHORIZATION=""
"%CSCRIPT%" "%VBSCRIPT%" "%REPOS%" %2 "%SVNLOOK%" %JENKINS% %AUTHORIZATION%

```

The batch file relies on the following VBScript being available in the file designated by the `VBSCRIPT` variable above:

```
repos         = WScript.Arguments.Item(0)
rev           = WScript.Arguments.Item(1)
svnlook       = WScript.Arguments.Item(2)
jenkins       = WScript.Arguments.Item(3)
authorization = WScript.Arguments.Item(4)

Set shell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

Set uuidExec = shell.Exec(svnlook & " uuid " & repos)
Do Until uuidExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  uuid = uuidExec.StdOut.ReadLine()
Loop
Wscript.Echo "uuid=" & uuid

Set changedExec = shell.Exec(svnlook & " changed --revision " & rev & " " & repos)
Do Until changedExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  changed = changed + changedExec.StdOut.ReadLine() + Chr(10)
Loop
Wscript.Echo "changed=" & changed

url = jenkins + "crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,"":"",//crumb)"
Set http = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
http.open "GET", url, False
http.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
if not authorization = "" then
  http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Basic " + authorization
end if
http.send
crumb = null
if http.status = 200 then
  crumb = split(http.responseText,":")
end if

url = jenkins + "subversion/" + uuid + "/notifyCommit?rev=" + rev
Wscript.Echo url

Set http = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
http.open "POST", url, False
http.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
if not authorization = "" then
  http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Basic " + authorization
end if
if not isnull(crumb) then
  http.setRequestHeader crumb(0),crumb(1)
end if
http.send changed
if http.status <> 200 then
  Wscript.Echo "Error. HTTP Status: " & http.status & ". Body: " & http.responseText
end if

```

## Perform Polling from the Controller

JIRA [JENKINS-5413](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5413) documents problems with running the SCM polling trigger on agents. Version 1.21 of the Subversion plugin can perform the polling on the Jenkins controller if the hudson.scm.SubversionSCM.pollFromMaster system property is set to true.

## Subversion Revision and URL information as Environment Variables

The Subversion SCM plugin exports the svn revisions and URLs of the build's subversion modules as environment variables. These are $SVN\_REVISION\_n and $SVN\_URL\_n, where n is the 1-based index of the module in the configuration.

For backwards compatibility if there's only a single module, its values are also exported as $SVN\_REVISION and $SVN\_URL.

Note that the revision number exposed is the 'last-changed' revision number of the particular directory and not the current revision of the repository. (See [What are these two revision numbers in svn info?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9354877/what-are-these-two-revision-numbers-in-svn-info))

## Kerberos authentication

To connect to a Kerberos authenticated SVN repository see the [Subversion Plugin HTTPS Kerberos authentication](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Subversion%2BPlugin%2BHTTPS%2BKerberos%2Bauthentication) page.

# TroubleShooting

Someone suggested in the Jenkins IRC channel that if you are getting an error and a long svnkit stack trace that looks like:

```
 ERROR: svn: authentication cancelled

org.tmatesoft.svn.core.SVNCancelException: svn: authentication cancelled

```

Then,

* Try to delete (back up) the ~/.subversion folder and retry the build. Apparently mixing the command line svn client checkouts with those of your Jenkins jobs messes it up.
* See <http://blog.vinodsingh.com/2009/08/hudson-svn-authentication-cancelled.html> for details.

You could try to enable verbose log over the plugin an SVNKit library, to do that add a logger to those loggers with log level ALL , it is really verbose so just after configure it make the test and change the log level again to ERROR or INFO.

* svnkit
* svnkit-network
* svnkit-wc
* hudson.scm.SubversionSCM

## lightweight checkout capability for Subversion on Multibranch Pipeline projects and Externals support

Lightweight checkout capability for Subversion on Multibranch Pipeline projects does not support externals, so in order to use Subversion plugin in a Multibranch Pipeline project with a repository with externals, you should disable the lightweight checkout capability by setting the property `-Djenkins.scm.impl.subversion.SubversionSCMFileSystem.disable=<true/false>`

SECURITY-1710 / CVE-2020-2109
Sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.78 and earlier can be
circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed
methods.

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1713 / CVE-2020-2110
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.69 and earlier can be
circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST
transforming annotations such as `@...b` to imports or by using them inside
of other annotations. This affects both script execution (typically invoked
from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing
sandboxed script validation.

Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox
protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

This issue is due to an incomplete fix of SECURITY-1266.

SECURITY-1725 / CVE-2020-2111
Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for
the Project Repository Base URL field form validation. This results in a
stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to
specify such base URLs, for example users able to configure Multibranch
Pipelines.

SECURITY-1709 / CVE-2020-2112 (parameter name) & CVE-2020-2113 (default value)
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.11 and earlier does not correctly escape the
parameter name or default value. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1684 / CVE-2020-2114
S3 publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4
and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1752 / CVE-2020-2115
NUnit Plugin 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-812 (1) / CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check)
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform
permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-812 (2) / CVE-2020-2118
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of
applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select
the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1717 / CVE-2020-2119
Azure AD Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Azure AD Plugin 1.1.2 and
earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1751 / CVE-2020-2120
FitNesse Plugin 1.30 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-1731 / CVE-2020-2121
