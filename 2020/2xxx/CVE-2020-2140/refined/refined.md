Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2140:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Audit Trail Plugin, in versions 3.2 and earlier, fails to properly escape the error message generated during the validation of the "URL Patterns" field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error message. This injected script can then be executed within the context of a user's browser when they view the error, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing of sensitive information
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins UI
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL that includes a payload in the `URL Patterns` field that would be reflected in an error message within the Jenkins UI.
*   The victim would need to be tricked into visiting this malicious URL while logged into Jenkins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges. Any user with access to the Jenkins instance can trigger this vulnerability, since it's related to form validation.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and convince the victim to access it.
*   The advisory mentions that this can be exploited similar to a stored XSS vulnerability by users with Overall/Administer permission. This implies that an admin user could also cause a stored XSS via the same vulnerability, by submitting crafted URL Patterns and having them reflected on subsequent visits to the admin page.
