Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2192:

**CVE-2020-2192** is related to a **CSRF vulnerability** found in the **Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin** (Swarm Plugin) for Jenkins.

**Root Cause:**
- The Swarm Plugin added API endpoints to add or remove agent labels. These endpoints, in versions 3.20 and earlier, did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of POST request enforcement for the label manipulation endpoints allowed an attacker to craft malicious links or web pages that, when accessed by an authenticated Jenkins user, would trigger unintended modifications (adding/removing labels) to agents on the Jenkins controller.
- **Improper Permission Checks:** While technically CVE-2020-2191, the related issue is that these API endpoints only required a global Swarm secret to be used and no permission check was performed. This allowed users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent instead of just those they have permission to modify.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could add or remove labels from any agent in the Jenkins environment. This could disrupt the job scheduling or cause other issues by making agents unavailable for certain types of jobs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request triggered by an authenticated Jenkins user. This could be achieved by:
  - Embedding a malicious link in an email or chat message.
  - Creating a malicious website that automatically sends the crafted request when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a user who is already authenticated to Jenkins and who has "Agent/Create" permission into visiting a malicious link or page.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges on Jenkins itself.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
- The fix involves Swarm Plugin version 3.21 and later requiring POST requests for the mentioned API endpoints, as well as an Agent/Configure permission for the target agent. The global swarm secret is no longer used for these endpoints.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
