Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Timestamper Plugin versions 1.11.1 and earlier do not properly escape or sanitize HTML formatting used to display timestamps in the Jenkins console output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization of HTML formatting allows malicious HTML/JavaScript code to be embedded within the timestamps. This code is then stored and executed within the Jenkins console output when viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the context of the victim's browser session when viewing the Jenkins console output. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim within the Jenkins environment.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content displayed on the Jenkins web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker with the `Overall/Administer` permission can craft a Jenkins build or log output that includes malicious HTML formatting within the timestamp section. This malicious formatting is then stored within Jenkins's logs.
*   When a user views the console output of the affected builds, the injected JavaScript executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires `Overall/Administer` permissions within the Jenkins instance to craft a build log containing the malicious HTML formatting.
*   The attacker needs a way to trigger a build that will display the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Timestamper Plugin version 1.11.2, which sanitizes the HTML formatting for timestamps, allowing only basic, safe HTML.
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored in the system, and is executed when an administrator visits the console output of a build that has been poisoned.
