Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2194:

**CVE Description:**

*   **CVE-2020-2194**: ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with `Run/Update` permission.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The ECharts API Plugin fails to properly escape the display name of builds when rendering trend charts. This allows for the injection of malicious code through the build display name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it does not sanitize user-controlled input (the display name of builds) before rendering it in the web UI.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users when they view the affected Jenkins pages (trend charts). This can lead to a variety of impacts, such as:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins UI
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious actions that are possible through JavaScript execution

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to modify the display name of a build. This can be achieved if the attacker has `Run/Update` permission on a job. This could be done either through direct manipulation or through a malicious script included in a build process.
*   The injected malicious script is stored and executed each time a user views the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Permission:** The attacker needs `Run/Update` permission for a Jenkins job to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to inject a malicious payload into the display name of a Jenkins build.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in ECharts API Plugin version 4.7.0-4, which properly escapes the display name before rendering it.
*   The advisory states that the vulnerability is a "Stored XSS"
