Relevant to CVE-2020-2183
```

*   **Root Cause:** Improper permission checks in the Copy Artifact Plugin.
*   **Vulnerability:** The plugin performs insufficient permission checks when determining if a build is allowed to copy artifacts from another project's build.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Job/Configure permission can configure jobs to copy artifacts from projects they lack permission to access.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with Job/Configure permissions can configure a job to copy artifacts from a source job to which they do not have access.
*   **Affected Versions:** Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44 and switch from "Migration mode" to "Production mode".
