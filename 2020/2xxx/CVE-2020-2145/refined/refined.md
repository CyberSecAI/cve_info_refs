*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin stores the Zephyr password in plain text within its global configuration file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive information (Zephyr password) in plaintext instead of using encryption.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with access to the Jenkins master file system can read the configuration file and obtain the Zephyr password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to Zephyr.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves direct access to the Jenkins master's file system where the configuration file is stored.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins master's file system, typically requiring local system access.
