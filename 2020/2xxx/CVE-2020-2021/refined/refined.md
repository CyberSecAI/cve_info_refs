  "CVE-2020-2021": {
    "description": "When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "Improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication when the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is disabled.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Improper signature verification"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated network-based attacker can gain access to protected resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.",
        "affected_versions": [
        "PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3",
        "PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9",
        "PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15",
        "All versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL)"
        ],
    "additional_details": "The issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. The issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication or if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication include GlobalProtect Gateway."
