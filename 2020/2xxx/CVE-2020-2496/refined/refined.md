- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in File Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The web application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the File Station interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow remote attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into the File Station interface. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement of the web interface, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can inject malicious code through the File Station interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application (File Station) remotely and have the ability to inject client-side script.
