Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2268:

**CVE-2020-2268**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The MongoDB Plugin (versions 1.3 and earlier) does not require POST requests for form validation methods, which leads to a CSRF vulnerability. Additionally, there are missing permission checks in these form validation methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation methods can be triggered via GET requests instead of the more secure POST requests. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a user into unknowingly making requests to the Jenkins server.
    *  **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin doesn't properly check user permissions when performing form validation, allowing unauthorized users to access metadata of arbitrary files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain access to some metadata of any arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user into making a crafted request (e.g., through a malicious link or website).
    *   The missing permission checks allow an attacker with Overall/Read permission to access file metadata.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a Jenkins user into making a malicious request to the Jenkins server (CSRF).
    *   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in MongoDB Plugin version 1.3 and earlier.
*   No fix is available as of the advisory publication.
*   The vulnerability is identified by SECURITY-1904 (along with CVE-2020-2267, which covers the missing permission check).
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is Medium.
