Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2252:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Mailer Plugin does not validate the hostname of the SMTP server it connects to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Hostname Validation:** The plugin fails to verify the identity of the SMTP server, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker can intercept communication between the Jenkins server and the SMTP server.
*   **Data Interception:** Potentially sensitive information, such as email content or authentication credentials, could be intercepted by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the Jenkins server and the SMTP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the SMTP server.
*   **MitM Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*  **No authentication required**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Mailer Plugin version 1.32.1.
*   Prior to the fix, administrators could enable hostname validation by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true`.
