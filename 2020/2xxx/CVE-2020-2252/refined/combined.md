# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

This plugin allows you to configure email notifications for build results. This is a break-out of the original core based email component.

## Configuration

In order to be able to send E-Mail notifications mail server configuration must be introduced in the *Manage Jenkins* page, *Configure System > E-mail Notification* section. Available options are:

* **SMTP server**: Name of the mail server. If empty the system will try to use the default server (which is normally the one running on `localhost`). Jenkins uses [JavaMail](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/) for sending out e-mails, and JavaMail allows additional settings to be given as system properties to the container. See [this document](http://jenkins-ci.org/javamail-properties) for possible values and effects.
* **Default user e-mail suffix**: If your users' e-mail addresses can be computed automatically by simply adding a suffix, then specify that suffix if this field. Otherwise leave it empty. Note that users can always override the e-mail address selectively. For example, if this field is set to `@acme.org`, then user foo will by default get the e-mail address [foo@acme.org](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mailer-plugin/blob/master/mailto%3Afoo%40acme.org).

There are some advanced options as well:

* **Use SMTP Authentication**: check this option to use SMTP authentication when sending out e-mails. If your environment requires the use of SMTP authentication, specify the user name and the password in the fields shown when this option is checked.
* **Use SSL**: Whether or not to use SSL for connecting to the SMTP server. Defaults to port `465`. Other advanced configurations can be done by setting system properties. See this document for possible values and effects.
* **Use TLS**: Whether or not to use TLS for connecting to the SMTP server. Defaults to port `587`. Other advanced configurations can be done by setting system properties. See this document for possible values and effects.
* **SMTP Port**: Port number for the mail server. Leave it empty to use the default port for the protocol (`587` if using TLS, `465` if using SSL, `25` if not using encryption).
* **Reply-To Address**: Address to include in the `Reply-To` header. Up to version `1.16`, only one address is allowed, starting in version `1.17` more than one can be used.
* **Charset**: character set to use to construct the message.

In order to test the configuration, you can check the *Test configuration by sending test e-mail* checkbox, provide a destination address at the *Test e-mail recipient* field and clicking the *Test configuration* button.

## Usage

E-Mail notifications are configured in jobs by adding an *E-mail notification* Post-build Action. If configured, Jenkins will send out an e-mail to the specified recipients when a certain important event occurs:

* Every failed build triggers a new e-mail.
* A successful build after a failed (or unstable) build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that a crisis is over.
* An unstable build after a successful build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that there’s a regression.
* Unless configured, every unstable build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that regression is still there.

The Recipients field must contain a whitespace or comma-separated list of recipient addresses. May reference build parameters like `$PARAM`.

Additional options include:

* **Send e-mail for every unstable build**: if checked, notifications will be sent for every unstable build and not only the first build after a successful one.
* **Send separate e-mails to individuals who broke the build**: if checked, the notification e-mail will be sent to individuals who have committed changes for the broken build (by assuming that those changes broke the build). If e-mail addresses are also specified in the recipient list, then both the individuals as well as the specified addresses get the notification e-mail. If the recipient list is empty, then only the individuals will receive e-mails.

SECURITY-1968 (2) / CVE-2020-2278
Storable Configs Plugin allows storing copies of a job's `config.xml` file
on the Jenkins controller with a user-specified file name.

Storable Configs Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not restrict the
user-specified file name, except that a `.xml` suffix is added if it's not
already present. This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to
replace any other `.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with the job's
`config.xml` file's content.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

The validating string parameter plugin contributes a new parameter type to Jenkins that supports regular expression validation of the user's entered parameter.

# Usage

This plugin is used wherever build parameter selection is available, most commonly in the job configuration page by enabling parameterized builds (this parameter type will also be available as release parameters using the [release plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/release/)).

Configure the parameter by entering a name, regular expression to validate the entered value and optionally a default value, an error message shown when the user entered value fails the regular expression check and a parameter description.

When a build is requested, the user will be prompted with the parameters to enter. Users enter the parameter as normal, but will now be prompted with an error message if the entered value does not meet the regular expression.

Once the entered value meets the configured regular expression, the error message is no longer displayed.

**SECURITY-1813
/
CVE-2020-2252**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Mailer Plugin 1.32.1 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
In Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.

In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` on startup.

### Missing hostname validation in Email Extension Plugin

**SECURITY-1851
/
CVE-2020-2253**

**Severity (CVSS):**

[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`storable-configs-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/storable-configs-plugin)**

**Description:**

Storable Configs Plugin allows storing copies of a job’s `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with a user-specified file name.

Storable Configs Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not restrict the user-specified file name, except that a `.xml` suffix is added if it’s not already present.
This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to replace any other `.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with the job’s `config.xml` file’s content.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
