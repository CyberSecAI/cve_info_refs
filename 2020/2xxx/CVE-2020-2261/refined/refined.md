Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2261:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `perfecto` Plugin allows specifying a "Perfecto Connect Path" and "Perfecto Connect File Name" in job configurations. The plugin then executes the specified command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OS Command Execution:** The plugin executes the user-specified commands without proper sanitization or sandboxing on the Jenkins controller.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins controller with the privileges of the Jenkins process. This can lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins server and its resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   By configuring a job to execute a malicious command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have `Job/Configure` permission to modify job configurations.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in `perfecto` Plugin versions 1.17 and earlier.
*   Version 1.18 executes commands on the agent instead of the controller, thus fixing the vulnerability.
