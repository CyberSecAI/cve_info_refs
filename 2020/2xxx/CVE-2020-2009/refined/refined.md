Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an "external control of filename" issue in the SD-WAN component of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Panorama. This means that an attacker can influence the name and path of a file being created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** The system allows an external user (authenticated administrator) to control the filename or path used when creating a file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** An authenticated administrator can send a crafted request to Panorama, leading to the creation of an arbitrary file on all managed firewalls.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, this can result in arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected firewalls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator of the Panorama management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for PAN-OS Panorama.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Panorama management interface.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
This vulnerability allows a high-privileged user to write arbitrary files to firewalls managed by Panorama via the SD-WAN component. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
