Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2153:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Backlog Plugin stores credentials in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
- While these credentials are encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Plaintext Transmission of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the transmission of credentials in plain text during the configuration form submission process. This exposes the credentials to potential interception.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Credentials:**  The primary impact is the exposure of user credentials. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or potentially through browser extensions or other means.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the Backlog system integrated with Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network Interception:** An attacker could intercept the plain text credentials while they are being transmitted during the configuration form submission.
- **Browser Extensions/XSS:** Malicious browser extensions or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could potentially capture the plain text credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users with "Extended Read" permission on the Jenkins server could view these credentials in the job configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic to capture credentials during transmission.
- **Jenkins Access:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can view these exposed credentials. An attacker could also use XSS or browser extensions to capture the credentials from the user's browser.
