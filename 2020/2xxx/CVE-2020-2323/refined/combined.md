# Jenkins Security Advisory 2020-12-03

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Chaos Monkey
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)
* [Chaos Monkey
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)
* [CVS
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)
* [Shelve Project
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shelve-project-plugin)
* Plugin Installation Manager Tool

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-2146
/
CVE-2020-2324**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.16 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

CVS Plugin 2.17 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### Plugin Installation Manager Tool did not verify plugin downloads

**SECURITY-1856
/
CVE-2020-2320**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

Plugin Installation Manager Tool is part of the Jenkins project Docker images.
As `jenkins-plugin-cli` it is used to download and install plugins even before Jenkins is running.

Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.1.3 and earlier does not verify plugin downloads.
This may allow third parties such as mirror operators to provide crafted plugin downloads.

Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0 confirms that actual checksums of downloaded plugin match the expected checksums.

Docker images of Jenkins 2.269 and 2.263.1 contain Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0.
Users of older Docker images can change the version they use by extending the Jenkins image and update the tool themselves with:

```
ARG PLUGIN_CLI_URL=https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/releases/download/2.2.0/jenkins-plugin-manager-2.2.0.jar
RUN curl -fsSL ${PLUGIN_CLI_URL} -o /usr/lib/jenkins-plugin-manager.jar
```

Jenkinsfile Runner [1.0-beta-22](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/releases/tag/1.0-beta-22) Docker images also include Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0.

### CSRF vulnerability in Shelve Project Plugin

**SECURITY-2108
/
CVE-2020-2321**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`shelve-project-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shelve-project-plugin)**

**Description:**

Shelve Project Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to shelve, unshelve, or delete a project.

Shelve Project Plugin 3.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing permission checks in Chaos Monkey Plugin

**SECURITY-2109 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2322**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`chaos-monkey`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)**

**Description:**

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to generate load and to generate memory leaks.

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 requires Overall/Administer permission to generate load and to generate memory leaks.

### Missing permission checks in Chaos Monkey Plugin

**SECURITY-2109 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2323**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`chaos-monkey`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)**

**Description:**

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the Chaos Monkey page and to see the history of actions.

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4.1 requires Overall/Administer permission to access the Chaos Monkey page and to see the history of actions.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1856:

# Chaos Monkey

How to install

# Chaos Monkey Plugin

This plugin was written to help the development of a CLI tool interacting with Jenkins. The need is to have a instance of Jenkins in a bad shape to gauge how the CLI handles it.

There are currently only 2 features:

* A latency injector, accessible from the Global Configuration of Jenkins:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin@master/doc/latencyInjector.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin/blob/master/./doc/latencyInjector.png)

* A queue locker accessible as a Global Action :

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin@master/doc/queueLocker.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin/blob/master/./doc/queueLocker.png)

* A load generator (CPU) accessible as a Global Action:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin@master/doc/loadGenerator.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin/blob/master/./doc/loadGenerator.png)

* A memory leak generator accessible as a Global Action:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin@master/doc/memoryLeak.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/chaos-monkey-plugin/blob/master/./doc/memoryLeak.png)

## Warning

This plugin is for testing and development purposes and should never be installed on a production instance!

# Plan

* Review the way the CPU load is generated works on Kubernetes
* Add some http request load generator

## About the name of the plugin

It comes from the well known Netflix [Chaos Monkey tool](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey). Thanks to Arnaud Héritier for suggesting it.
