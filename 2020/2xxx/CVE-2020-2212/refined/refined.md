Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2212:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-2212

**Vulnerability:** Secret stored in plain text

**Affected Plugin:** GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 1.8 and earlier

**Root Cause:**
The GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin stores a GitHub access token in plain text in its global configuration file (`io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`) on the Jenkins master.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The plugin stores a GitHub access token without encryption. This exposes the token to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker gaining access to the Jenkins master file system can read the configuration file and obtain the plaintext GitHub access token. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Access the associated GitHub repository.
    - Potentially modify the repository depending on the permissions associated with the token.
    - Access other resources or systems authorized by the GitHub token.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Attackers need access to the Jenkins master's file system to read the configuration file where the token is stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to access the Jenkins master server's file system. This could be due to:
    - Compromised user accounts with file system access.
    - Direct access to the Jenkins server's file system.
    - Exploitation of other vulnerabilities allowing file system access.

**Additional Notes:**
- There was no fix available at the time of the security advisory publication.
- Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the token.
- The advisory provides a CVSS score of Medium for this vulnerability, with a CVSS vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
