Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2234:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows unauthorized access to a specific functionality.
- Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with `Overall/Read` access to interact with sensitive functionality that should require higher privileges.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method does not validate the origin of the request, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Capture:** Attackers can exploit the missing permission check to connect to an attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credential IDs. This could lead to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins, as an attacker can obtain credential IDs through another vulnerability (CVE-2020-2233).
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Combined with the lack of CSRF protection, an attacker could induce a logged-in user to unintentionally perform actions (such as connecting to an attacker-controlled JDBC server), potentially leaking credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through HTTP requests.
- **User Interaction:** A user with `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins is required to trigger the vulnerability (for the permission check bypass), or a user with an active session can be tricked into initiating the attack through CSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
- For the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.
- The attacker also needs to know or obtain a valid credential ID to use in the attack, which they can obtain using CVE-2020-2233.

**Additional details:**
- The issue is present in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin versions 3.8.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin version 3.8.3, which requires POST requests and Job/Configure permission for the affected form validation method.
- The advisory highlights that this vulnerability is linked to CVE-2020-2235 (CSRF) and CVE-2020-2233 (credential ID enumeration), emphasizing the importance of addressing all three vulnerabilities.
