Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Parasoft Findings Plugin, up to version 10.4.3, does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE injection. It does not disable external entity resolution, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
- Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable by users who can control the input files processed by the Parasoft Findings parser. This includes injecting malicious code into XML files used for static analysis by the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser. This often implies that the attacker has at least the "read" permission for the relevant jobs or SCM repositories. They must have the ability to upload or modify the analyzed files.
