# Jenkins Security Advisory 2020-04-16

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [AWS SAM
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aws-sam)
* [Copr
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copr)
* [Parasoft Findings
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/parasoft-findings)
* [Yaml Axis
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yaml-axis)

## Descriptions

### Credentials stored in plain text by Copr Plugin

**SECURITY-1556
/
CVE-2020-2177**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copr)**

**Description:**

Copr Plugin 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Copr Plugin 0.6.1 stores these credentials encrypted.
This change is effective once the job configuration is saved the next time.

### XXE vulnerability in Parasoft Findings Plugin

**SECURITY-1753
/
CVE-2020-2178**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`parasoft-findings`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/parasoft-findings)**

**Description:**

Parasoft Findings Plugin implements a static analysis parser for various Parasoft products and integrates with [Warnings Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings) (10.4.1 and earlier) and [Warnings NG Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng) (10.4.2 and newer).

Parasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.3 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This allows a user able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Parasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.4 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### RCE vulnerability in Yaml Axis Plugin

**SECURITY-1825
/
CVE-2020-2179**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`yaml-axis`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yaml-axis)**

**Description:**

Yaml Axis Plugin 0.2.0 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a multi-configuration (Matrix) job, or control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

Yaml Axis Plugin 0.2.1 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

### RCE vulnerability in AWS SAM Plugin

**SECURITY-1736
/
CVE-2020-2180**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`aws-sam`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aws-sam)**

**Description:**

AWS SAM Plugin 1.2.2 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a job or control the contents of a previously configured "AWS SAM deploy application" build step’s YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or equivalent) file.

AWS SAM Plugin 1.2.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1556:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
* SECURITY-1736:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* SECURITY-1753:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1825:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Versions

* **AWS SAM
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  1.2.2
* **Copr
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  0.3
* **Parasoft Findings
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  10.4.3
* **Yaml Axis
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  0.2.0

## Fix

* **AWS SAM
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  1.2.3
* **Copr
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  0.6.1
* **Parasoft Findings
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  10.4.4
* **Yaml Axis
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  0.2.1

These versions include fixes to the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are considered to be affected by these vulnerabilities unless otherwise indicated.
