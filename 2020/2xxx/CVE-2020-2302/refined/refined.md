- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Active Directory plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint that allows access to the domain health check diagnostic page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can access the domain health check diagnostic page, potentially revealing sensitive information about the Active Directory domain.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can access the vulnerable HTTP endpoint directly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance.
