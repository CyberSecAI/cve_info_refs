Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2219:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Link Column Plugin version 1.0 and earlier does not properly filter the URL for links configured by users, allowing the use of the `javascript:` scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided URLs, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
