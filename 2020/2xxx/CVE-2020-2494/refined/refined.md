- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Music Station application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can inject malicious code that could be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious code through the vulnerable Music Station application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Music Station application in order to inject the malicious code, which implies the attacker needs network access to the service.
