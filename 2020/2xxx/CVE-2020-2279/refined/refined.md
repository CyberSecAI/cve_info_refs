Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Script Security Plugin handled calls from outside a sandboxed script to code defined inside the sandboxed script. Prior to version 1.75, these calls were always allowed, effectively bypassing the sandbox restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** The core weakness is a sandbox bypass vulnerability. Code within a sandbox should be restricted, but this vulnerability allowed sandboxed code to be executed without the intended restrictions when called from outside the sandbox.
- **Missing Access Control:** The plugin failed to properly restrict access to code defined within a sandboxed script when called from outside the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins controller JVM. This could lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and the systems it interacts with.
- **Data Exposure & Modification:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information, modify data, or disrupt Jenkins' operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sandboxed Script Creation/Modification:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker with the ability to create or modify sandboxed scripts (including Pipelines).
- **Calling Sandboxed Code:** The vulnerability is triggered when code outside the sandbox makes a call to code defined inside the sandbox.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker needs to have the permission to define and run sandboxed scripts. This can be a "regular user" with limited permissions such as Job/Configure.
- **Jenkins Access:** The attacker requires access to the Jenkins instance to define and execute scripts.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability was caused by allowing calls from outside a sandbox to code inside a sandbox without proper checks.
- Sandboxed scripts can return values and use other mechanisms for communicating outside the sandbox, which was a factor in the bypass.
- The fix in Script Security Plugin 1.75 prevents code inside a sandbox from being invoked without sandbox protection.
- Some plugins might be affected by this fix since sandboxed scripts may return values or bindings, which need to be converted to safe types such as String, if they include code defined in the sandbox, as further processing of this return value by the calling code can lead to a sandbox bypass. The advisory specifically mentions the Email Extension Plugin, Warnings Next Generation Plugin and Warnings Plugin needing to be updated to support the changes in the security fix.
