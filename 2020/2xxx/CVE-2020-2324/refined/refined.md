Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-2324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jenkins CVS Plugin, in versions 2.16 and earlier, does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XML external entity injection. This means that the parser will attempt to resolve external entities, which can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use XXE to extract sensitive information, such as secrets, from the Jenkins controller.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can use XXE to make the Jenkins controller perform requests to other internal or external servers, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources or causing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Changelog File:** The vulnerability is triggered when Jenkins parses a crafted changelog file that uses external entities. This file is processed by the CVS plugin.
*   **Agent Process Control:** The attacker needs to be able to control an agent process that can then send the crafted changelog file to the Jenkins controller. This implies that the attacker has compromised an agent machine, or has somehow been able to run commands on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Agent:** The attacker must have control over an agent process that the Jenkins controller interacts with.
*   **Knowledge of XML and XXE:** The attacker must know how to craft a malicious XML file with external entities to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Access to the Jenkins environment:** Attacker requires access to Jenkins or the agent to send the crafted XML.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is in CVS Plugin version 2.17, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
*   The vulnerability has a high severity rating based on CVSS.
