# Jenkins Security Advisory 2020-12-03

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Chaos Monkey
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)
* [Chaos Monkey
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)
* [CVS
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-2146
/
CVE-2020-2324**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.16 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

CVS Plugin 2.17 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### Plugin Installation Manager Tool did not verify plugin downloads

**SECURITY-1856
/
CVE-2020-2320**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Description:**

Plugin Installation Manager Tool is part of the Jenkins project Docker images.
As `jenkins-plugin-cli` it is used to download and install plugins even before Jenkins is running.

Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.1.3 and earlier does not verify plugin downloads.
This may allow third parties such as mirror operators to provide crafted plugin downloads.

Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0 confirms that actual checksums of downloaded plugin match the expected checksums.

Docker images of Jenkins 2.269 and 2.263.1 contain Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0.
Users of older Docker images can change the version they use by extending the Jenkins image and update the tool themselves with:

```
ARG PLUGIN_CLI_URL=https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/releases/download/2.2.0/jenkins-plugin-manager-2.2.0.jar
RUN curl -fsSL ${PLUGIN_CLI_URL} -o /usr/lib/jenkins-plugin-manager.jar
```

Jenkinsfile Runner [1.0-beta-22](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/releases/tag/1.0-beta-22) Docker images also include Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.2.0.

### CSRF vulnerability in Shelve Project Plugin

**SECURITY-2108
/
CVE-2020-2321**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`shelve-project-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shelve-project-plugin)**

**Description:**

Shelve Project Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to shelve, unshelve, or delete a project.

Shelve Project Plugin 3.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing permission checks in Chaos Monkey Plugin

**SECURITY-2109 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2322**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`chaos-monkey`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)**

**Description:**

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to generate load and to generate memory leaks.

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 requires Overall/Administer permission to generate load and to generate memory leaks.

### Missing permission checks in Chaos Monkey Plugin

**SECURITY-2109 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2323**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`chaos-monkey`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chaos-monkey)**

**Description:**

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the Chaos Monkey page and to see the history of actions.

Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4.1 requires Overall/Administer permission to access the Chaos Monkey page and to see the history of actions.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1856:

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you havenât audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

This plugin lets you shelve projects so that they can easily be resurrected. "Shelving a project" is like deleting a project into a recycle bin. When you shelve a project, it will disappear from the list of projects and become inaccessible from Jenkins, just like how it goes when a project is deleted, with one difference â instead of getting deleted, the data is archived into a tar file and stored on the server. This allows the administrator to resurrect it later (aka unshelving), in an unlikely event that the job turned out to be necessary.

This feature is convenient when you have lots of old jobs lying around, and you are 99% sure you wonât need them but you canât rule out 1% possibility that you might find them necessary later.

## Usage

When you install this plugin, you get "shelve project" in each job page, as follows:
 [![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin@master/docs/images/shelve-project-action.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/shelve-project-action.png)

You can click this icon and shelve the project. The shelved projects can be resurrected from the Jenkins top page:

* first click on the **Shelved Project** action:

[![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin@master/docs/images/unshelve-project-action.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/unshelve-project-action.png)

* Then choose the project you wish to unshelve:

[![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin@master/docs/images/unshelve-project-ui.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/unshelve-project-ui.png)

| Important | In order to unshelve, the user needs the **ADMINISTER** permission. |
| --- | --- |

## Security

Shelving a project requires the **DELETE** permission. Unshelving a project requires the **ADMINISTER** permission.

## Changelog

From version 2.5 on, changelog is automatically generated using [release-drafter](https://github.com/toolmantim/release-drafter). See directly theÂ [GitHub release page for the plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin/releases).

For older releases, have a look to the [archive](https://github.com/jenkinsci/shelve-project-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc).

## Known issue and workaround

### Fixed in 2.5

| Note | This issue has been fixed in release 2.5 of the plugin however all the shelves created using an earlier version of the plugin will have the issue and youâll need to apply the workaround. |
| --- | --- |

There is a currently a known issue in Core, making the tar function breaking the symlinks. Sadly, the Shelve Pipeline Plugin is using this tar function, and therefore the symlinks are lost during the shelving/unshelving process.

Up until Jenkins 2.90, this was mainly hidden from the end user, as Jenkins was silently fixing the symlinks during a build. But since this version, some changes made this issue visible.

This means that, when you unshelve a job, you will see a stack trace like this in all your build logs:

```
ln builds/lastSuccessfulBuild ***/jenkins-home/jobs/toto/lastSuccessful failed
java.nio.file.DirectoryNotEmptyException: ***/jenkins-home/jobs/toto/lastSuccessful
    at sun.nio.fs.UnixFileSystemProvider.implDelete(UnixFileSystemProvider.java:242)
    at sun.nio.fs.AbstractFileSystemProvider.deleteIfExists(AbstractFileSystemProvider.java:108)
    at java.nio.file.Files.deleteIfExists(Files.java:1165)
    at hudson.Util.createSymlink(Util.java:1333)
    at hudson.model.Run.createSymlink(Run.java:1866)
    at hudson.model.Run.updateSymlinks(Run.java:1847)
    at hudson.model.Run.execute(Run.java:1725)
    at hudson.model.FreeStyleBuild.run(FreeStyleBuild.java:43)
    at hudson.model.ResourceController.execute(ResourceController.java:97)
    at hudson.model.Executor.run(Executor.java:421)
```

While this wonât affect the output of your build, this is far from convenient. A workaround for this issue is to manually delete the wrongly created files using a script. Here is an example:

* First make a dry run to ensure the script is not deleting something it shouldnât:

```
find ${JENKINS_HOME}/jobs/ -type d \( -name lastFailedBuild -o -name lastSuccessfulBuild -o -name lastUnsuccessfulBuild -o -name lastStableBuild -o -name lastUnstableBuild -o -name lastFailed -o -name lastSuccessful -o -name lastUnsuccessful -o -name lastStable -o -name lastUnstable \)
```

* Then, do the real cleaning:

```
find ${JENKINS_HOME}/jobs/ -type d \( -name lastFailedBuild -o -name lastSuccessfulBuild -o -name lastUnsuccessfulBuild -o -name lastStableBuild -o -name lastUnstableBuild -o -name lastFailed -o -name lastSuccessful -o -name lastUnsuccessful -o -name lastStable -o -name lastUnstable \) -exec rm -rfv "{}" \;
```

## License

The plugin follows Jenkins licensing (exception listed below).

File manager icon (shelve-project-icon.png) was released into the public domain by the **Tango! Desktop Project**. The original image can be found [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASystem-file-manager.svg).

SECURITY-2146 / CVE-2020-2324
CVS Plugin 2.16 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins
parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction
of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1856 / CVE-2020-2320
Plugin Installation Manager Tool is part of the Jenkins project Docker
images. As `jenkins-plugin-cli` it is used to download and install plugins
even before Jenkins is running.

Plugin Installation Manager Tool 2.1.3 and earlier does not verify plugin
downloads. This may allow third parties such as mirror operators to provide
crafted plugin downloads.

SECURITY-2108 / CVE-2020-2321
Shelve Project Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for
HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to shelve, unshelve, or delete a
project.

SECURITY-2109 (1) / CVE-2020-2322
Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.3 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to generate load and to
generate memory leaks.

SECURITY-2109 (2) / CVE-2020-2323
Chaos Monkey Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the Chaos
Monkey page and to see the history of actions.
