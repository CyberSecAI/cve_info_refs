Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2251:

**CVE-2020-2251**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** ReadyAPI Functional Testing Plugin (soapui-pro-functional-testing)
*   **Root Cause:** Passwords transmitted in plain text.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   The plugin stores project passwords in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
    *   Although the passwords are encrypted on disk since version 1.4 of the plugin, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the global configuration form in version 1.5 and earlier.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with "Extended Read" permission can view the project passwords transmitted in plain text.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting network traffic when the global configuration form is submitted.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have "Extended Read" permission to access the global configuration form and view the transmitted password.
    *   An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic could also exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   This vulnerability only affects Jenkins versions before 2.236 (including the 2.235.x LTS). Jenkins 2.236 introduced a security hardening that encrypts and decrypts password form field data.
    *   No fix was available at the time of the advisory's publication.
