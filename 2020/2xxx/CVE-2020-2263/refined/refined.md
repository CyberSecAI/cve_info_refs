Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2263:

**CVE-2020-2263**

*   **Root Cause:** The Radiator View Plugin does not properly sanitize job names before displaying them in tooltips.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to escape/encode job names, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the tooltip. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability by configuring a job name with malicious JavaScript code. When a user hovers over this job name, the unescaped script in the tooltip is executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs `Job/Configure` permission. This allows them to modify the name of a job and inject the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application and executed later when a user interacts with the affected element.
