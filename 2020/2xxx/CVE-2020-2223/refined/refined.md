**CVE-2020-2223**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `href` attribute of links to downstream jobs displayed in the build console page is not escaped.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of output sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `href` attribute of links, which will be executed in the browser of users who view the build console page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors**: By configuring the name of a downstream job with a malicious payload within the `href` attribute of a link to the job.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the `Job/Configure` permission to configure the downstream job name.
