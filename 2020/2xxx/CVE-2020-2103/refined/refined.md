  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2020-2103",
    "description": "Jenkins shows various technical details about the current user on the `/whoAmI` page. In [a previous fix](/security/advisory/2019-09-25/#SECURITY-1505), the `Cookie` header value containing the HTTP session ID was redacted. However, user metadata shown on this page could also include the HTTP session ID in Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier.\n\nThis allows attackers able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the HTTP session ID value from this page.\n\nJenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 no longer prints out the affected user metadata that might contain the HTTP session ID.\n\nAdditionally, we also redact values of further authentication-related HTTP headers in addition to `Cookie` on this page as a hardening.",
    "affectedProducts": [
      "Jenkins 2.218 and earlier",
      "Jenkins LTS 2.204.1 and earlier",
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11",
      "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The `/whoAmI` page in Jenkins was exposing user metadata, which could include the HTTP session ID. This was happening even after a previous fix that redacted the `Cookie` header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker exploiting a cross-site scripting vulnerability could obtain the HTTP session ID, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized actions.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network",
        "Exploiting a cross-site scripting vulnerability"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This usually requires some level of access/privileges to inject malicious script, or for a victim to be tricked into visiting a malicious site.",
    "additionalInformation": "The fix involves redacting the affected user metadata and authentication-related headers from the `/whoAmI` page."
