Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2296:

**CVE-2020-2296**

*   **Root Cause:** The Shared Objects Plugin does not require POST requests for a specific HTTP endpoint. This lack of enforcement allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the missing check for POST requests on a critical HTTP endpoint within the Shared Objects Plugin. This lack of request method validation is a common cause for CSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to configure shared objects within the Jenkins environment. The specific impact of this configuration change is not detailed in the provided text, but could allow an attacker to alter how jobs are built in Jenkins or the environments they use.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request sent to the vulnerable endpoint from a different origin (i.e., a different website). This is done by leveraging the user's authenticated session on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any specific permissions within Jenkins other than the ability to initiate a web request from a different site, a user must be logged into Jenkins at the same time the attacker launches a crafted request.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-2296 is a CSRF vulnerability in the Shared Objects Plugin that allows for malicious configuration of shared objects by crafting a request to a vulnerable endpoint that does not require POST requests.
