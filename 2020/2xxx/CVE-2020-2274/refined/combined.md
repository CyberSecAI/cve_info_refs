CVE-2020-2252**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Mailer Plugin 1.32.1 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
In Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.

In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` on startup.

### Missing hostname validation in Email Extension Plugin

**SECURITY-1851
/
CVE-2020-2253**

**Severity (CVSS):**

**Affected plugin:
[`email-ext`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext)**

**Description:**

Email Extension Plugin 2.75 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Email Extension Plugin 2.76 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
In Email Extension Plugin 2.75 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.
Alternatively, this protection can be enabled (or disabled in the new version) via the 'Advanced Email Properties' field in the plugin’s configuration in Configure System.

In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` using either method.

# ElasTest

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-09-16/#SECURITY-1903)**
* **[Passwords stored in plain text](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-09-16/#SECURITY-2014)**

**Deprecated:** This plugin has been marked as [deprecated](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/deprecating-or-removing-plugin). In general, this means that this plugin is either obsolete, no longer being developed, or may no longer work.

More information about the cause of this deprecation, and suggestions on how to proceed may be found at <https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2021/11/09/guava-upgrade/>.

# Description

This plugin allows Jenkins to be integrated with
[ElasTest](http://elastest.io/), an elastic platform to ease testing.

# Features

With this plugin you will be able to:

* Associate a Jenkins Job with an ElasTest TJob. You can create a new
  project on ElasTest or to use an existing project.
* Use a SUT managed by ElasTest (a SUT deployed by ElasTest or not)
* Send the logs of a build to ElasTest for advanced analyze (ElasTest
  provides the **Log Analyzer**, a powerfool tool for finding what you
  want in the vast flood of logs).
* Send logs and metrics of a SUT started in a Jenkins Job to ElasTest.
* Set ElasTest as your web browsers provider for your end to end
  tests.
* Request others test support services from ElasTest (ESS, EMS,...).
  For more information about this, visit the official
  ElasTest [documentation](https://elastest.io/docs/jenkins/).

# Setup

## Global Configuration

To set the configuration of the ElasTest plugin, navigate to 'Manage
Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration' and search the section labeled
with 'ElasTest Plugin'.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elastest/docs/images/plugin_configuration.jpg){width="1124"
height="173"}

In the image avobe you can see the following fields:

* **ElasTest URL:** URL where ElasTest is deployed. This field is
  mandatory.
* **Username:** username used to get access to ElasTest. If this field
  is filled, the password will be mandatory.
* \*\*Password: \*\* password to access to ElasTest.

If you want to use a user's credentials to access ElasTest, it will be
necessay to fill the "Username" and "Password" fields. Is you fill one
of them and leave the other empty, communication with ElasTest will be
done without authentication.

# Usage

You can use the ElasTest plugin if you use Jobs based on "Freestyle
project" or "Pipeline" templates.

## With Freestyle project

If you prefer to work with Freestyle projects, you should look at the
Job Configuration Page in the section "Build environment" and check the
option "Integrate the Job with ElasTest". With this, you will have
activated the shipping logs to ElasTest. If in addition to this, you
want to use the browser provided by ElasTest, you must check the EUS
field.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elastest/docs/images/freestyle_config.jpg){width="845"
height="250"}

In this type of projects, the ElasTest plugin not offers all it's
functionalities.

## With Pipeline

If you prefer to work with Jobs based on Pipeline templates instead, you
must add the next step to your pipeline script to wrap the rest of the
pipeline.

**Pipeline script**

```
node {
    elastest() {
        stage ('Executing test') {
        ............
        echo 'Cloning repository'
        ............
        echo 'Running test'
        ............
        }
    }
}

```

Above we have shown you a basic example without using any plugin option.
Here is an example with all the plugin options and below the
descriptions of them:

**Pipeline script**

```
node {
    elastest(tss: ['EUS'], surefireReportsPattern: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml', project: 'jenkins_project', sut: 5, monitoring: true, sutParams: ['PARAM_NAME': 'value']) {

        stage ('Executing test') {
        ............
        echo 'Cloning repository'
        ............
        echo 'Running test'
        ............
        }
    }
}

```

The meaning of each parameter is the following:

* **surefireReportsPattern:** will contain the path where the xml
  files containing the test results are stored and which will be used
  by ElasTest to display the test information. We explain this in more
  detail [here](https://elastest.io/docs/testing/unit#xmlAndtestResultsPath).
* **project:** is used to indicate the name of the ElasTest project
  where the TJob associated with Jenkins Job will be created. This
  field is optional and if it is not used, a project will be created
  with the same name as the Job.
* **sut:** allows you to select a Sut created in ElasTest against
  which to execute the job, indicating its id.
* **tss:** is used to indicate to ElasTest that the job needs to use
  the EUS service to use a web browser.
* **monitoring:** used to send or not the Sut monitoring traces to
  ElasTest.
* **sutParams:** used to send parameters to a SUT on ElasTest.
