Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2116:

**CVE-2020-2116**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method that implements form validation. Additionally, this method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Missing Permission Check**: The form validation method can be accessed by any user with Overall/Read access, without proper authorization.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability**: The form validation method does not require a POST request, which makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can exploit this vulnerability to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This allows for the potential capture of credentials stored within Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage that triggers the vulnerable method in the Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin.
    *   The attacker would need to obtain a valid credential ID through other means (e.g. via CVE-2020-2118, which allows enumeration of credential IDs without proper permission checks)

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker requires Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of a valid credential ID from the target Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability is located in the Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin, versions 1.0.4 and earlier.
* The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 1.0.5 of the plugin, which implements the necessary permission checks and requires POST requests for the form validation method.
