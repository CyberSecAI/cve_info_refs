Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2120:

**CVE-2020-2120**

*   **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
*   **Affected Plugin:** FitNesse Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.30 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The FitNesse Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin processes XML input without disabling external entity processing, which allows for the inclusion of malicious external entities in the XML file.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Users able to control the input files parsed by the FitNesse plugin's post-build step. This often involves configuration of the FitNesse plugin within a Jenkins project.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to configure a Jenkins job that uses the FitNesse plugin.
    *   The attacker must be able to specify or control the XML input files used by the FitNesse plugin.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract secrets from the Jenkins controller by exploiting the XXE vulnerability to read local files.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can cause the Jenkins controller to make requests to other internal or external servers.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can cause the Jenkins controller to become unavailable through various XXE based attacks.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to FitNesse Plugin version 1.31 or later. Version 1.31 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

**Summary**

The FitNesse Plugin prior to version 1.31 is vulnerable to XXE attacks. An attacker with the ability to control the XML input files can exploit this vulnerability to achieve information disclosure, SSRF, or DoS. The vulnerability is resolved in version 1.31, which disables external entity processing during XML parsing.
