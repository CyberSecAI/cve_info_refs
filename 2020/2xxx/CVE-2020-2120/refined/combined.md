---

SECURITY-1710 / CVE-2020-2109
Sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.78 and earlier can be
circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed
methods.

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1713 / CVE-2020-2110
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.69 and earlier can be
circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST
transforming annotations such as `@...b` to imports or by using them inside
of other annotations. This affects both script execution (typically invoked
from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing
sandboxed script validation.

Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox
protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

This issue is due to an incomplete fix of SECURITY-1266.

SECURITY-1725 / CVE-2020-2111
Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for
the Project Repository Base URL field form validation. This results in a
stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to
specify such base URLs, for example users able to configure Multibranch
Pipelines.

SECURITY-1709 / CVE-2020-2112 (parameter name) & CVE-2020-2113 (default value)
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.11 and earlier does not correctly escape the
parameter name or default value. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1684 / CVE-2020-2114
S3 publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4
and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1752 / CVE-2020-2115
NUnit Plugin 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-812 (1) / CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check)
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform
permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-812 (2) / CVE-2020-2118
Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of
applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select
the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1717 / CVE-2020-2119
Azure AD Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Azure AD Plugin 1.1.2 and
earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1751 / CVE-2020-2120
FitNesse Plugin 1.30 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step
to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery,
or denial-of-service attacks.

SECURITY-1731 / CVE-2020-2121
Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin 0.8.0 and earlier does not configure its
YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results
in a remote code execution vulnerability exploitable by users able to
provide YAML input files to Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1644 / CVE-2020-2122
Brakeman Plugin 0.12 and earlier did not escape values received from parsed
JSON files when rendering them, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be exploited by users able to control the Brakeman
post-build step input data.

SECURITY-1733 / CVE-2020-2123
RadarGun Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure RadarGun
Plugin's build step.

SECURITY-1560 / CVE-2020-2124
Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier stores a
Subversion password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration. This credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1558 / CVE-2020-2125
Debian Package Builder Plugin 1.6.11 and earlier stores a GPG passphrase
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`ru.yandex.jenkins.plugins.debuilder.DebianPackageBuilder.xml` on the
Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access to the
master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1559 / CVE-2020-2126
DigitalOcean Plugin 1.1 and earlier stores a token unencrypted in the
global `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This credential can
be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1547 / CVE-2020-2127
BMC Release Package and Deployment Plugin 1.1 and earlier stores the RPD
user token unencrypted in its global configuration file
`com.bmc.rpd.jenkins.plugin.bmcrpd.configuration.RPDPluginConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1549 / CVE-2020-2128
ECX Copy Data Management Plugin 1.9 and earlier stores a service password
unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This
credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1552 / CVE-2020-2129
Eagle Tester Plugin 1.0.9 and earlier stores a password unencrypted in its
global configuration file
`com.bmc.rpd.jenkins.plugin.bmcrpd.configuration.RPDPluginConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1553 / CVE-2020-2130 (global configuration) & CVE-2020-2131 (job configuration)
Harvest SCM Plugin 0.5.1 and earlier stores SCM passwords unencrypted in
its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.harvest.HarvestSCM.xml` and
in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission (job `config.xml` only) or
access to the master file system (both).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1562 / CVE-2020-2132
Parasoft Environment Manager Plugin 2.14 and earlier stores a repository
password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration. This credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1540 / CVE-2020-2133
Applatix Plugin 1.1 and earlier stores the Applatix password unencrypted in
job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This credential can be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file
system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# FitNesse

How to install

* [Documentation](/fitnesse/)
* [Releases](/fitnesse/releases/)
* [Issues](/fitnesse/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/fitnesse/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/fitnesse/healthscore/)

This plugin can be used to both execute and report on [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/) tests so that they can be integrated into a Jenkins build.
 Contributions are welcome, both bug fixes and new features. Just raise a pull request via GitHub.

[CI Server](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/fitnesse-plugin/)

## Configuration

### **Global**

* You could define a JDK installation (not mandatory). All JDKs will be available in the job configuration.

### **Agent node**

* If your job runs on a remote node and launches FitNesse, you should add the HOST\_NAME environment variable in the node configuration and set its value to the node’s hostname or IP. You can name it as fitnesse.yourdomain.com (whatever you like). This environment variable will be used when you set up the fitnesse instance below (it will replace localhost by the content of HOST\_NAME).

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/hostname.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/hostname.png)

Note: If you have the [EnvInject](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject/) plugin installed, Environment variables configured like in the image will not work. Use the EnvInject way instead. You will notice this by fitnesse still trying to connect to localhost, instead of the content in HOST\_NAME.

* You could also override JDK location used, by set a *Tool location*:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/tools_location.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/tools_location.png)

or by overridden JAVA\_HOME environment variable.

## Usage

### **Project settings in build step**

* **For existing FitNesse instance**: host and port where FitNesse is running

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/host_port.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/host_port.png)

* **For new FitNesse instance**:
  + **JDK**: selected JDK, JVM args and Java working directory
  + **Paths**: fitnesse.jar and FitNesseRoot path
  + **Fitnesse**: port use and command line args

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/jdk.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/jdk.png)

* **In all cases:**
  + Target page
  + HTTP and test timeout
  + Results file name

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/target.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/target.png)

#### **Project settings in post-build step**

* Results file name: the name of the result file ; if there is several files, you can use wildcards.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/post_build.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/post_build.png)

## Result

* On project page : a new chart with result trend and a little summary

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/chart.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/chart.png)

* All tests result in a page:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/results.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/results.png)

* And finally, captured details of a test:

## Pipeline

The plugin supports pipeline the following way:

### Run your tests

With some sample values, this step looks like this:

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseBuilder',
        options: [
        fitnessePathToRoot: "",
        additionalFitnesseOptions: "-v",  // -v for verbose
        fitnesseTestTimeout: '',
        fitnesseStart: 'true',
        fitnesseHttpTimeout: '',
        fitnesseJavaOpts: '',
        fitnessePathToJar: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/fitnesse-20180127-standalone.jar",
        fitnesseTargetPage: "suiteMyTestSuite",
        fitnessePartitionEnabled: 'false',
        fitnessePartitionCount: '2',
        fitnessePartitionIndex: '0',
        fitnessePartitionIndexFile: '',
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsOut: 'fitnesse-results.xml',
        fitnessePathToJunitResultsOut: 'fitnesse-junit-results.xml',
        fitnessePortLocal: '8083',
        fitnesseJavaWorkingDirectory: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/"
      ]])

```

### Render results

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseResultsRecorder',
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsIn: 'fitnesse-results.xml'
])

```

## Todo

* Run fitnesse tests using "-c" option when starting new fitnesse instance
* Add more control over fitnesse start-up params
* Using glob to collect (potentially) multiple results.xml files
* Nest Sub-suites and tests-within-suites within the uber-parent FitnesseResults instance
* Allow direct URL access to sub-suites and tests-within-suites so that every level can have its history graph
* Run multiple test suites from one project configuration

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass via default method parameter expression in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1710
/
CVE-2020-2109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.78 and earlier can be circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods.

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are subject to sandbox protection in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.79.

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1713
/
CVE-2020-2110**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.69 and earlier can be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to imports or by using them inside of other annotations.
This affects both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing sandboxed script validation.

Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

This issue is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1266](/security/advisory/2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266).

Script Security Plugin 1.70 disallows all known unsafe AST transformations on imports or when used inside of other annotations.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-1725
/
CVE-2020-2111**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`subversion`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion)**

**Description:**

Subversion Plugin 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the Project Repository Base URL field form validation.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to specify such base URLs, for example users able to configure Multibranch Pipelines.

Subversion Plugin 2.13.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

### Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in Git Parameter Plugin

**SECURITY-1709
/
CVE-2020-2112 (parameter name), CVE-2020-2113 (default value)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-parameter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-parameter)**

**Description:**

Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.11 and earlier does not correctly escape the parameter name or default value.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.12 escapes the parameter name and default value shown on the UI.

### Credential transmitted in plain text by S3 publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1684
/
CVE-2020-2114**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`s3`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/s3)**

**Description:**

S3 publisher Plugin stores a secret key in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.4 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

S3 publisher Plugin 0.11.5 transmits the secret key in its global configuration encrypted.

### XXE vulnerability in NUnit Plugin

**SECURITY-1752
/
CVE-2020-2115**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`nunit`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nunit)**

**Description:**

NUnit Plugin 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

NUnit Plugin 0.26 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin allows capturing credentials

**SECURITY-812 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2116 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2117 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-githubnotify-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-githubnotify-step)**

**Description:**

Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.5.

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credential IDs in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin

**SECURITY-812 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2118**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-githubnotify-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-githubnotify-step)**

**Description:**

Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Pipeline GitHub Notify Step Plugin 1.0.5 requires the permission to configure a project.

### Client secret transmitted in plain text by Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin

**SECURITY-1717
/
CVE-2020-2119**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-ad`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-ad)**

**Description:**

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stores a client secret in its global configuration.

While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin 1.1.2 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin 1.2.0 transmits the client secret in its global configuration encrypted.

### XXE vulnerability in FitNesse Plugin

**SECURITY-1751
/
CVE-2020-2120**

[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`fitnesse`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fitnesse)**

**Description:**

FitNesse Plugin 1.30 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

FitNesse Plugin 1.31 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

### RCE vulnerability in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin

**SECURITY-1731
/
CVE-2020-2121**
