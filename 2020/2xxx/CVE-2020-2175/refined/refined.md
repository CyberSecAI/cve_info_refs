Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The FitNesse Plugin for Jenkins did not properly escape report content before displaying it on the Jenkins UI. This lack of proper output sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code through the report content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the Jenkins environment and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Jenkins UI.
- This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    - Cookie theft, allowing session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the Jenkins UI.
    - Phishing attacks to trick users into entering sensitive data.
    - Other actions performed on behalf of a user if the injected script can perform actions in the context of an authenticated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the XML input files that are processed by the plugin, meaning a malicious user with the required privileges can inject the malicious script into the test reports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges within Jenkins to modify the XML input files, typically through controlling the test results input to the plugin. This usually means they need to be able to modify Jenkins jobs, or influence what test results are imported.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript into the report files which the FitNesse plugin then parses and outputs in the UI.
