SECURITY-1699 / CVE-2020-2172
Code Coverage API Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user
able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report"
post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external
entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side
request forgery.

SECURITY-1633 / CVE-2020-2173
Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that
bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins
1.641 and 1.625.3. This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

SECURITY-1769 / CVE-2020-2174
AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values
printed as part of form validation output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1801 / CVE-2020-2175
FitNesse Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents
before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the
plugin.

SECURITY-1780 / CVE-2020-2176
Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and
earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

# FitNesse

How to install

* [Documentation](/fitnesse/)
* [Releases](/fitnesse/releases/)
* [Issues](/fitnesse/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/fitnesse/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/fitnesse/healthscore/)

This plugin can be used to both execute and report on [FitNesse](http://fitnesse.org/) tests so that they can be integrated into a Jenkins build.
 Contributions are welcome, both bug fixes and new features. Just raise a pull request via GitHub.

[CI Server](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/fitnesse-plugin/)

## Configuration

### **Global**

* You could define a JDK installation (not mandatory). All JDKs will be available in the job configuration.

### **Agent node**

* If your job runs on a remote node and launches FitNesse, you should add the HOST\_NAME environment variable in the node configuration and set its value to the node’s hostname or IP. You can name it as fitnesse.yourdomain.com (whatever you like). This environment variable will be used when you set up the fitnesse instance below (it will replace localhost by the content of HOST\_NAME).

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/hostname.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/hostname.png)

Note: If you have the [EnvInject](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject/) plugin installed, Environment variables configured like in the image will not work. Use the EnvInject way instead. You will notice this by fitnesse still trying to connect to localhost, instead of the content in HOST\_NAME.

* You could also override JDK location used, by set a *Tool location*:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/tools_location.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/tools_location.png)

or by overridden JAVA\_HOME environment variable.

## Usage

### **Project settings in build step**

* **For existing FitNesse instance**: host and port where FitNesse is running

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/host_port.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/host_port.png)

* **For new FitNesse instance**:
  + **JDK**: selected JDK, JVM args and Java working directory
  + **Paths**: fitnesse.jar and FitNesseRoot path
  + **Fitnesse**: port use and command line args

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/jdk.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/jdk.png)

* **In all cases:**
  + Target page
  + HTTP and test timeout
  + Results file name

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/target.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/target.png)

#### **Project settings in post-build step**

* Results file name: the name of the result file ; if there is several files, you can use wildcards.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/post_build.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/post_build.png)

## Result

* On project page : a new chart with result trend and a little summary

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/chart.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/chart.png)

* All tests result in a page:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/results.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/results.png)

* And finally, captured details of a test:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin@master/images/details.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/fitnesse-plugin/blob/master/images/details.png)

## Pipeline

The plugin supports pipeline the following way:

### Run your tests

With some sample values, this step looks like this:

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseBuilder',
        options: [
        fitnessePathToRoot: "",
        additionalFitnesseOptions: "-v",  // -v for verbose
        fitnesseTestTimeout: '',
        fitnesseStart: 'true',
        fitnesseHttpTimeout: '',
        fitnesseJavaOpts: '',
        fitnessePathToJar: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/fitnesse-20180127-standalone.jar",
        fitnesseTargetPage: "suiteMyTestSuite",
        fitnessePartitionEnabled: 'false',
        fitnessePartitionCount: '2',
        fitnessePartitionIndex: '0',
        fitnessePartitionIndexFile: '',
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsOut: 'fitnesse-results.xml',
        fitnessePathToJunitResultsOut: 'fitnesse-junit-results.xml',
        fitnessePortLocal: '8083',
        fitnesseJavaWorkingDirectory: "/opt/var/fitnesse/lib/"
      ]])

```

### Render results

```
step([ $class: 'FitnesseResultsRecorder',
        fitnessePathToXmlResultsIn: 'fitnesse-results.xml'
])

```

## Todo

* Run fitnesse tests using "-c" option when starting new fitnesse instance
* Add more control over fitnesse start-up params
* Using glob to collect (potentially) multiple results.xml files
* Nest Sub-suites and tests-within-suites within the uber-parent FitnesseResults instance
* Allow direct URL access to sub-suites and tests-within-suites so that every level can have its history graph
* Run multiple test suites from one project configuration

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Code Coverage Plugin

**SECURITY-1699
/
CVE-2020-2172**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`code-coverage-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/code-coverage-api)**

**Description:**

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
This allows a user able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

Code Coverage Plugin 1.1.5 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### XSS vulnerability in Gatling Plugin

**SECURITY-1633
/
CVE-2020-2173**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gatling`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gatling)**

**Description:**

Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3.
This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

Gatling Plugin 1.3.0 no longer allows viewing Gatling reports directly in Jenkins.
Instead users need to download an archive containing the report.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in AWSEB Deployment Plugin

**SECURITY-1769
/
CVE-2020-2174**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`awseb-deployment-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/awseb-deployment-plugin)**

**Description:**

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values printed as part of form validation output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

AWSEB Deployment Plugin 0.3.20 escapes the values printed as part of the affected form validation endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in FitNesse Plugin

**SECURITY-1801
/
CVE-2020-2175**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fitnesse`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fitnesse)**

**Description:**

FitNesse Plugin 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the plugin.

FitNesse Plugin 1.33 escapes content from XML input files before rendering it on the Jenkins UI.

### XSS vulnerability in useMango Runner Plugin

**SECURITY-1780
/
CVE-2020-2176**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`usemango-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/usemango-runner)**

**Description:**

Multiple form validation endpoints in useMango Runner Plugin 1.4 and earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

useMango Runner Plugin 1.5 escapes all values received from the useMango service in form validation messages.
