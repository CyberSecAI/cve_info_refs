Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2126:

**CVE-2020-2126**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The DigitalOcean Plugin stores the DigitalOcean API token in plain text within the global `config.xml` file. This is a configuration vulnerability caused by the plugin's failure to properly encrypt sensitive data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of a sensitive credential (API token) in an unencrypted format.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The API token, if exposed, could be used by attackers to access the associated DigitalOcean account and resources.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially use the compromised token to create, modify or delete resources within the associated DigitalOcean account.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` file and extract the unencrypted token.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to the Jenkins Master File System:** The attacker must have the ability to browse and read files on the Jenkins controller where the configuration file resides. This could be achieved through a variety of means, such as compromised server credentials or access via other exploits on the Jenkins instance or the host machine.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in DigitalOcean Plugin version 1.1 and earlier.
*   There was no fix available at the time of the advisory publication for this vulnerability.
*   The severity is considered low since the attacker needs access to the Jenkins file system to exploit it.
