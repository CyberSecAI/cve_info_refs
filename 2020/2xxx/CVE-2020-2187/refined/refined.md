The provided content is related to CVE-2020-2187.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Amazon EC2 Plugin versions 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accept self-signed HTTPS certificates and do not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of SSL/TLS certificate validation.
- Lack of hostname validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A man-in-the-middle attack can be performed to intercept connections to build agents. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information or to inject malicious code into the build process.

**Attack Vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker would need to be positioned on the network path between the Jenkins server and the Windows agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity/ability to intercept the connection between Jenkins and Windows agent.
- Ability to spoof or manipulate network traffic to perform the MITM attack.
