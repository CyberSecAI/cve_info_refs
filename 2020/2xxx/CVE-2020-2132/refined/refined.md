Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2132:

**CVE-2020-2132**

*   **Root Cause:** The Parasoft Environment Manager Plugin stores the repository password in plain text within the job's `config.xml` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin fails to encrypt the repository password, leading to a vulnerability where the credential is stored in an insecure manner.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system or possesses "Extended Read" permissions for a job can read the unencrypted repository password. This could lead to unauthorized access to the repository and potential further compromise depending on the use of these credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
    *   Exploitation of a separate vulnerability to gain "Extended Read" permissions for the affected jobs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need either access to the Jenkins controller's file system, or "Extended Read" permissions for the affected Jenkins jobs.
