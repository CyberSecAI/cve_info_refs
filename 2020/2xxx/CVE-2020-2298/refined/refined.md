Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Nerrvana Plugin's XML parser is not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. This means the parser can be tricked into processing external entities defined in a crafted XML document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE vulnerability:** The core issue is the lack of proper configuration in the XML parser, which allows the processing of external entities.
*   **Missing POST request:** XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that does not require POST requests. This allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract secrets from the Jenkins controller by leveraging external entities to access local files.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability can be exploited to make the Jenkins controller perform requests to internal or external resources.
*   **CSRF:** The lack of a required POST request to the vulnerable endpoint means that an attacker can trick a victim's browser into sending malicious requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a malicious HTTP request with XML data containing external entities.
*   **CSRF:** The vulnerable endpoint can be accessed via a CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Overall/Read Permission (for direct exploitation):** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can send crafted XML requests directly.
*   **No specific permission (for CSRF exploitation):** An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability even without Overall/Read permission. They must be able to trick a user to visit a malicious page.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability affects Nerrvana Plugin versions 1.02.06 and earlier.
* There is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
