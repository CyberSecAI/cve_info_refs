Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2283:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Liquibase Runner Plugin fails to properly escape changeset contents when displaying them on the build page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they view the build page, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- Arbitrary code execution (as indicated by the high CVSS score)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted Liquibase changesets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide Liquibase changesets that are evaluated by the plugin. This usually means the attacker would need to be able to configure a Jenkins job/pipeline that uses the Liquibase Runner plugin.
- The attacker needs to have at least low privileges with permission to define and run jobs/pipelines.
