### Description

A buffer overflow vulnerability in PAN-OS allows an unauthenticated attacker to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges by sending a malicious request to the Captive Portal or Multi-Factor Authentication interface.

This issue impacts:

All versions of PAN-OS 8.0;

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3.

This issue does not impact the GlobalProtect VPN or the PAN-OS management web interfaces.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | None | >= 10.0.0 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.3 | >= 9.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.9 | >= 9.0.9 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.15 | >= 8.1.15 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | 8.0.\* | None |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only where either Captive Portal is enabled or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is configured as per <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-admin/authentication/configure-multi-factor-authentication.html>

### Severity: CRITICAL

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
9.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-120 Buffer Overflow](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.15, PAN-OS 9.0.9, PAN-OS 9.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

All Prisma Access services are now upgraded to resolve this issue and are no longer vulnerable.

PAN-OS 7.1 and 8.0 are end-of-life and are no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Until PAN-OS software is upgraded to a fixed version, enabling signatures in content update version 8317 will block attacks against CVE-2020-2040.
