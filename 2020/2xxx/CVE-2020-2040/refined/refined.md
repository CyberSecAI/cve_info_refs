- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in PAN-OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-120). It is triggered when processing requests to the Captive Portal or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This leads to confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the network. Attackers can send a malicious request to the Captive Portal or MFA interface to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication (unauthenticated) and can send network requests.

The vulnerability is present in all versions of PAN-OS 8.0, PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.15, PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.9, and PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than 9.1.3. It only affects systems where Captive Portal or MFA is enabled.
