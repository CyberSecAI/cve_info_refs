Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Active Directory plugin, when configured to use Windows/ADSI mode, does not specifically prohibit the use of empty passwords for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin fails to enforce a requirement for a non-empty password when authenticating users against an Active Directory server via Windows/ADSI.
*   **Unauthenticated Bind Operation:**  If the Active Directory server allows unauthenticated bind operations, this weakness becomes exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to Jenkins as any user by providing an empty password if the Active Directory server allows unauthenticated bind operations.
*   **Full Compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can potentially lead to full compromise of the Jenkins server, as well as any applications built or deployed by the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Jenkins instance and the Active Directory server.
*   **Authentication Attempts:**  Attackers attempt to log in to Jenkins with a valid username and an empty password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attacker must be able to send network requests to the Jenkins server
*   **Valid Username:** Attacker needs a valid username known to the system being attacked.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in Active Directory Plugin versions 2.19 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Windows/ADSI mode of the Active Directory plugin, not the LDAP-based mode.
*   The Active Directory server must allow unauthenticated bind operations for the exploit to succeed.
*   The fix involves prohibiting the use of empty passwords, implemented in Active Directory Plugin version 2.20.
