Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2205:

**CVE-2020-2205**

*   **Root Cause:** The VncRecorder Plugin does not properly sanitize the tool path in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed when a user views the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to be able to configure the tool path setting within the VncRecorder plugin. This setting is accessed through job configuration forms.
*  **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to have Jenkins administrator privileges.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is located in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint, which is used, for example, when configuring a job.
*   The specific part of the input not being escaped is a tool path.
* The affected versions of the VncRecorder Plugin are 1.25 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in version 1.35, which escapes the tool path.
