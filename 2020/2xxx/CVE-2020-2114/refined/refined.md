Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2114:

**CVE-2020-2114**

*   **Root Cause:** The S3 publisher plugin transmits the secret key in plain text as part of the configuration form, even though it is stored encrypted on disk.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Plaintext transmission of secret key.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of the secret key through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or similar situations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Browser extensions capturing the plaintext credential.
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that might expose the credential during configuration form transmission.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No specific attacker position is mentioned, however an attacker with the ability to observe the network traffic or have XSS capabilities against the Jenkins instance could exploit this.
    * The advisory mentions that exposure could happen through "browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations". So an attacker might not need to be authenticated to the Jenkins instance itself to leverage the issue, but would need some way to capture the data from the user while the form is being transmitted.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the S3 publisher plugin.
*   The issue is fixed in version 0.11.5 of the plugin where the secret key is transmitted encrypted.
*   The provided information offers more details than the description of CVE-2020-2114.
