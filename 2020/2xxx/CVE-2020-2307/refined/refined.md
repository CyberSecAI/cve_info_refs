Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2307:

**CVE-2020-2307**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kubernetes Plugin had a feature that allowed placeholders in pod and container template fields to be replaced with environment variable values from the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allowed substitution of environment variables, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Low-privilege users could access potentially sensitive environment variables from the Jenkins controller. This could lead to the disclosure of secrets or other sensitive information stored in environment variables.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this by crafting a pod template or container template with placeholders that would resolve to sensitive environment variables on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permission to be able to define and use pod templates that expose the environment variables.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Kubernetes Plugin versions 1.27.3 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.27.4 by disabling the environment variable substitution feature.
*   A system property (`org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.PodTemplateUtils.SUBSTITUTE_ENV`) was introduced to allow administrators to re-enable this feature if needed, though future releases of the plugin will remove the feature entirely.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was assigned a CVSS severity of medium.
