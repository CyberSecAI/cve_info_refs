Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2091:

**CVE-2020-2091:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check in the Amazon EC2 Plugin.
*   **Root Cause:** The Amazon EC2 Plugin (versions 1.47 and earlier) does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Missing permission checks on form validation methods.
    *   Form validation methods do not require POST requests, leading to CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region.
    *   Attackers can use attacker-specified credential IDs (obtained through another method) to connect to the URL.
    *   Potential to capture credentials stored in Jenkins (unconfirmed).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attack.
    *   Attacker exploits the lack of permission checks and CSRF protection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   Attacker must have obtained the necessary credential IDs through a separate method.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-2091 describes a vulnerability in the Amazon EC2 plugin where insufficient permission checks in form validation methods combined with the lack of CSRF protection enables attackers with Overall/Read access to perform actions using attacker-specified credentials, potentially leading to credential exposure and access to AWS resources within a region specified by the attacker.
