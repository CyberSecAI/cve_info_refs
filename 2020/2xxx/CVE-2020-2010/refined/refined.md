Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an OS command injection flaw in the PAN-OS management interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The system allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise, including:
    - Confidentiality Impact: High - Unauthorized disclosure of information.
    - Integrity Impact: High - Modification of system data.
    - Availability Impact: High - Disruption of services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator to exploit the vulnerability. This means having valid administrator credentials for the PAN-OS management interface.
- Low attack complexity

**Affected versions:**
- All versions of PAN-OS 7.1 and 8.0
- PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.14
- PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.7

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.14, 9.0.7, or 9.1.0, or later versions.
- Follow best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface, as described in the Palo Alto Networks documentation.

**Additional Notes:**
- PAN-OS 8.0 is end-of-life and no longer supported.
- PAN-OS 7.1 is on extended support and only considered for critical fixes.
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by Palo Alto Networks.
