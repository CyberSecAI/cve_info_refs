**Vulnerability:** Non-constant time HMAC comparison

**Root cause:** The Jenkins core did not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two HMACs were equal. This made it vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Weakness:** The usage of non-constant-time comparison algorithms, which can reveal information about secrets through timing analysis.

**Impact:** An attacker could potentially use statistical methods to obtain a valid HMAC for an attacker-controlled input value. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or control over the system.

**Attack vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to Jenkins that include an HMAC and observing the time it takes for the server to respond. By analyzing these timings, an attacker could try to guess the correct HMAC value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins server.
*   An attacker may require knowledge of some aspects of the system, such as user IDs or potentially a valid HMAC (to begin with).
*   An attacker may have a legitimate user account, but could be unauthenticated.
