Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Blue Ocean Plugin, in versions 1.23.2 and earlier, lacks permission checks in several HTTP endpoints that implement connection tests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing permission check on HTTP endpoints used for connection tests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can exploit this vulnerability to initiate connections to an attacker-specified URL. This may allow the attacker to perform actions on the target URL as though it were a trusted source, potentially leaking information or facilitating further exploitation if the target URL exposes any vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, specifically through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The original advisory incorrectly identified the problematic behavior, but this was later corrected. The HTTP requests themselves are legitimate, but the lack of authorization made the connection tests vulnerable.
- The fix in Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.3 requires Item/Create permission to perform these connection tests.
