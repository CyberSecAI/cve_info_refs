Provides [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) for Jenkins Plugins. ECharts is an open-sourced JavaScript visualization tool to create intuitive, interactive, and highly-customizable charts. It can run fluently on PC and mobile devices and it is compatible with most modern Web Browsers.

This plugin contains the JS and CSS files of the latest [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) release and corresponding Jenkins UI elements (model, view, and controller).

## How to use the plugin

A Jenkins plugin typically also reports some kind of trend from build to build. Up to now Jenkins core provides only a quite limited concept of rendering such trends as trend charts. The [JFreeChart framework](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) offered by Jenkins core is a server side rendering engine that creates charts as static PNG images that will be included on the job and details pages. Nowadays, several powerful JS based charting libraries are available, that do the same job (well actually an even better job) on the client side. That has the advantage that these charts can be customized on each client without affecting the server performance. Moreover, you get a lot of additional features (like zooming, animation, etc.) for free. Additionally, these charting libraries not only support the typical build trend charts but also a lot of additional charts types that can be used to improve the user experience of a plugin. One of those charting libraries is [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html). This library has a powerful API and supports literally every chart type one can image of. You can get some impressions of the features on the [examples page](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/) of the library.

In order to use these charts one can embed charts that use this library by importing the corresponding JS files and by defining the chart in the corresponding Jelly file. While that already works quite well it will be still somewhat cumbersome to provide the corresponding model for these charts from Jenkins build results. So I I added a powerful Java API that helps to create the model for these charts on the Java side. This API provides the following features:

* Create trend charts based on a collection of build results.
* Separate the chart type from the aggregation in order to simplify unit testing of the chart model.
* Toggle the type of the X-Axis between build number or build date (with automatic aggregation of results that have been recorded at the same day).
* Automatic conversion of the Java model to the required JSON model for the JS side.
* Support for pie and line charts (more to come soon).

Those charts can be used as trend chart in the project page (see [Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin](#plugin-content-img-trend)) or as information chart in the details view of a plugin (see [Pie chart in the Warnings plugin](#plugin-content-img-pie)).

### Pie charts

A simple but still informative chart is a pie chart that illustrates numerical proportions of plugin data. In the Forensics plugin such a chart show the numerical proportions of the number of authors or commits for the source code files in the Git repository. In the warnings plugin such a chart shows the numerical proportions of the new, outstanding, or fixed warnings, see [Pie chart in the Warnings plugin](#plugin-content-img-pie).

[![Pie chart example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin@main/etc/images/pie.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin/blob/main/etc/images/pie.png)

Figure 1. Pie chart in the Warnings plugin

In order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided `pie-chart` tag. In the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a [Bootstrap card](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bootstrap5-api-plugin)):

index.jelly

```
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core"  xmlns:c="/charts" xmlns:bs="/bootstrap">

    [...]
    <bs:card title="${%Number of authors}" fontAwesomeIcon="users">
      <c:pie-chart id="authors" model="${it.authorsModel}" height="256" />
    </bs:card>
    [...]

</j:jelly>
```

You need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON representation of a corresponding `PieChartModel` instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines:

ViewModel.java

```
[...]
PieChartModel model = new PieChartModel("Title");

model.add(new PieData("Segment 1 name", 10), Palette.RED);
model.add(new PieData("Segment 2 name", 15), Palette.GREEN);
model.add(new PieData("Segment 3 name", 20), Palette.YELLOW);

String json = new JacksonFacade().toJson(model);
[...]
```

### Progress charts

Another simple chart (that is based on a pie chart) is the progress chart. Using this chart you can render a simple progress value using a pie chart as backend.

[![Pie chart example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin@main/etc/images/progress.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin/blob/main/etc/images/progress.png)

Figure 2. Progress chart in the Autograding plugin

In order to include such a chart in your details view, you can use the provided `progress-chart` tag. In the following snippet you see this tag in action (embedded in a [Bootstrap card](https://github.com/jenkinsci/bootstrap5-api-plugin)):

index.jelly

```
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core"  xmlns:c="/charts" xmlns:bs="/bootstrap">

    [...]
    <bs:card title="${%Autograding score}" fontAwesomeIcon="graduation-cap">
      <c:progress-chart id="total-progress" model="${it.getProgressModel(80)}" height="150"
                        value="80" tooltip="80% is very good"/>
    </bs:card>
    [...]

</j:jelly>
```

You need to provide a unique ID for this chart and the corresponding model value. The model must be the JSON representation of a corresponding `PieChartModel` instance. Such a model can be created with a couple of lines, see the class [PercentagePieChart](https://github.com/jenkinsci/autograding-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/grading/PercentagePieChart.java).

### Trend charts on the job level view

In order to show a trend that renders a line chart on the job page (see [Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin](#plugin-content-img-trend)) you need to provide a so called floating box (stored in the file `floatingBox.jelly` of your job action (see [Jenkins chart model design](#plugin-content-jenkins-chart-model))). The content of this file is quite simple and contains just a `trend-chart` tag:

floatingBox.jelly

```
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:c="/charts">

  <c:trend-chart it="${from}" title="${%SCM Files Count Trend}" enableLinks="true"/>

</j:jelly>
```

On the Java side the model for the chart needs to be provided in the corresponding sub class of `JobAction` (which is the owner of the floating box). Since the computation of trend charts is quite expensive on the server side as well (several builds need to be read from disk and the interesting data points need to be computed) this process has been put into a separate background job. Once the computation is done the result is shown via an Ajax call. In order to hide these details for plugin authors you should simply derive your `JobAction` class from the corresponding `AsyncTrendJobAction` class, that already contains the boilerplate code. So your static plugin object model will actually become a little bit more complex:

[![Jenkins chart model](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin@main/etc/images/chart-model.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin/blob/main/etc/images/chart-model.png)

Figure 3. Jenkins chart model design

Basically, you need to implement the method `LinesChartModel createChartModel()` to create the line chart. This method is quite simple to implement, since most of the hard work is provided by the library. You will be invoked with an iterator of your build actions, starting with the latest build. The iterator advances from build to build until no more results are available (or the maximum number of builds to consider has been reached). The most important thing to implement in your plugin is the way how data points are computed for a given `BuildAction`. Here is an example of such a `SeriesBuilder` implementation in the Forensics Plugin:

FilesCountSeriesBuilder.java

```
package io.jenkins.plugins.forensics.miner;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

import edu.hm.hafner.echarts.SeriesBuilder;

/**
 * Builds one x-axis point for the series of a line chart showing the number of files in the repository.
 *
 * @author Ullrich Hafner
 */
public class FilesCountSeriesBuilder extends SeriesBuilder<ForensicsBuildAction> {
    static final String TOTALS_KEY = "total";

    @Override
    protected Map<String, Integer> computeSeries(final ForensicsBuildAction current) {
        Map<String, Integer> series = new HashMap<>();
        series.put(TOTALS_KEY, current.getNumberOfFiles());
        return series;
    }
}
```

You are not limited to a single line chart. You can show several lines in a single chart, you can show stacked values, or even the delta between some values. You can also have a look at the [charts of the warnings plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/tree/master/plugin/src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/analysis/core/charts) to see some of these features in detail.

[![Trend with several lines example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin@main/etc/images/trend-lines.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin/blob/main/etc/images/trend-lines.png)

Figure 4. Trend chart with several lines in the Warnings plugin

[![Trend chart with stacked lines example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin@main/etc/images/trend-stacked.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/echarts-api-plugin/blob/main/etc/images/trend-stacked.png)

Figure 5. Trend chart with stacked lines in the Warnings plugin

You can find several examples of Jenkins views that use ECharts in the [Warnings Next Generation plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin) and in the [Forensics plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin).

## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1866
/
CVE-2020-2190**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

Script Security Plugin 1.73 escapes pending and approved classpath entries before rendering them in the Jenkins UI.

### CSRF vulnerability and improper permission checks in Swarm Plugin

**SECURITY-1200
/
CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks), CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels.
In Swarm Plugin 3.20 and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed.
This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Swarm Plugin 3.21 requires POST requests and Agent/Configure permission for the affected agent to these endpoints.
It no longer uses the global Swarm secret for these API endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1841
/
CVE-2020-2193**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the parser identifier.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1842
/
CVE-2020-2194**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the display name.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Compact Columns Plugin

**SECURITY-1837
/
CVE-2020-2195**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compact-columns`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compact-columns)**

**Description:**

Compact Columns Plugin 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job description in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Compact Columns Plugin 1.12 applies the configured markup formatter to the job description shown in tooltips.

### Complete lack of CSRF protection in Selenium Plugin can lead to OS command injection

**SECURITY-1766
/
CVE-2020-2196**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`selenium`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/selenium)**

**Description:**

Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result in OS command injection on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin

**SECURITY-1582
/
CVE-2020-2197 (permission check), CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission.
Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.

Project Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.

Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XSS vulnerability in Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin

**SECURITY-1726
/
CVE-2020-2199**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`svn-partial-release-mgr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/svn-partial-release-mgr)**

**Description:**

Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### OS command injection vulnerability in Play Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1879
/
CVE-2020-2200**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`play-autotest-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/play-autotest-plugin)**

**Description:**

A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.

Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins controller.
This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins controller (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1866 / CVE-2020-2190
Script Security Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending
or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

SECURITY-1200 / CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks) & CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin adds API endpoints to add or
remove agent labels. In Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin 3.20
and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular
permission check is performed. This allows users with Agent/Create
permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1841 / CVE-2020-2193
ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser
identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1842 / CVE-2020-2194
ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of
the builds in the trend chart.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1837 / CVE-2020-2195
Compact Columns Plugin 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job
description in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1766 / CVE-2020-2196
Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP
endpoints.

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result
in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1582 / CVE-2020-2197 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)
Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users
with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure
permission. Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features,
including the API URL `/job/.../getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project
job type that does something similar.

Project Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions
for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to
every user with Job/Read permission.

Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job
configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API
for users without Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1726 / CVE-2020-2199
Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape
the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1879 / CVE-2020-2200
A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play`
command to validate a given input file.

Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the
`play` command on the Jenkins master. This results in an OS command
injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on
the Jenkins master (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
