Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2193:

**Root Cause:**

The ECharts API Plugin, in versions 4.7.0-3 and earlier, fails to properly sanitize the parser identifier when rendering charts. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious code injected via the parser identifier is stored and executed within the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected chart.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, allowing for a wide range of malicious actions:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information visible to the user
    - **UI Manipulation:** Modifying the appearance of the page or redirecting users to malicious sites
    - **Arbitrary Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user within Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when rendering a chart that incorporates an unsanitized parser identifier within the plugin.
- **Stored XSS:**  The malicious payload is stored within Jenkins' configuration, likely through a job configuration and is activated every time the chart is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Job/Configure Permission:** An attacker needs to have Job/Configure permissions to modify the job configuration and inject malicious code. This implies a user with some degree of access to the Jenkins environment.
