Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2256:

**CVE-2020-2256**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin fails to properly escape the display name of an upstream job when it's included as part of a build cause. This means that if an attacker controls the display name of an upstream job, they can inject malicious scripts.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/encoding of the upstream job's display name.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the Jenkins web interface. This code could be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of a victim user.
    *   Deface the Jenkins UI.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker configures a Jenkins job with a malicious display name.
    *   This job is then triggered as an upstream build for another job using the Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin.
    *   The malicious display name is not properly escaped in the build cause, leading to the injection of the script.
    *   When a user views the build cause of the downstream job, the stored XSS vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have `Job/Configure` permissions on a Jenkins job that will act as an upstream job.
    *   The attacker needs to know (or be able to trigger) a downstream job that uses the Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin and displays the upstream job in the build cause.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin version 3.9.3, which escapes upstream job names in build causes.
*   The provided content includes a detailed description of the plugin, its features and how to configure and use it.
