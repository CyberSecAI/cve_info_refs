Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2204:

**CVE-2020-2204**

*   **Root Cause:** The Fortify on Demand Plugin versions 5.0.1 and earlier lack proper permission checks on a method used for form validation.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read access can connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs that they have obtained through a separate method (CVE-2020-2202). This allows an attacker to potentially perform actions within the Fortify on Demand system using the targeted credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a request to the form validation method in the Fortify on Demand Plugin.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance and has obtained valid credential IDs from CVE-2020-2202.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The same advisory also mentions a related CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-2203) affecting the same form validation method. This vulnerability exists because the form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   The fix for this issue is included in Fortify on Demand Plugin version 6.0.0, which now requires appropriate permissions for the form validation method.
