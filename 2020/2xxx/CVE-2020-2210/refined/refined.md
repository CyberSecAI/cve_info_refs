Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2210:

**CVE-2020-2210**

*   **Root Cause:** The Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file. While stored encrypted on disk, the plugin transmits the password in plain text as part of the configuration form.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Plaintext transmission of password.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of the Stash API password. This can occur via browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The password is exposed when it is transmitted in plain text during the configuration form submission.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs to be able to intercept the plain text password transmitted during form submission. This could be done via browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or by network sniffing.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Stash Branch Parameter Plugin versions 0.3.0 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability only affects Jenkins before 2.236, because Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.
*   There is no fix for this vulnerability as of the publication date of the advisory.
