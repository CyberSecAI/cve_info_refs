Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2278:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Storable Configs Plugin allows users to store copies of a job's `config.xml` on the Jenkins controller using a user-specified filename.
- The plugin does not properly validate or restrict the provided filename, only appending a `.xml` suffix if one is not already present.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary file write:** The lack of filename validation allows an attacker to overwrite any `.xml` file on the Jenkins controller with the contents of a job's `config.xml`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can overwrite arbitrary `.xml` files on the Jenkins controller, potentially leading to:
    - Modification of Jenkins configurations
    - Injection of malicious configurations
    - Other disruptions depending on the specific overwritten file

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker exploits the vulnerability by using the Storable Configs Plugin to save a job's `config.xml` file with a filename targeting a critical `.xml` file on the Jenkins controller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs "Job/Configure" permission to modify the settings of a job which can use the Storable Configs Plugin.

**Additional details:**
- The plugin will add the `.xml` suffix if it is not already provided
- The vulnerability affects Storable Configs Plugin version 1.0 and earlier.
- There is no fix available as of the publication of the advisory.
