Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper output sanitization in the Matrix Project Plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not escape node names displayed in tooltips on the overview page of builds with a single axis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input (node names) is rendered in the web interface without proper escaping, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful XSS exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:

*   Session hijacking
*   Stealing cookies or other sensitive information
*   Defacing the website
*   Redirecting the victim to a malicious site
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the tooltips displayed on the overview page of single-axis builds within the Matrix Project plugin. The attacker needs to configure a node name that contains malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs the following capabilities:

*   **Agent/Configure permission:** The attacker must have the permission to configure agents (nodes) in Jenkins. This allows them to set a malicious node name containing the XSS payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the tooltips on the overview page of a single-axis build within the Matrix Project Plugin for the XSS payload to be executed in their browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Matrix Project Plugin and affects versions 1.16 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in version 1.17 of the plugin, which properly escapes node names.
*   This vulnerability is addressed in Jenkins Security Advisory 2020-07-15.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is High, indicating a significant risk.
