Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2242:

**CVE-2020-2242**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The database Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access can connect to an attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified credentials (username and password).
    *   The form validation method does not require POST requests, allowing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker could also use a CSRF attack by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site.

**Summary**
CVE-2020-2242 is caused by a missing permission check in the Database Plugin for Jenkins. It allows an attacker with "Overall/Read" permissions to connect to an arbitrary database server with attacker-provided credentials. The lack of POST request validation also makes this exploitable via CSRF attacks.
