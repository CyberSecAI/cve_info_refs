Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-2267:

**CVE-2020-2267**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** MongoDB Plugin
*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission checks in methods implementing form validation. These methods also do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The MongoDB Plugin does not perform proper permission checks in form validation methods.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Form validation methods do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with Overall/Read permission can gain access to some metadata of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious request due to the lack of permission checks in the form validation methods.
    *   The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to induce a victim into making a request to the Jenkins server, potentially exposing file metadata.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attackers require Overall/Read permission to access some metadata of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller due to the missing permission checks.
    *   No special network position is required, the attacker can be remote.
    *   A victim needs to interact with a malicious link in order to trigger the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also mentions that there is no fix available for the MongoDB Plugin as of the publication of the advisory.
*   The advisory also notes that CVE-2020-2267 is related to a missing permission check in the MongoDB plugin and CVE-2020-2268 is related to the CSRF vulnerability also in the MongoDB plugin.
