**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers require the ability to influence or modify Valgrind XML report content.
- They must have at least 'Job/Configure' permission, which allows them to create or modify Jenkins jobs.
- The user needs to view the report within the Jenkins UI to trigger the XSS

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Valgrind Plugin versions 0.28 and earlier.
