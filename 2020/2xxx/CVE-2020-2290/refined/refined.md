Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Active Choices Plugin versions 2.4 and earlier fail to properly escape `List` and `Map` return values from sandboxed scripts used within the *Reactive Reference Parameter*. This is caused by an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-470).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application. This XSS is stored, meaning the payload is saved and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the Jenkins interface. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Potentially compromise the Jenkins server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Job Configuration:** An attacker with `Job/Configure` permission can inject malicious code through the `List` or `Map` return values of sandboxed scripts within the configuration of a job's *Reactive Reference Parameter*.
*   **User Interaction:** When a user views the job configuration page or uses a job with the compromised parameter, the stored XSS payload will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Job/Configure permission:** An attacker needs to have the ability to configure jobs within the Jenkins instance. This permission is required to modify the vulnerable settings.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects the *Reactive Reference Parameter* specifically when using sandboxed scripts.
*   The fix in Active Choices Plugin version 2.5 ensures that all legal return values from sandboxed scripts are properly escaped, preventing the XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS, making it a more severe issue as the attack is persistent.
