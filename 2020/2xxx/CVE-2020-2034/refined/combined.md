**internally**
### Description

An OS Command Injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS GlobalProtect portal allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. An attacker would require some level of specific information about the configuration of an impacted firewall or perform brute-force attacks to exploit this issue. This issue cannot be exploited if the GlobalProtect portal feature is not enabled.

This issue impacts PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 and PAN-OS 7.1.

Prisma Access services are not impacted by this vulnerability. Firewalls that were upgraded to the latest versions of PAN-OS to resolve CVE-2020-2021 are not vulnerable to this issue.

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.3 | >= 9.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.9 | >= 9.0.9 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.15 | >= 8.1.15 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | 8.0.\* | None |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | 7.1.\* | None |

### Required Configuration for Exposure

This issue is applicable only where GlobalProtect portal is enabled.

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.1 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-78 OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.15, PAN-OS 9.0.9, PAN-OS 9.1.3, and all later PAN-OS versions.

PAN-OS 7.1 and PAN-OS 8.0 are end-of-life (as of June 30, 2020 and October 31, 2019 respectively) and are no longer covered by our Product Security Assurance policies.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Until PAN-OS software is upgraded to a fixed version, enabling signatures for Unique Threat ID 58658 on traffic destined for the GlobalProtect portal will block attacks against CVE-2020-2034.

### Acknowledgments

This issue was found by Yamata Li of Palo Alto Networks during internal security review.
