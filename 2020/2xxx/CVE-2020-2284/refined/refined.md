Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Liquibase Runner Plugin, in versions 1.4.5 and earlier, does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The plugin's failure to properly configure its XML parser allows for the processing of external entities in XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract secrets from the Jenkins controller by exploiting the XXE vulnerability and parsing a crafted XML file.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability could enable attackers to perform server-side request forgery by using external entities to make requests to other internal or external systems, expanding the attack surface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to provide Liquibase changesets that will be processed by the vulnerable plugin. The changesets must contain malicious XML content with external entity definitions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must have the ability to provide Liquibase changesets that will be processed by the Liquibase Runner Plugin. This typically implies having some level of access to Jenkins and the ability to define or modify jobs that utilize the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Liquibase Runner Plugin 1.4.7 by no longer parsing Liquibase changesets.
