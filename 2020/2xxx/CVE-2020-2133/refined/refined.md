Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2133:

**CVE-2020-2133**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Applatix Plugin stores the Applatix password in plain text within the job's `config.xml` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The plugin does not encrypt or hash the Applatix password before storing it, making it readable by anyone with access to the file or with the necessary permissions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller file system or have Extended Read permissions on the job can extract the Applatix password.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system can locate and read the `config.xml` files.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permissions for a job can view the contents of the job's `config.xml` file, and thus the plaintext password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must either have access to the Jenkins controller's file system or possess "Extended Read" permissions on the affected Jenkins job.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the Applatix plugin (CVE-2020-2133) involves the storage of the Applatix password in plaintext within job configuration files. This lack of encryption exposes the password to unauthorized individuals with file system access or the specific Jenkins permissions, potentially allowing them to compromise the related Applatix service.
