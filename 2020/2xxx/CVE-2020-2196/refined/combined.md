Subject: Re: Browser-mediated attacks on WebDriver servers

Hi,

 > * Selenium server/Grid CSRF vulnerability;
 > * Selenium server/Grid DNS-rebinding vulnerability.

I have tried requesting CVE IDs for those three times (first request was
done in 2021-06-12) and failed so far.

All three attempts were rejected for the following reasons:

 > The Jenkins CNA is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to
 > vulnerabilities in this product. Please contact the Jenkins CNA
 > to get a CVE ID assigned to this issue.

However, as a far as I understand this not the case. Here is the scope
of the Jenkins CNA [1]:

 > The Jenkins project is a CVE Numbers Authority (CNA) for Jenkins
 > and Jenkins plugins published by the Jenkins project (listed
 > on plugins.jenkins.io and/or hosted in the jenkinsci
 > GitHub organization). This means that the Jenkins project assigns
 > CVE IDs for vulnerabilities in these components.

A Selenium plugin [2,3] in indeed included in the list of Jenkins
plugins. This plugin includes [4] selenium-standalone-server but is
different from selenium-standalone-server [5] itself.

I asked the Jenkins CNA:

 > I have been redirected to you by MITRE concerning the allocation of
 > CVE IDs for several vulnerabilities in Selenium standalone server /
 > Selenium Grid [...]
 >
 > I believe this is a mistake as I do not see any clue indicating
 > that Jenkins CNA might be responsible for assigning CVE IDs

Here is the answer from the Jenkins CNA:

 > You are correct: Selenium is not in the scope of the Jenkins CNA.
 > That said, we assigned CVE IDs in the past for Jenkins plugins
 > integrating Jenkins and Selenium in some way (CVE-2021-21672,
 > CVE-2020-2196). Those are in our scope. Perhaps this is the source
 > of the confusion?

In my third CVE request attempt, I explicitly stated:

 > [Additional Information]
 > This was previously reported and denied with the following reason:
 >
 > > The Jenkins CNA is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to
 > > vulnerabilities in this product. Please contact the Jenkins CNA to

 > > integrating Jenkins and Selenium in some way (CVE-2021-21672,
 > > CVE-2020-2196). Those are in our scope. Perhaps this is the
 > > source of the confusion?

However, the request is still rejected for the same reason.

Any idea how to proceed from there?

# Selenium

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Complete lack of CSRF protection can lead to OS command injection](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-06-03/#SECURITY-1766)**This plugin is up for adoption!** We are looking for new maintainers. Visit our [Adopt a Plugin](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/) initiative for more information.

* [Dependencies](/selenium/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/selenium/healthscore/)

![(warning)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/selenium/docs/images/warning.svg)
This plugin requires Jenkins to run under Java 8 or later as of version
3.1.0
![(warning)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/selenium/docs/images/warning.svg)

This plugin turns your Jenkins cluster into a [Selenium3
Grid](https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/wiki) cluster, so that you
can utilize your heterogeneous Jenkins clusters to carry out Selenium
tests. It now has configurations to really specify the capabilities of
each node so it won't fail your tests when a node is started with
incompatible capabilities.

## Selenium Grid deployment on Jenkins cluster

This plugin sets up Selenium Grid in the following way

* On master, Selenium Grid Hub is started on port 4444, unless
  configured otherwise in Jenkins global configurations. This is where
  all your tests should connect to.
* For each slave, necessary binaries are copied and Selenium RCs are
  started.
* RCs and the Selenium Grid Hub are hooked up together automatically.

Grid can also accept additional nodes launched outside Jenkins.

## Connecting to Selenium Grid

When you run selenium tests in stand-alone Selenium, you specify the
type of the browser in the constructor.

```
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://jenkins.mydomain:4444/wd/hub"), capability);

```

In addition to standard platform matching capability offered
out-of-the-box by Selenium Grid, Jenkins allows you to specify
"jenkins.label" as a capability, whose value is an expression of label
names to narrow down where to run the tests. See the following example:

```
DesiredCapabilities capability = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
// say you use the redhat5 label to indicate RHEL5 and the amd64 label to specify the architecture
capability.setCapability("jenkins.label","redhat5 && amd64");
// Say you want a specific node to thread your request, just specify the node name (it must be running a selenium configuration though)
capability.setCapability("jenkins.nodeName","(master)");

```

These capabilities are matched by a custom capability matcher.

### Connecting from Selenium 1 client

Selenium 1 clients can connect to this via the following syntax:

```
new DefaultSelenium("jenkins.mydomain", 4444, "*firefox", 'http://amazon.com');

```

Due to the underlying code change in Selenium, this plugin no longer
allows Selenium1 clients to do label-based capability matching like the
previous versions. If this is important, please use [the selenium plugin
1.5](https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/selenium/), which
is the last version that shipped with Selenium Grid 1, which supported
the **"LABEL[&LABEL&...]:BROWSER"** syntax in the browser field to
select nodes via labels.

| browser string | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \*iexplore | Pick an available slave randomly, and run IE there. Since there's no guarantee that the randomly selected slave can actually run IE, this way of specifying a browser is unreliable unless all your slaves are Windows. |
| windows:\*iexplore | Pick an available slave that has the 'windows' label randomly, and run IE. This gives you assurance that IE will be executable |
| windows&32bit:\*firefox | Run Firefox on a node that has both 'windows' and '32bit' labels |

The "BROWSER" portion is passed as-is to the selenium RC. For valid
values, see
[this](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities).

## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1866
/
CVE-2020-2190**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

Script Security Plugin 1.73 escapes pending and approved classpath entries before rendering them in the Jenkins UI.

### CSRF vulnerability and improper permission checks in Swarm Plugin

**SECURITY-1200
/
CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks), CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels.
In Swarm Plugin 3.20 and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed.
This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Swarm Plugin 3.21 requires POST requests and Agent/Configure permission for the affected agent to these endpoints.
It no longer uses the global Swarm secret for these API endpoints.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1841
/
CVE-2020-2193**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the parser identifier.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in ECharts API Plugin

**SECURITY-1842
/
CVE-2020-2194**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`echarts-api`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api)**

**Description:**

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-4 escapes the display name.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Compact Columns Plugin

**SECURITY-1837
/
CVE-2020-2195**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compact-columns`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compact-columns)**

**Description:**

Compact Columns Plugin 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job description in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Compact Columns Plugin 1.12 applies the configured markup formatter to the job description shown in tooltips.

### Complete lack of CSRF protection in Selenium Plugin can lead to OS command injection

**SECURITY-1766
/
CVE-2020-2196**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`selenium`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/selenium)**

**Description:**

Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result in OS command injection on the Jenkins controller.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin

**SECURITY-1582
/
CVE-2020-2197 (permission check), CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission.
Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.

Project Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.

Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XSS vulnerability in Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin

**SECURITY-1726
/
CVE-2020-2199**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`svn-partial-release-mgr`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/svn-partial-release-mgr)**

**Description:**

Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### OS command injection vulnerability in Play Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1879
/
CVE-2020-2200**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`play-autotest-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/play-autotest-plugin)**

**Description:**

A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.

Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins controller.
This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins controller (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1866 / CVE-2020-2190
Script Security Plugin 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending
or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

SECURITY-1200 / CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks) & CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin adds API endpoints to add or
remove agent labels. In Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin 3.20
and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular
permission check is performed. This allows users with Agent/Create
permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1841 / CVE-2020-2193
ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser
identifier when rendering charts.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1842 / CVE-2020-2194
ECharts API Plugin 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of
the builds in the trend chart.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1837 / CVE-2020-2195
Compact Columns Plugin 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job
description in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1766 / CVE-2020-2196
Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP
endpoints.

This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

* Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
* Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
* Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result
in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1582 / CVE-2020-2197 (permission check) & CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)
Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users
with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure
permission. Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features,
including the API URL `/job/.../getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project
job type that does something similar.

Project Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions
for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to
every user with Job/Read permission.

Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job
configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API
for users without Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1726 / CVE-2020-2199
Subversion Partial Release Manager Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape
the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1879 / CVE-2020-2200
A form validation endpoint in Play Framework Plugin executes the `play`
command to validate a given input file.

Play Framework Plugin 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the
`play` command on the Jenkins master. This results in an OS command
injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on
the Jenkins master (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
