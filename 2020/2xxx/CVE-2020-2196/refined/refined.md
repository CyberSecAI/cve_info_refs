Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Selenium Plugin for Jenkins lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on its HTTP endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The plugin's HTTP endpoints do not validate the origin of requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to:
- Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
- Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
- Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.
- Execute arbitrary OS commands on the Jenkins controller through manipulated configuration parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious requests that are sent to the Jenkins server.
- An attacker could trick a logged-in Jenkins user into triggering these malicious requests through a compromised website or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in Jenkins user to perform actions that trigger the malicious requests.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can lead to OS command injection if malicious configurations are used, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Jenkins controller.
- The advisory states that at the time of publication, no fix is available.
- The affected plugin version is Selenium Plugin 3.141.59 and earlier.
