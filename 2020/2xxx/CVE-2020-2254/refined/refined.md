Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2254:

**Root Cause:**
- The Blue Ocean Plugin had an undocumented feature flag, `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE`. When set to `clone`, it allowed the plugin to read files from the Jenkins controller filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The feature flag, when enabled, allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability since the attacker could manipulate the path to access files outside of intended directories.
- **Undocumented Feature:** The feature was not documented which made it more difficult to discover and potentially to implement securely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could read sensitive files on the Jenkins controller's filesystem, potentially revealing configuration data, secrets, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request with flag enabled:** The vulnerability was triggered by setting the `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE` flag to "clone" during a REST API call to the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Item/Configure or Item/Create permission:** The attacker needed to have the permission to configure or create items within Jenkins, which allows the attacker to modify pipeline configurations where the flag can be set to `clone`.
- **Access to the Jenkins instance:** The attacker needed to have network access to the Jenkins instance.
