* [Releases](/blueocean/releases/)
* [Issues](/blueocean/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/blueocean/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/blueocean/healthscore/)

## What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean rethinks the Jenkins user experience. Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle jobs, Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of your team through the following key features:

* **Sophisticated visualizations of CD pipelines** for fast and intuitive comprehension of software pipeline status.
* **Pipeline editor** that makes automating CD pipelines approachable by guiding the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a pipeline.
* **Personalization** of the Jenkins UI to suit the role-based needs of each member of the DevOps team.
* **Pinpoint precision** when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. The Blue Ocean UI shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.
* **Native integration for branch and pull requests** enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

Note that the ***Blue Ocean*** plugin is the only one that you need to install from the Jenkins Update Center.

[Learn more](https://jenkins.io/projects/blueocean/)

| Note | Blue Ocean status   Blue Ocean will not receive further functionality updates. Blue Ocean will continue to provide easy-to-use Pipeline visualization, but it will not be enhanced further. It will only receive selective updates for significant security issues or functional defects.   Alternative options for Pipeline visualization, such as the [Pipeline: Stage View](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-stage-view/) and [Pipeline Graph View](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/) plugins, are available and offer some of the same functionality. While not complete replacements for Blue Ocean, contributions are encouraged from the community for continued development of these plugins.   The [Pipeline syntax snippet generator](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator) assists users as they define Pipeline steps with their arguments. It is the preferred tool for Jenkins Pipeline creation, as it provides online help for the Pipeline steps available in your Jenkins controller. It uses the plugins installed on your Jenkins controller to generate the Pipeline syntax. Refer to the [Pipeline steps reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/) page for information on all available Pipeline steps. |

## Running behind a proxy? Read this

In some cases proxies can rewrite URIs that have encoding in them and break web apps.

* **For apache** - please follow [this guide](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Running%2BJenkins%2Bbehind%2BApache) very carefully, especially the bit about nocanon
* **For nginx** - please see [this](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Running%2BJenkins%2Bbehind%2BNginx). Generally if you use proxy\_pass directly to the Jenkins port, you are ok, otherwise [see this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28684300/nginx-pass-proxy-subdirectory-without-url-decoding/37584637#37584637).

  + If you still have problems with some blue ocean URIs, you can use a proxy\_pass directive like this:

    ```
    if ($request_uri ~* "/blue(/.*)") \{ proxy_pass
    http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_JENKINS_PORT/blue$1; break; }
    ```

## Running Jenkins with BlueOcean on Apache Tomcat? Read this

In case you are using Apache Tomcat to serve Jenkins, you will need to make sure that you have configured Tomcat to use the following parameters:

```
-Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true
-Dorg.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH=true
```

## NOTE: Upgrading to a new version

The best way is update the main "Blue Ocean" plugin - it will then upgrade all the dependent plugins and libraries for you. Do not upgrade just one blue ocean plugin at a time, it works best if they are all kept up to date.

## Descriptions

### Missing hostname validation in Mailer Plugin

**SECURITY-1813
/
CVE-2020-2252**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Mailer Plugin 1.32.1 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
In Mailer Plugin 1.32 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.

In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` on startup.

### Missing hostname validation in Email Extension Plugin

**SECURITY-1851
/
CVE-2020-2253**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`email-ext`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/email-ext)**

**Description:**

Email Extension Plugin 2.75 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

Email Extension Plugin 2.76 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
In Email Extension Plugin 2.75 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.
Alternatively, this protection can be enabled (or disabled in the new version) via the 'Advanced Email Properties' field in the plugin’s configuration in Configure System.

In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` using either method.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Blue Ocean Plugin

**SECURITY-1956
/
CVE-2020-2254**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.2 and earlier provides an undocumented feature flag, `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE`, that when set to the value `clone` allows an attacker with Item/Configure or Item/Create permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.3 no longer includes this feature and redirects existing usage to a safer alternative.

### Missing permission check in Blue Ocean Plugin

**SECURITY-1961
/
CVE-2020-2255**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

**Updated 2020-09-16:** *This entry previously misidentified the problematic behavior. The HTTP request itself is legitimate, but only authorized users should be able to perform it.*

Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints implementing connection tests.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.3 requires Item/Create permission to perform these connection tests.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in upstream cause in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1976
/
CVE-2020-2256**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-maven`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-maven)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.9.2 and earlier does not escape the upstream job’s display name shown as part of a build cause.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.9.3 escapes upstream job names in build causes.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Validating String Parameter Plugin

**SECURITY-1935
/
CVE-2020-2257**

**Description:**

Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.4 and earlier does not escape regular expressions in tooltips.
Additionally, Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.4 does not escape parameter names and parameter descriptions.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

Validating String Parameter Plugin 2.5 escapes regular expressions in tooltips and parameter names.
Parameter descriptions are rendered using the configured markup formatter.

### Incorrect permission check in Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin

**SECURITY-1998
/
CVE-2020-2258**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-jenkins-advisor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)**

**Description:**
