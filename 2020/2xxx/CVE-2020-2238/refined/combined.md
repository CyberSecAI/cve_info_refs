# Valgrind

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[XXE vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-09-01/#SECURITY-1829)**
* **[Stored XSS vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-09-01/#SECURITY-1830)**

* [Documentation](/valgrind/)
* [Releases](/valgrind/releases/)
* [Issues](/valgrind/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/valgrind/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/valgrind/healthscore/)

Integrates [Valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org/) in Jenkins.This Plugin
integrates [Valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org/) (memcheck to be exact)
into Jenkins by providing:

* Valgrind Runner: to run valgrind with your executables
* Valgrind Publisher: to record valgrind xml reports

Those two things work independently from each other. So if your build
system already calls valgrind (as part of your unit tests or whatever)
just use the publisher to record and analyze the xml reports.

Feedback, bug reports and feature requests are highly appreciated, just
create a JIRA issue or drop me a email.

# Git Parameter

How to install

* [Documentation](/git-parameter/)
* [Releases](/git-parameter/releases/)
* [Issues](/git-parameter/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/git-parameter/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/git-parameter/healthscore/)

This plugin allows you to assign git branch, tag, pull request or revision number as parameter in your builds.

**Important!** There is no need to set up anything special in plugin settings. *This plugin will read GIT SCM configuration from your projects.* This plugin used directly the [Git Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git/) and [Git Client Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client/).

## Basic configuration

#### Project configuration

[![project configuration image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin@master/docs/images/image2018-9-20_22-0-7.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/image2018-9-20_22-0-7.png)

#### [Build with Parameters](http://xps15:8083/job/git_parameter/build?delay=0sec) form

[![Build with Parameters image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin@master/docs/images/image2018-9-20_22-2-47.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/image2018-9-20_22-2-47.png)

## Example pipeline script

**Important!** Works with version 0.9.4 or greater

#### Branch type - Basic usage

* Declarative Pipeline

```
// Using git without checkout
pipeline {
  agent any
  parameters {
    gitParameter branchFilter: 'origin/(.*)', defaultValue: 'master', name: 'BRANCH', type: 'PT_BRANCH'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Example') {
      steps {
        git branch: "${params.BRANCH}", url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Scripted Pipeline

```
properties([
    parameters([
        gitParameter(branch: '',
                     branchFilter: 'origin/(.*)',
                     defaultValue: 'master',
                     description: '',
                     name: 'BRANCH',
                     quickFilterEnabled: false,
                     selectedValue: 'NONE',
                     sortMode: 'NONE',
                     tagFilter: '*',
                     type: 'PT_BRANCH')
    ])
])
node {
    git branch: "${params.BRANCH}", url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git'
}
```

###### Important settings:

* It should be set a `default` value because initial build must get this information
* Using `git` should be set a `branchFilter` as `*origin/(.\*)*` (origin is a remote server name)

###### Parameter type

* `PT_TAG`
* `PT_BRANCH`
* `PT_BRANCH_TAG`
* `PT_REVISION`
* `PT_PULL_REQUEST`

**Important!**   If you need to use other type (other then branch) parameter, you must use git within `checkout`

#### Tag type

```
// Using git within checkout
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter name: 'TAG',
                     type: 'PT_TAG',
                     defaultValue: 'master'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                          branches: [[name: "${params.TAG}"]],
                          doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,
                          extensions: [],
                          gitTool: 'Default',
                          submoduleCfg: [],
                          userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git']]
                        ])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Branch Tag type

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter name: 'BRANCH_TAG',
                     type: 'PT_BRANCH_TAG',
                     defaultValue: 'master'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                          branches: [[name: "${params.BRANCH_TAG}"]],
                          doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,
                          extensions: [],
                          gitTool: 'Default',
                          submoduleCfg: [],
                          userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git']]
                        ])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Revision type

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter name: 'REVISION',
                     type: 'PT_REVISION',
                     defaultValue: 'master'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                          branches: [[name: "${params.REVISION}"]],
                          doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,
                          extensions: [],
                          gitTool: 'Default',
                          submoduleCfg: [],
                          userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git']]
                        ])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Pull Request type

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter name: 'PULL_REQUESTS',
                     type: 'PT_PULL_REQUEST',
                     defaultValue: '1',
                     sortMode: 'DESCENDING_SMART'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM',
                branches: [[name: "pr/${params.PULL_REQUESTS}/head"]],
                doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false,
                extensions: [],
                gitTool: 'Default',
                submoduleCfg: [],
                userRemoteConfigs: [[refspec: '+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*', url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin.git']]])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Options

#### Parameter Type

Name using in pipeline

```
type: 'PT_TAG' or 'PT_BRANCH' or 'PT_BRANCH_TAG' or 'PT_REVISION' or 'PT_PULL_REQUEST'
```

Explains about PT\_TAG or PT\_BRANCH or PT\_BRANCH\_TAG:

Plugin using [git ls-remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-remote.html) command to get remote tags or branches, this solution was implemented in  [JENKINS-40232](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-40232).

In code plugin [use](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/9f2a3ec48e699222ce3034dfe14cdb319e563ed5/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/GitClient.java#L631)ing  getRemoteReferences from GitClient, look implementation in [CliGitAPIImpl](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/CliGitAPIImpl.java).

```
package org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient
//...

public interface GitClient {
//...
    Map<String, ObjectId> getRemoteReferences(String remoteRepoUrl, String pattern, boolean headsOnly, boolean tagsOnly) throws GitException, InterruptedException;
//...
}
```

#### Branch

Name using in pipeline

```
branch
```

#### Branch Filter

Name using in pipeline

```
branchFilter
```

#### Tag Filter

Name using in pipeline

```
tagFilter
```

#### Sort Mode

Name using in pipeline

```
sortMode: 'NONE' or 'ASCENDING_SMART' or 'DESCENDING_SMART' or 'ASCENDING' or 'DESCENDING'
```

You can select the following sorting options for tags/revision/branches/branches\_or\_tags/pull requests

* none
* descending
* ascending
* ascending smart
* descending smart

For the smart variants the compare treats a sequence of digits as a single character. Contributed by Graeme Hill.

#### Default Value

Name using in pipeline

```
defaultValue
```

In release 0.9.9 or later it is good to set a default value, because this value is using the initial build (in Pipeline). Default value is returned when some error occurred on getting data.

[![default value](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin@master/docs/images/image2019-2-16_22-46-54.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/image2019-2-16_22-46-54.png)

#### Selected Value

Name using in pipeline

```
selectedValue: 'NONE' or 'TOP' or 'DEFAULT'
```

#### Use repository

Name using in pipeline

```
useRepository
```

**Remember!** You don't set a git repository into the plugin, this plugin using git repositories which are defined in project in SCM section!

If in the task are defined multiple repositories, this option specifies which the repository is taken into account on getting data. *If the option is not defined, is taken a first defined repository.* This option is a regular expression, which is compared to the 'Repository URL'.

You can define the multiple SCM for few way, you can use [Multiple SCMs Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/multiple-scms/), specified many 'Repository URL' in one SCM  or define them in pipeline.

Consider an example based on two repositories:

* <https://github.com/klimas7/exampleA.git>
* <https://github.com/klimas7/exampleB.git>

**Pipeline: Complex example**

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter branchFilter: 'origin.*/(.*)', defaultValue: 'master', name: 'BRANCH_A', type: 'PT_BRANCH', useRepository: '.*exampleA.git'
        gitParameter branchFilter: 'origin.*/(.*)', defaultValue: 'master', name: 'BRANCH_B', type: 'PT_BRANCH', useRepository: '.*exampleB.git'

    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                git branch: "${params.BRANCH_A}", url: 'https://github.com/klimas7/exampleA.git'
                git branch: "${params.BRANCH_B}", url: 'https://github.com/klimas7/exampleB.git'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

After initial run you get

[!['build with parameters' section](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin@master/docs/images/image2018-9-21_22-47-52.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/image2018-9-21_22-47-52.png)

Example when 'Use repository' is not set:

**Pipeline: Use repository is not set**

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        gitParameter branchFilter: 'origin.*/(.*)', defaultValue: 'master', name: 'BRANCH', type: 'PT_BRANCH'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/klimas7/exampleA.git'
                dir('dir-for-exampleB') {
                    git url: 'https://github.com/klimas7/exampleB.git'
		}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

After initial run you get

* Fix the pending issues from

  + Even though the GIT SCM module has the ability to provide "credentials" (SSH key) for the repository, the git-parameter plugin doesn't seem to use them. "Issue lukanus":[lukanus/git-parameter#14](https://github.com/lukanus/git-parameter/issues/14)
* Allow translations by converting all html stuff to jelly
* Add explanation when configuring the sort mode
* Allow regular expressions when sorting.
* Better testing. How to we test the configuration dialog? How do we test whether correct tags are listed when a user triggers a build?

## Development history

This plugin was offered to the community by lukanus (Łukasz Miłkowski [lukanus@uaznia.net](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-parameter-plugin/blob/master/mailto%3Alukanus%40uaznia.net)) end of 2011. He was active till February 2012.

In May 2014 ngiger (Niklaus Giger niklaus.giger) decided to maintain this plugin and bring in the various improvements made by others.

March 2016 klimas7 (Boguslaw Klimas) he began to the care and maintenance of the plugin.. We will see ... :)

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1884 / CVE-2020-2238
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.12 and earlier does not escape the repository
field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1625 / CVE-2020-2239
Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin 3.1.3 and earlier stores a secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This secret can be
viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1023 / CVE-2020-2240
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for the
database console, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL scripts.

SECURITY-1024 / CVE-2020-2241 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2242 (permission check)
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a
method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified username and
password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1936 / CVE-2020-2243
Cadence vManager Plugin 3.0.4 and earlier does not escape build
descriptions in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1770 / CVE-2020-2244
Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.27.0 and earlier does not escape matching
text in a form validation response.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to provide console output for builds used to test build log
indications.

SECURITY-1829 / CVE-2020-2245
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Valgrind plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1830 / CVE-2020-2246
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not escape content in Valgrind XML
reports.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control Valgrind XML report contents.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1831 / CVE-2020-2247
Klocwork Analysis Plugin 2020.2.1 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1905 / CVE-2020-2248
JSGames Plugin 0.2 and earlier evaluates part of a URL as code.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1506 / CVE-2020-2249
Team Foundation Server Plugin 5.157.1 and earlier stores a webhook secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`hudson.plugins.tfs.TeamPluginGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller
as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by attackers with
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1631 (1) / CVE-2020-2250
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.3 and earlier stores project
passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration. These project passwords can be viewed by attackers with
Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1631 (2) / CVE-2020-2251
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin stores project passwords in job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While these passwords are stored encrypted on disk since SoapUI Pro
Functional Testing Plugin 1.4, they are transmitted in plain text as part
of the global configuration form by SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin
1.5 and earlier. These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended
Read permission.

This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins
2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and
decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
