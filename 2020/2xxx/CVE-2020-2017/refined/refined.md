- **Root cause:** A DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS and Panorama management web interfaces.
- **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it to generate HTML, which allows execution of malicious JavaScript in the context of a user's browser.
- **Impact:** A remote attacker who can convince an authenticated administrator to click a specially crafted link can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser, enabling them to perform administrative actions.
- **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network by enticing an administrator to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by a legitimate, authenticated administrator, will execute malicious Javascript in the administrator's browser. The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the PAN-OS system itself.
