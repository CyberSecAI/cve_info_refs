  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-2105",
    "description": "Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not serve the `X-Frame-Options: deny` HTTP header on REST API responses to protect against clickjacking attacks. An attacker could exploit this by routing the victim through a specially crafted web page that embeds a REST API endpoint in an iframe and tricking the user into performing an action which would allow for the attacker to learn the content of that REST API endpoint.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Jenkins weekly up to and including 2.218",
      "Jenkins LTS up to and including 2.204.1"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Jenkins weekly version 2.219",
      "Jenkins LTS version 2.204.2"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The application does not set the `X-Frame-Options: deny` HTTP header in REST API responses.",
    "weakness": "Missing HTTP header to prevent clickjacking.",
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a user into performing actions by embedding a REST API endpoint in an iframe, potentially gaining access to information from the API.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious web page that embeds a Jenkins REST API endpoint in an iframe. The victim is tricked into interacting with the iframe, leading to the attack.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a web page and trick the victim into visiting it. No specific user credentials are required.",
