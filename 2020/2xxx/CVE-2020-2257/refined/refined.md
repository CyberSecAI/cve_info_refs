Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2257:

**CVE-2020-2257**

*   **Root Cause:** The Validating String Parameter Plugin does not properly escape user-provided input within tooltips and other plugin elements. Specifically, it fails to escape regular expressions used in tooltips, as well as parameter names and parameter descriptions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts into tooltips, parameter names, and descriptions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session when they view the compromised Jenkins page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code within the regular expressions used in tooltips, as well as parameter names and descriptions within the Validating String Parameter plugin's configuration.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have "Job/Configure" permission to modify job configurations and inject malicious script into the affected fields.
