Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Robot Framework Plugin, in versions 2.0.0 and earlier, does not properly configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of protection against XXE attacks. This means the plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to processing maliciously crafted XML files that can include external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who can control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step can exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   **Extraction of secrets** from the Jenkins controller, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**, allowing the attacker to make requests to internal or external resources through the Jenkins server.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attacks, by causing the server to overload through excessive or malicious parsing requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating the input files used by the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step. An attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted XML file which will be processed by the vulnerable parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have the ability to control the input files processed by the Robot Framework plugin during the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step. This generally implies having at least the permissions to configure and execute jobs that use the affected plugin.  The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with the ability to control the input files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Robot Framework Plugin version 2.0.1, which disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
