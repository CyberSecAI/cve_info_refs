Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2167:

**CVE-2020-2167**

*   **Root Cause:** The OpenShift Pipeline Plugin's YAML parser was not configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This is a type of insecure deserialization vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper restrictions on the types that the YAML parser can instantiate. This allows an attacker to supply malicious YAML that, when parsed, can cause the instantiation of arbitrary Java objects.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the Jenkins server. This gives an attacker complete control over the Jenkins instance.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the OpenShift Pipeline Plugin's build step, where the plugin parses a YAML file provided by a user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be a user who is able to provide YAML input files to the OpenShift Pipeline Plugin's build step. This typically requires having the ability to configure or trigger jobs.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-2167 is a critical vulnerability in the OpenShift Pipeline Plugin. It arises from insecure deserialization of YAML inputs, allowing an attacker with the ability to provide YAML files for processing to achieve remote code execution. The fix involves configuring the YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
