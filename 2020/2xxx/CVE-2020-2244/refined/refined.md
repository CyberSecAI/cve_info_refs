Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2244:

**CVE-2020-2244**

*   **Root Cause:** The Build Failure Analyzer Plugin does not properly escape matching text in a form validation response.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the form validation response, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various impacts, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the Jenkins interface.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to be able to provide console output for builds used to test build log indications. This console output is then processed by the Build Failure Analyzer plugin, and if not properly escaped, the malicious script will be executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to provide console output for builds and also have the permission to test build log indications. This likely means they need to have Job/Configure or similar permissions that allow them to influence the build process.

**Summary:**

The Build Failure Analyzer Plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it does not escape the matching text in the form validation response. An attacker with the ability to influence build console output can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to the compromise of the Jenkins instance or other sensitive information.
