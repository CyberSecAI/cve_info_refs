Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2106:

**CVE-2020-2106**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Code Coverage API Plugin does not properly escape the filename of the coverage report when displaying it in its view.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper escaping of the filename.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the coverage report filename, which will then be executed in the context of other users viewing the report. This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions within the user's session, like stealing cookies or other sensitive data, or performing actions on their behalf.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   An attacker must be able to change the job configuration, which allows them to set the malicious filename.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into viewing the page containing the crafted filename to trigger the XSS.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker requires the "Job/Configure" permission, which allows them to modify the job configuration and inject the malicious filename. They do not require any special privileges beyond having the ability to modify job configurations. The exploitation requires user interaction (viewing the crafted page) to trigger the XSS.
