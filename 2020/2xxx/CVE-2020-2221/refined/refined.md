Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Jenkins core not properly escaping the display name of an upstream job when it's shown as part of a build cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. The lack of proper output escaping allows malicious code embedded in a job's display name to be stored and then executed within the context of other users' browsers when they view the build cause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of users viewing the build cause. This could lead to:
    - Stealing of session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Potentially gaining further access to the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the display name of a Jenkins job that is set as an upstream build dependency.
- An attacker would need to create a job that has a malicious display name containing JavaScript.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a job with this malicious display name is an upstream cause of another build and is viewed in the build cause.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have Job/Configure permissions in order to configure the display name of a job.
- No other special attacker capabilities are required. The user simply needs to configure the display name for a job.

**Summary**

CVE-2020-2221 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Jenkins core that occurs due to the lack of proper output escaping of upstream job display names when they are displayed as part of a build cause. An attacker with Job/Configure permissions can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript code within a job's display name. This would lead to the code being stored in Jenkins and executed when another user views the build cause, potentially leading to a range of malicious impacts. The fix is implemented in Jenkins version 2.245 and LTS version 2.235.2 where the job display name is properly escaped.
