Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The AWS SAM Plugin, in versions 1.2.2 and earlier, does not properly configure its YAML parser. Specifically, it fails to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types when processing YAML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure YAML Parsing:** The core vulnerability lies in the plugin's use of a YAML parser that is not configured to restrict the types of objects it can create during parsing. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary classes in the YAML and force their instantiation during parsing

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious YAML file, an attacker can trigger the instantiation of arbitrary classes leading to remote code execution on the Jenkins controller (server). This allows them to potentially gain complete control of the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious YAML Template:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by controlling the contents of a YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or equivalent). This template is used by the "AWS SAM deploy application" build step.
*   **Configuration of a job:** An attacker can configure a job and modify the SAM template, or influence it via a SCM repository
*   **SCM Repository Compromise:** An attacker could also exploit this by manipulating a template in a repository used by the Jenkins job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to configure jobs:** An attacker needs the ability to configure Jenkins jobs or control an SCM repository used by such jobs. This is typically achieved via user accounts with appropriate permissions within the Jenkins instance.
*   **Control over YAML template:** The attacker needs to be able to control the contents of the YAML SAM template file that is processed by the plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the AWS SAM Plugin and versions 1.2.2 and earlier
*   The fix involves configuring the YAML parser to only instantiate safe types, preventing arbitrary class instantiation.
*   The updated version of the plugin is 1.2.3
