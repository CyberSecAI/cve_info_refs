Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin does not properly sanitize or escape tooltip content. Specifically, user-provided input for tooltips is rendered without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of output sanitization. Malicious JavaScript code embedded in tooltip content can be stored and executed within the context of the user's browser when the tooltip is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the tooltip content. When a user views a build using the visualizer, the malicious script executes in their browser, which could lead to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies and taking over the user's session.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information accessible through the Jenkins interface.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   **Unauthorized actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user within the Jenkins system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the tooltip content.
*   The injected script executes when a user with Run/Update permissions views the build using the visualizer.
*   The malicious code is stored on the server and executed each time a user views the tooltip.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Run/Update Permission:** The attacker needs to have permissions to update build information which allows them to modify the tooltip content with malicious code.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the tooltip content is not escaped properly.
*   **Ability to inject malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the tooltip content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.12 of the Yet Another Build Visualizer Plugin.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as high severity.
*   The CVSS score is 8.8 (High): AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
