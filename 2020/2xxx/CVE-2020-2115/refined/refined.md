Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NUnit Plugin, versions 0.25 and earlier, does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE vulnerability:** The plugin's XML parser is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to a lack of proper configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can:
- Extract secrets from the Jenkins master
- Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input files for the NUnit plugin's post-build step.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure the input files for the NUnit plugin's post-build step within Jenkins. This typically means having Job/Configure permissions for the affected jobs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability arises because the XML parser is not configured to disable the processing of external entities, allowing the attacker to include malicious code within the provided XML files.
- This allows an attacker to force Jenkins to fetch data from an external URL or to send back local resources from the Jenkins controller by defining external entities within the crafted XML file.
