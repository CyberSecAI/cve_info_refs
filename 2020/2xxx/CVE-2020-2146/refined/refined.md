Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2146:

**CVE-2020-2146**

*   **Root Cause:** The Mac Plugin did not validate SSH host keys when connecting to Mac Cloud hosts launched by the plugin.
*   **Weakness:** Missing SSH host key validation.
*   **Impact:**  A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker could intercept connections to build agents, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the build process or the Jenkins environment.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. An attacker would need to be positioned within the network path between the Jenkins server and the Mac agent to perform a MitM attack.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the Mac build agent. This could involve being on the same network, compromising a router or switch in the path, or other network-level attack vectors.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was present in Mac Plugin versions 1.1.0 and earlier.
* The fix was included in Mac Plugin version 1.2.0, which validates SSH host keys when connecting to agents.
