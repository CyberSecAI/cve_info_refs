- **Root cause of vulnerability:** OS Command Injection vulnerability in the PAN-OS management web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a high privileged attacker (administrator) to execute arbitrary OS commands on the system with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, targeting the PAN-OS management web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated administrator with network access to the management interface.
