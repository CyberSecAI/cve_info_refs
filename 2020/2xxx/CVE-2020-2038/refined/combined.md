Palo Alto Networks is aware of publicly available information that may help construct proof of concept exploits for these issues.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-78 OS Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 9.0.10, PAN-OS 9.1.4, PAN-OS 10.0.1, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Until PAN-OS software is upgraded to a fixed version, enabling signatures for Unique Threat ID 59954 on traffic destined for the GlobalProtect portal, gateway, or VPN will block attacks against CVE-2020-2038.
