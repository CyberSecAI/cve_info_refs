Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2008:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from both an OS command injection flaw and an external control of filename vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  Authenticated administrators can inject arbitrary OS commands, leading to code execution with root privileges.
*  **External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73):** Allows administrators to manipulate filenames and paths, resulting in arbitrary file deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete arbitrary system files.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** File deletion impacts the system's integrity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileges Required: HIGH:** Requires an authenticated administrator account.
*   **Attack Complexity: LOW**: The vulnerability is easily exploitable
*   **User Interaction: NONE**: No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability

**Affected Versions:**

*   PAN-OS 7.1 (all versions)
*   PAN-OS 8.0 (all versions)
*   PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.14

**Unaffected Versions:**
*   PAN-OS 9.1 (all versions)
*   PAN-OS 9.0 (all versions)
*   PAN-OS 8.1.14 and later versions

**Mitigations:**

*   Upgrade to PAN-OS 8.1.14 or a later version.
*   Secure the PAN-OS management interface by following best practices.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered internally by Jin Chen of Palo Alto Networks.
*   PAN-OS 8.0 is end-of-life and no longer supported.
*   PAN-OS 7.1 is on extended support and is only considered for critical security fixes.
