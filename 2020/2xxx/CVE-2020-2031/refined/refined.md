- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `dnsproxyd` component of the PAN-OS management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer underflow (CWE-191)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An authenticated administrator can issue a specific command via the command line interface that causes the `dnsproxyd` component to stop responding, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts can restart the device, putting it into maintenance mode, impacting all PAN-OS services.
- **Attack vectors**: Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated administrator with command-line interface access to the PAN-OS management interface.
