Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2232:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in its global configuration file. While the password is encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext transmission of sensitive data (SMTP password)
- Exposure of sensitive data in the configuration form

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exposure of the SMTP password, potentially allowing an attacker to gain access to the email server or use it for malicious activities (e.g., sending spam, phishing emails)

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with access to the Jenkins configuration form (likely requiring administrative or configuration permissions) can view the plain text SMTP password while configuring the Email Extension Plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Attacker needs to be able to access the Jenkins configuration page (likely requires admin or config permissions).

**Additional Details:**

The advisory mentions that the issue is present in Email Extension Plugin versions 2.72 and 2.73, and it is fixed in version 2.74 which transmits the password encrypted and masks it.
