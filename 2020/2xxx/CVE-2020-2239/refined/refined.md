Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin stores a secret in plain text within its global configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unencrypted storage of sensitive data (secret) in the `org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the unencrypted secret.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or systems protected by the exposed secret.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the file system of the Jenkins controller where the configuration file is stored.
- No specific Jenkins permissions are needed, as this is a file system access issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions are Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin 3.1.3 and earlier.
- Version 3.1.4 addresses the issue by encrypting the secret upon saving the configuration again.
