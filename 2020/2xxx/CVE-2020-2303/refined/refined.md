Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-2303:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Active Directory Plugin does not require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints, which implement connection and authentication tests. This lack of enforcement allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can perform connection tests by connecting to attacker-specified or previously configured Active Directory servers, using attacker-specified credentials. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access or control over resources on the Active Directory network, depending on what actions the connection test is configured to perform.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable HTTP endpoints through the user's browser. This is a CSRF attack and thus relies on a user being tricked into triggering it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any privileges on the Jenkins instance itself. However, the attacker needs to be able to trick a user logged into Jenkins into loading a malicious page or clicking a malicious link that triggers the exploit. This can typically be achieved through various techniques such as phishing.
