SECURITY-1374 / CVE-2020-2181
Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace
with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build
steps.

SECURITY-1835 / CVE-2020-2182
Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as
environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds. As
a side effect of the fix for SECURITY-698, `$` characters in secrets are
escaped to `$$`. This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is
passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form
of the secret (containing `$$`). This occurs for example in the "Execute
Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

SECURITY-988 / CVE-2020-2183
Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks
when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project
build. This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to
configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to
access.

SECURITY-1094 / CVE-2020-2184
CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP
endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an
attacker-specified URL.

SECURITY-381 / CVE-2020-2185
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation
when connecting to agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1408 / CVE-2020-2186
Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities. This allows an attacker to provision instances with an
attacker-specified template ID.

SECURITY-1528 / CVE-2020-2187
Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed
HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting
to Windows agents. This lack of validation could be abused using a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1844 / CVE-2020-2188
Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2
Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission
to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1826 / CVE-2020-2189
SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML
parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to
configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously
configured job's SCM repository.

## Descriptions

### Secrets are not masked by Credentials Binding Plugin in builds without build steps

**SECURITY-1374
/
CVE-2020-2181**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets when the build contains no build steps.
Â

### Improper masking of some secrets in Credentials Binding Plugin

**SECURITY-1835
/
CVE-2020-2182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials-binding`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding)**

**Description:**

Credentials Binding Plugin allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
As a side effect of the fix for [SECURITY-698](/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding), `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`.
This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`).
This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

Credentials Binding Plugin 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.

### Improper permission checks in Copy Artifact Plugin

**SECURITY-988
/
CVE-2020-2183**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copyartifact`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact)**

**Description:**

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build.
This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.

Copy Artifact Plugin 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts.
When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained ("Migration mode").
To enable the additional protections, switch to the new "Production mode".
Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts.
For more information see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).

### CSRF vulnerability in CVS Plugin

**SECURITY-1094
/
CVE-2020-2184**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cvs`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cvs)**

**Description:**

CVS Plugin 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

CVS Plugin 2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Missing SSH host key validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-381
/
CVE-2020-2185**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 provides strategies for performing host key validation for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
It includes assistance for administrators to migrate to a new, more secure strategy.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-unix-amis).

### CSRF vulnerability in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1408
/
CVE-2020-2186**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
This allows an attacker to provision instances with an attacker-specified template ID.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

### Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1528
/
CVE-2020-2187**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.
This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation.
A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior.
For more information see [the plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis).

### Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1844
/
CVE-2020-2188**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.50.2 now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### RCE vulnerability in SCM Filter Jervis Plugin

**SECURITY-1826
/
CVE-2020-2189**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`scm-filter-jervis`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scm-filter-jervis)**

**Description:**

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job’s SCM repository.

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
