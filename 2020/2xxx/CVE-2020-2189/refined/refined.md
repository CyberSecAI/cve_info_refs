Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SCM Filter Jervis Plugin's YAML parser was not configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This means that the parser could be manipulated to create objects of any class, including those that could lead to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is due to the insecure deserialization of YAML data, allowing an attacker to control the types of objects instantiated.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the insecure deserialization, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the Jenkins server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server, potentially gaining complete control of the system. This could lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and other severe security consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Job Configuration:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a Jenkins job with the SCM Filter Jervis Plugin, inserting malicious YAML code into the job's configuration.
*   **SCM Repository Control:** An attacker could also exploit this if they could control the contents of the SCM repository used by a previously configured job, and insert malicious YAML code in a place where the Jervis filter will parse it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Job Configuration Permission:** An attacker needs the ability to configure jobs that use the SCM Filter Jervis Plugin to directly insert the malicious YAML.
*   **SCM Repository Control (Indirectly):** An attacker could also exploit this if they can control the SCM repository used by a previously configured job.
