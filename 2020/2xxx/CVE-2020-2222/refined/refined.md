Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Jenkins core not properly escaping the job name within the tooltip of the "Keep this build forever" badge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript can be injected through the job name, and this script gets executed when a user hovers over the "Keep this build forever" badge.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The core issue is the failure to sanitize or encode the job name before it's included in the HTML tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify displayed information or perform actions within the Jenkins instance as the victim user.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Job Configuration:** An attacker needs the ability to configure job names to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User with Job/Configure Permissions:** An attacker needs to have the necessary permissions to modify the job name, which typically involves `Job/Configure` permissions. While the advisory mentions this is believed to be difficult to exploit due to character set limitations, the vulnerability exists.

**Affected Versions:**
- Jenkins 2.244 and earlier
- Jenkins LTS 2.235.1 and earlier

**Fixed Versions:**
- Jenkins 2.245
- Jenkins LTS 2.235.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the character set limitations for job names make this vulnerability difficult to exploit in common configurations. However, the vulnerability is still present.
- The fix involves properly escaping the job name in the tooltip, preventing the execution of injected scripts.
