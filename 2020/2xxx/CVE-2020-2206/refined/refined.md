Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2206:

**CVE Description:**

VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output. This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The VncRecorder plugin does not properly sanitize or escape a parameter value before including it in the output of the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is injected into the request and reflected back to the user in the response.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the output of the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint.
*   This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser when they access the crafted URL, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Malware injection
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session on the Jenkins server

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a malicious script as a parameter value for the `checkVncServ` endpoint.
*   The attacker tricks a user into clicking this malicious URL. This could be through social engineering, email, or embedding the URL on a website.
*   When the user visits the crafted URL, the unescaped malicious script is included in the response and executed by the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to construct a URL with malicious script as a parameter value.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the crafted malicious URL. This does not necessarily require any specific permissions on the Jenkins server.
*   No special access rights on the Jenkins server are needed to exploit this vulnerability, as it is a reflected XSS attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in VncRecorder Plugin versions 1.25 and earlier.
*   The issue is fixed in VncRecorder Plugin version 1.35, which properly escapes the parameter value in the output of the `checkVncServ` endpoint.
*   The `checkVncServ` endpoint is accessed via the job configuration forms.
