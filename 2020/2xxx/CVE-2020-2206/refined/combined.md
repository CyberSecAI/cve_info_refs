This plugin records screen of current build or other configured VNC
session as Shock Wave Flash (swf) file during a build and stores it as
an artifact. This plugin can be used in combination with
[VncViewer](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/VncViewer%2BPlugin) and
[Xvnc plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Xvnc%2BPlugin).

After the build, the video file gets also published as a HTTP link in
the "Console output" of the build. The generated HTML file embeds a
video and makes it possible to navigate within a recorded video directly
in browser.

# Requirements

* Linux on Jenkins master node
* [vnc2swf](http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?stat=3&limit=1&srodzaj=3&dl=80&search=pyvnc2swf) on
  Jenkins master node

SECURITY-1775 / CVE-2020-2201
Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file
path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1690 / CVE-2020-2202
Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to
allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on
Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read
permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as
part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1691 / CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)
Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured
Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1728 (1) / CVE-2020-2205
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration
forms.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

SECURITY-1728 (2) / CVE-2020-2206
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in
the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1776 / CVE-2020-2207
VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1627 / CVE-2020-2208
Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1686 / CVE-2020-2209
TestComplete support Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted
in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This password can
be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master
file system.

SECURITY-1656 / CVE-2020-2210
Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global
configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
0.3.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1738 / CVE-2020-2211
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not
configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

files) or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1811 / CVE-2020-2214
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins. This
allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to
control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1762 / CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)
Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

whitesource Plugin 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as part of its global configuration file `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by ZAP Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1811
/
CVE-2020-2214**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zap-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zap-pipeline)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) configured are largely unaffected.
A possible exception are file parameter downloads.
The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:

* Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.
* Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.
* Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, don’t have XSS protection for file parameter values, see [SECURITY-1793](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin

**SECURITY-1762
/
CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zephyr-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zephyr-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Reflected XSS in Compatibility Action Storage Plugin

**SECURITY-1771
/
CVE-2020-2217**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compatibility-action-storage`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compatibility-action-storage)**

**Description:**

Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation endpoint.
This allows attackers able to update the configured document in MongoDB to inject the payload.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Password stored in plain text by HP ALM Quality Center Plugin

**SECURITY-1576
/
CVE-2020-2218**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hp-quality-center`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hp-quality-center)**

**Description:**

HP ALM Quality Center Plugin 1.6 and earlier stores a password in plain text in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.qc.QualityCenterIntegrationRecorder.xml`.
This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Link Column Plugin

**SECURITY-1803
/
CVE-2020-2219**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`link-column`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/link-column)**

**Description:**

Link Column Plugin allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.

Link Column Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links, allowing the `javascript:` scheme.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list views.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
