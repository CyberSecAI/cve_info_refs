## Description

This plugin collects and publishes [Robot
Framework](http://robotframework.org/ "Robot Framework Home")
test results in Jenkins. The plugin **doesn't** run Robot Framework, it
only reports the results.

Preconditions: all "suggested plugins" are "installed" in Jenkins.

[Issue
Tracker](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+JENKINS+AND+component+%3D+robot-plugin)

## Current features

* Test suite and case details with trend graphs
* Environment variable expansion for build paths in configuration
* Wildcard support for output files for parsing and archiving of
  multiple Robot result files
* Collection and archiving of original Robot report HTML files
* Summary of Robot run on build page
* Summary of latest Robot run on project page
* Trend graph of passed tests over builds on project page
* Marking build failed/unstable/successful according to pass
  thresholds given by user
* Listview column to show overall passed/failed tests in project
  listing and duration trend
* Configurable archiving of arbitrary Robot related artifacts per
  build
* Token macros for usage with e.g. email-ext plugin
* Test visibility in radiator views

## Configuration

### Basic configuration of testing task

1. Configure your project
2. Select: Build -> Add build step -> execute shell/Execute Windows
   batch command
3. Add the command to run the tests. You might have direct robot/jybot
   command here like `robot --variable name:value --outputdir my_robot_results my_test_suite` or in case you need to do
   something more, you can call any script that you use for running the
   tests. Relevant part from Robot Jenkins Plugin point of view is that
   this script generates the Robot outputs.
4. Force your Robot script to return successfully from shell with `exit 0` to empower the plugin in deciding if the build is success/failure
   (by default Robot exits with error code when there's any failed
   tests). You can do this for example by adding `--nostatusrc` to your
   test run (see
   [Robot Framework user guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#return-codes)
   for details).
5. Select: Post-build Actions -> Publish Robot Framework test results
6. Set path where your results are located (in above example command
   `my_robot_results`)
7. If your output files are named differently than default (i.e.
   output.xml, report.html and log.html) specify the filenames by
   pressing the "Advanced..." button and writing the names in relevant
   fields. The fields support wildcards `*` and `?`.
8. If you have other artifacts such as screenshots that you want to
   persist for viewing later in the logs you must configure them under
   "Advanced... -> Other files to copy". The field accepts comma
   separated list of files and supports wildcards `*` and `?`.
9. Set thresholds and optionally disable thresholds for critical tests
   only to count every test in the pass percentage.

### Pipeline configuration

1. Run your tests in a similar way as you would normally by using the `sh` step.
2. Call the plugin with either the general `step` or directly by calling `robot` (only from
   version 2.0 onwards):

   ```
   robot(outputPath: ".",
       passThreshold: 90.0,
       unstableThreshold: 70.0,
       disableArchiveOutput: true,
       outputFileName: "output.xml",
       logFileName: 'log.html',
       reportFileName: 'report.html',
       countSkippedTests: true,    // Optional, defaults to false
       otherFiles: 'screenshot-*.png'
   )

   ```

**NOTE!** `onlyCritical` parameter has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has no effect on the results.

### Configuring direct links to log files

#### Version 1.3.0+

Links are automatically generated to whatever files are configured to
"Report html" and "Log html" in the plugin configuration. Links to log
and report HTMLs are now only in the summary sections in the middle of
the page and the sidebar link from previous versions have been removed.

*side panel link*

![summary link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/robot-plugin/master/doc/images/robot_summary_table.png)
*Summary link*

### Configuring Robot overall pass/fail to show in the project list

The list view column showing the overall pass/fail and duration trend should be visible
by default in the project list. If it's not visible, you can add it by following these steps:

1. Go to Jenkins front page
2. Select the + sign in the top tabs of the project listing to create a
   new view or go to
   [http://YOURJENKINSHOST/newView](http://yourjenkinshost/newView)
3. Name your view and proceed creating a list view
4. Choose project you want to include to the view. By default, the
   "Robot pass/fail" column will appear to the column listing.
5. Save view and select it from the top tabs in Jenkins project listing
6. (Optional) If you want to have the view on by default go to "Manage
   Jenkins"->"Configure System" (or
   [http://YOURJENKINSHOST/configure](http://yourjenkinshost/configure)
   )and select your newly created view to be the default one.

![List view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/robot-plugin/master/doc/images/robot_view_column.png)
*List view column in action*

### Using token macros in e-mail report

Prerequisites: token-macro plugin and email-ext plugin installed.

1. Go to project configuration
2. Enable "Editable Email Notification" in post-build actions
   ([configuration
   reference](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext%2Bplugin))
3. Now you can use the following Robot variables in your custom result
   email:

   * `${ROBOT_FAILEDCASES, addErrorMessages}` - Expands to list of failed Robot cases. Each
     case on its own line.
     `addErrorMessages` is an optional parameter that can be used to include error messages in the output. Default value is `false`.
   * `${ROBOT_FAILED}` - Expands to count of failed cases.
   * `${ROBOT_PASSPERCENTAGE, countSkippedTests}` - Expands to pass percentage
     of tests. (passed / total \* 100 %).
     `countSkippedTests` is an optional parameter that can be used to include skipped tests in the total count. Default value is `false`.
   * `${ROBOT_PASSRATIO}` - Expands to build result in 'passed
     / total' format. This total includes skipped test cases.
   * `${ROBOT_PASSED}` - Expands to count of passed cases.
   * `${ROBOT_REPORTLINK}` - If logfile link is configured in the Robot
     plugin this link will point to that file for the build. Else show
     link to Robot reports directory for the build.
   * `${ROBOT_TOTAL}` - Expands to total count of test cases. This total includes skipped test cases.

### Displaying test numbers in build radiator views etc.

> :warning: If the Robot plugin marks the build as failure the tests will not show
> up. This is because only unstable and successful builds are considered
> to have test results per Jenkins.
>
> This means that in order to see the test results in other views you must
> set your unstable threshold so that the build never goes to failure.

### Log File Not Showing Properly

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/robot-plugin/master/doc/images/log_fail_open.png)

If you see an error saying that `Opening Robot Framework log failed`, the most probable reason
is that your Content Security Policy is too strict. Similarly, if your log opens, but it doesn't
show embedded images or similar, the reason is most probably in CSP settings.

See [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/configuring-content-security-policy/)
and [here](https://content-security-policy.com/) how to change you CSP settings in your script console,
but be aware that **Changing CSP settings will potentially expose you Jenkins instance for
security vulnerabilities**.

## Robot Framework 4.x+ compatibility

:heavy\_exclamation\_mark: As we're preparing to drop support for RF 3.x, the `onlyCritical` flag has been deprecated and no
longer has any effect. It will be removed in the future, but for now it's available for the transition period.
A new flag `countSkippedTests` has been added to the pipeline step to allow users to choose whether to count skipped
tests in the pass percentage calculation.

The plugin still supports RF 3.x, but no longer takes criticality into account. If you want to use RF 3.x with criticality, please downgrade to the last major version (4.0.0)

# Sounds

How to install

* [Documentation](/sounds/)
* [Releases](/sounds/releases/)
* [Issues](/sounds/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/sounds/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/sounds/healthscore/)

## Overview

This plugin is able to play audio clips locally through sound hardware, remotely by piping them through an operating system command, or simultaneously through all browsers that are on a Jenkins page.

When outputting through local hardware, Sounds requires that the Jenkins' server machine has a working sound card and speaker that is not in a remote server room where there's no one around to hear it.

Jenkins can execute a command on a remote machine to play a sound sent through a pipe. This is normally an SSH command to a remote Linux based host that has a working sound card (e.g. '`ssh <host> play -`').

If you have HTML5 Audio capable browsers you can configure Sounds to play sounds through all the browsers that are on a Jenkins page.

## Compatibility

For all of the options there are varying degrees of support for the multitude of audio file formats. The most widely supported (but the most inefficient) is WAV.

## Triggering Sounds

### Configured build action

A job can be configured to play a sound as part of its action. You can have jobs dedicated to playing sounds on a schedule, or have the job play a sound as it does other actions.

### Configured post-build actions

The build configuration allows you to select a sound to be played for any build state transition. You can configure:

* for any possible build result
* a list of previous build results
* the sound to play

### External trigger

A sound can also be triggered by making an HTTP POST request and passing a URL to the sound to be played. This enables external tools to play sounds through Jenkins.

```
<Jenkins URL>/sounds/playSound?src=file:///home/jenkins/sounds/somesound.wav

```

### Customising the sound archive

#### Making a sound archive

The sound archive is a simple .zip or .jar file containing sound files.

Jenkins analyses each file to detect whether it is a valid sound file supported by JavaSound. JavaSound supports AIFF, AU and WAV, see [formats](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/formats-138492.html#Formats).

NOTE: The filename extension does not guarantee that the format is supported. If you have a file that doesn't play, try passing it though an conversion tool.

Jenkins ignores the archive folder structure (to simplify packaging) and uses the file name less extension as an ID, so keep the archive flat, or avoid having the same filename in multiple folders.

#### Publishing your sound archive

Jenkins Sounds can read an archive from the local filing system, or an HTTP URL.

* publish the archive on a local web server and use `http://`
* put the archive in Jenkins' local filing system and use `file://`

NOTE: Jenkins streams the audio from the archive for each event (to reduce memory requirements), so make sure it's not too far away.

#### Configure Jenkins to use your archive

Within the Configure System section of Jenkins Management locate the settings for Jenkins Sounds.

Enter the path to the archive.

* Absolute `http://` and `file://` URLs will be used unmodified.
* URIs without a protocol will be assumed to be filing system references and converted to `file://` URLs.

After changing the sound archive location URL you must save the form before being able to test the sounds.

The Test Sound advanced option shows a list of the sounds found in the archive and their supported format.

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Amazon EC2
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)
* gitlab-hook
  Plugin
* [Health Advisor by CloudBees
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)
* [Redgate SQL Change Automation

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Amazon EC2 Plugin

**SECURITY-1004
/
CVE-2020-2090 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2091 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.47 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

|  | This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible. |
| --- | --- |

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Amazon EC2 Plugin 1.48 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### XXE vulnerability in Robot Framework Plugin

**SECURITY-1698
/
CVE-2020-2092**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`robot`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/robot)**

**Description:**

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.0 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Robot Framework Plugin 2.0.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin

**SECURITY-1708
/
CVE-2020-2093 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2094 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cloudbees-jenkins-advisor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-jenkins-advisor)**

**Description:**

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1696
/
CVE-2020-2095**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`redgate-sql-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/redgate-sql-ci)**

**Description:**

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

This is due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-1598](/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598).

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in gitlab-hook Plugin

**SECURITY-1683
/
CVE-2020-2096**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-hook`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-hook)**

**Description:**

gitlab-hook Plugin 1.4.2 and earlier does not escape project names in the `build_now` endpoint.
This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Sounds Plugin allow OS command execution

**SECURITY-814
/
CVE-2020-2097 (permission check), CVE-2020-2098 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`sounds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sounds)**

**Description:**

Sounds Plugin 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs performing form validation.
This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Severity

* SECURITY-814:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
