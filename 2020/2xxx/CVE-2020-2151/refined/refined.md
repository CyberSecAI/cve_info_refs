Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2151:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-2151

**Description:**

The Quality Gates Plugin for Jenkins stores credentials in its global configuration file (`quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml`) on the Jenkins master. Although these credentials are encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Quality Gates Plugin version 2.5 and earlier. This can lead to exposure of the credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The plugin transmits credentials in plain text during configuration form submission despite being stored encrypted on disk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure storage of credentials in memory during form transmission.
- Credentials transmitted over HTTP, which can be intercepted.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords).
- Unauthorized access to connected systems (in this case, SonarQube) if the credentials are used to access such systems
- Potential for further attacks if these leaked credentials are re-used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Interception of network traffic during configuration form submission using network sniffing.
- Use of malicious browser extensions designed to steal credentials from forms.
- Exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities to extract credential data if the configuration form is rendered within the context of an XSS vulnerability.
- Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system is not required but if obtained, can be used to read the `quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic of the Jenkins instance during configuration form submission.
- Ability to install and execute malicious browser extensions.
-  Ability to exploit existing XSS vulnerabilities on the Jenkins instance

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Quality Gates Plugin version 2.5 and earlier.
- There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication date of the advisory.
- The advisory states "Credentials transmitted in plain text by Quality Gates Plugin"
