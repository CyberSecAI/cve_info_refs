Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2188:

**CVE Description:**

The Amazon EC2 Plugin for Jenkins prior to version 1.50.2, allows users with Overall/Read permissions to enumerate valid credential IDs, which could be leveraged in a subsequent attack to obtain those credentials.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks in the Amazon EC2 Plugin when listing applicable credentials IDs. This allows users with `Overall/Read` permissions to view these IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The plugin fails to enforce sufficient access control before displaying a list of credentials IDs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing credential IDs to unauthorized users can provide valuable information to attackers, which can be used in further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:**  While this vulnerability itself doesn't directly expose the credentials (access key, secret key), it provides the attacker with the IDs of configured credentials. An attacker could use this information, combined with other vulnerabilities or exploits, to attempt to capture those credentials.
*  **Lateral Movement/Privilege Escalation:** An attacker, who initially had read-only access, might use the leaked credentials to escalate privileges within the AWS environment by deploying agents with the discovered credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the Jenkins instance is required.
*   **Jenkins UI:** Attackers would need access to the Jenkins UI and possess at least `Overall/Read` permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins User:** The attacker must be a valid Jenkins user with `Overall/Read` permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the Jenkins server.
*   **Knowledge of other vulnerabilities:** The attacker may require knowledge of other vulnerabilities to fully exploit the information disclosed by this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the vulnerability can be used as part of a larger attack chain. This means that an attacker might use this vulnerability to identify potentially exploitable credentials, and then leverage another flaw to actually retrieve those credentials.
*   The fix for this vulnerability in version 1.50.2 now requires `Overall/Administer` permissions to enumerate the credential IDs.
