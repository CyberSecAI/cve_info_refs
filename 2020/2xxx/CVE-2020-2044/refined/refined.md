Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-2044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software handles operational command history logging. The `opcmdhistory.log` file, intended to track command usage, inadvertently logs sensitive information, such as passwords, in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:**  The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive information through log files (CWE-532). Passwords and other confidential data are logged in plaintext within the `opcmdhistory.log` file.
*   **Inadequate Data Masking:** The logging mechanism does not properly mask or sanitize sensitive data before writing it to the log file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the `opcmdhistory.log` file can obtain sensitive information, such as administrator passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Limited Impact:** The impact is limited to information exposure, there is no mention of integrity or availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is classified as "LOCAL," meaning an attacker needs local access to the PAN-OS system's log files to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Privileges:** The attacker must have some level of local access to the system to read log files.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker can have low privileges to be able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PAN-OS versions prior to 8.1.16, 9.0.10, and 9.1.3.
*   PAN-OS 9.1 and later versions remove the `opcmdhistory.log` file and record command usage in the `req_stats.log` file, which addresses this issue.
*   The provided CVSS v3.1 base score is 3.3 (LOW), reflecting the limited scope of the vulnerability and the requirement for local access.

**Mitigation:**

* Upgrade to PAN-OS versions 8.1.16, 9.0.10, 9.1.3, or later.
* Follow best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface as detailed in the official documentation.
