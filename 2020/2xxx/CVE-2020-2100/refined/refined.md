    "relates_to_cve": true,
    "summary": "The Jenkins service is vulnerable to a UDP amplification reflection attack due to the network discovery service (UDP multicast/broadcast). A small request can trigger a large response, which could be used for DDoS attacks or cause denial of service within the same network.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The UDP multicast/broadcast network discovery service in Jenkins can be used in an amplification reflection attack because a small request to the service results in a much larger response.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "UDP multicast/broadcast service that is enabled by default",
        "Amplification vulnerability: small request, large response"
       ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows for a potential DDoS attack on a Jenkins master or a denial of service caused by two Jenkins masters going into an infinite loop of replies to one another.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote unauthenticated attacker sending requests to the UDP multicast/broadcast endpoint"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a small UDP request to trigger a large response. For the denial-of-service attack within the same network, the attacker would need to be within the same network as the Jenkins masters in order to send spoofed UDP packets."
