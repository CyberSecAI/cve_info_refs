# Database

How to install

* [Documentation](/database/)
* [Releases](/database/releases/)
* [Issues](/database/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/database/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/database/healthscore/)

This library plugin defines a common abstraction to connect to relational database. By doing so, it serves three purposes:

* It allows database driver plugins (such as [H2 Database Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/database-h2/)) to be developed, improving the user experience for administrators.
* It simplifies other plugins that use RDBMS by eliminating the need to code up a configuration UI to let administrators select database.

**This plugin is not meant to be used by end users by itself.** It's supposed to be included through the dependencies of other plugins. If you are wondering how to store your job configuration etc. in a database, the answer is that you cannot.

## Usage

### Abstraction

The key class in this plugin is the [Database](https://github.com/jenkinsci/database-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/database/Database.java) class, which acts as a holder for JDBC `DataSource` instance. The `Database` class is an extension point to be implemented by database driver plugins.

The calling code can use this `DataSource` instance to obtain a connection to the database.

### Use the Jenkins global database

This plugin adds a system configuration entry to let the administrator configure the database used by Jenkins to store miscellaneous stuff. So the easiest way for plugins to start storing data to the database is to use this `Database` instance. This global database instance is kept in the `GlobalDatabaseConfiguration` class. You can inject this via `@Inject`, or you can call `GlobalDatabaseConfiguration.get()` to retrieve it, and then use the `getDatabase()` method to obtain the `Database` instance.

Because the database is shared by all the plugins, please use table names that include your plugin name as a prefix to avoid collisions.

### Use the per-job database

In addition to the global database, this plugin also creates a database local to [TopLevelItem](https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/TopLevelItem). These databases are normally backed by embedded database that stores data under `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/NAME`, and this simplifies the backup, copying, deletion of the data that's local to jobs (such as test reports, coverage data, and so on.)

This information is kept in the `PerItemDatabase` class, which you can obtain by `PerItemDatabaseConfiguration.findOrNull()`.

### Your own database

Sometimes it makes sense to store data to an entirely different database. Users may already have a database with data in it, in which case he'd want to just connect to that.

A plugin that wants to do this should define a field whose type is `Database` (see [example](https://github.com/jenkinsci/database-plugin/blob/master/src/test/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/database/Sample.java)). In the config.{groovy,jelly}, use the `f:dropdownDescriptorSelector` tag to allow the user to select a database (see [example](https://github.com/jenkinsci/database-plugin/blob/master/src/test/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/database/Sample/config.groovy)).

### JPA support

This plugin exposes it through [JPA 2.0 API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) (internally, it uses Hibernate but please do not rely on this fact if you can as it may change.) The entry point to the JPA support is the `PersistenceService` class, and this exposes methods for obtaining `EntityManagerFactory` for both the global database as well as arbitrary per-item database of your choice.

Because there are several different databases, involved, `@Entity` annotation alone is not sufficient. For persisted classes meant for the global database, please put `@GlobalTable` in addition to `@Entity`.

The following code shows how to use this to persiste a new row:

```
public class Push {
    @Inject
    PersistenceService ps;

    public void go(int n) throws IOException, SQLException {
        Jenkins.getInstance().getInjector().injectMembers(this);
        EntityManager em = ps.getGlobalEntityManagerFactory().createEntityManager();
        em.getTransaction().begin();
        TestRow row = new TestRow();
        row.buildNumber = n;
        row.x = "foo";
        em.persist(row);
        em.getTransaction().commit();
        em.close();
    }
}

@GlobalTable
@Entity
public class TestRow {
    @Id
    @Column
    public int buildNumber;

    @Column
    public String x;
}
```

## Troubleshooting performance problems with OpenTelemetry and tracing

The Jenkins Database plugin supports OpenTelemetry and tracing to help troubleshoot performance issues.

To enable tracing, you need to:

* Install the [OpenTelemetry plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/) and configure it
* Navigate to the "advanced" section of the Jenkins OpenTelemetry Plugin and set in the "Configuration properties" :
  + `otel.instrumentation.jdbc.enabled=true` to enable tracing in the Datasource provided by the Jenkins Database Plugin
  + `otel.instrumentation.jenkins.agent.enabled=true` to activate tracing in the Jenkins build agents if database calls are executed from the build agents

Note that changes to the `otel.instrumentation.jdbc.enabled` require to restart the Jenkins Controller and build agents.

Example database call span produced by the Jenkins JUnit SQL Storage plugin:

[![Jenkins pipeline trace with a JDBC span in Grafana](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/database-plugin@master/resources/images/screenshot-jenkins-pipeline-trace-with-jdbc-span.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/database-plugin/blob/master/resources/images/screenshot-jenkins-pipeline-trace-with-jdbc-span.png)

## Developing driver plugin

[MySQL Database plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/database-mysql/) and [PostgreSQL Database plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/database-postgresql/) are good examples of typical database driver plugins. For other "unusual" drivers that doesn't use the canonical host+database+username+password+properties combo, see [H2 Database plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/database-h2/) source code as an example.

SECURITY-1884 / CVE-2020-2238
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.12 and earlier does not escape the repository
field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1625 / CVE-2020-2239
Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin 3.1.3 and earlier stores a secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This secret can be
viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1023 / CVE-2020-2240
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for the
database console, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL scripts.

SECURITY-1024 / CVE-2020-2241 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2242 (permission check)
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a
method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified username and
password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1936 / CVE-2020-2243
Cadence vManager Plugin 3.0.4 and earlier does not escape build
descriptions in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1770 / CVE-2020-2244
Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.27.0 and earlier does not escape matching
text in a form validation response.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to provide console output for builds used to test build log
indications.

SECURITY-1829 / CVE-2020-2245
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Valgrind plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1830 / CVE-2020-2246
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not escape content in Valgrind XML
reports.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control Valgrind XML report contents.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1831 / CVE-2020-2247
Klocwork Analysis Plugin 2020.2.1 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1905 / CVE-2020-2248
JSGames Plugin 0.2 and earlier evaluates part of a URL as code.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1506 / CVE-2020-2249
Team Foundation Server Plugin 5.157.1 and earlier stores a webhook secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`hudson.plugins.tfs.TeamPluginGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller
as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by attackers with
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1631 (1) / CVE-2020-2250
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.3 and earlier stores project
passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration. These project passwords can be viewed by attackers with
Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1631 (2) / CVE-2020-2251
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin stores project passwords in job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While these passwords are stored encrypted on disk since SoapUI Pro
Functional Testing Plugin 1.4, they are transmitted in plain text as part
of the global configuration form by SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin
1.5 and earlier. These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended
Read permission.

This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins
2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and
decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
