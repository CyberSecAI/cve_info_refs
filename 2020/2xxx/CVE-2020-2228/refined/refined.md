Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GitLab Authentication Plugin prior to version 1.6 does not differentiate between user names and hierarchical group names when performing authorization. It treats them as interchangeable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authorization logic: The plugin fails to correctly distinguish between user names and group names in GitLab during authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker with the ability to create groups in GitLab can gain the privileges assigned to another user or group with the same base name by creating a group with the same name. For example, if a user named 'testuser' has certain permissions in Jenkins, an attacker could create a group named 'testuser' in GitLab and obtain the same permissions. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources, data, and administrative functions in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
- GitLab group creation: An attacker needs permissions to create groups within the GitLab instance integrated with the Jenkins server.
- Name collision: The attacker creates a GitLab group with the same name as an existing Jenkins user or group.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have an account with the ability to create groups in the linked GitLab instance.
- The attacker does not need any specific permissions within Jenkins itself, as they are exploiting a flaw in how permissions are mapped from GitLab.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the GitLab Authentication Plugin for Jenkins.
- The fix involves the plugin correctly using the appropriate GitLab APIs to perform authorization checks.
