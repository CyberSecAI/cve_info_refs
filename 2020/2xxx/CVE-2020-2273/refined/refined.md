Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2273:

**CVE-2020-2273**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The ElasTest Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation, and this validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Missing permission check:  A method that should require specific permissions does not, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Form validation methods can be triggered using GET requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to external resources and potential data leaks if the attacker gains access to a service with a vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attack.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user with Overall/Read permission to access a malicious link or webpage, triggering the request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker must have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The user needs to visit or load the attacker's malicious content to trigger the form validation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that there is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of its publication.
*   The ElasTest plugin is marked as deprecated due to the vulnerabilities and may no longer be supported.
*   This vulnerability is related to SECURITY-1903, which deals with the missing permission check issue. CVE-2020-2273 is specific to the CSRF aspect of that vulnerability in the ElasTest Plugin.
