Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2169:

**CVE-2020-2169**

*   **Root Cause:** The Queue cleanup Plugin's form validation endpoint fails to properly escape a query parameter before displaying it in an error message.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the error message. When a user views the crafted error message, the script would execute in their browser in the context of the Jenkins application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious actions.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to click on the crafted URL. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Queue cleanup Plugin versions 1.3 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in Queue cleanup Plugin version 1.4, which correctly escapes the query parameter.
* The provided content confirms that the vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the malicious script is part of the URL.
