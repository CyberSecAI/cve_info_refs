**CVE-2020-2110**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Script Security Plugin's sandbox protection could be bypassed during the script compilation phase by using AST transforming annotations, such as `@Grab`, on imports or inside other annotations. This was due to an incomplete fix of a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-1266).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input sanitization, Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability, Sandbox bypass
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master JVM, bypassing sandbox restrictions.
*   **Attack vectors**: By injecting specially crafted scripts with malicious AST annotations via plugins or HTTP endpoints that use sandboxed script validation.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Users with Overall/Read permissions can exploit the vulnerability.
