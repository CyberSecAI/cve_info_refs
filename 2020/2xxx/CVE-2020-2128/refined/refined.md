Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2128:

**CVE-2020-2128**

*   **Root Cause:** The ECX Copy Data Management Plugin stores the service password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Credentials Storage: The plugin stores a service password in plain text within the job's `config.xml` file. This is a major security flaw as sensitive credentials should always be encrypted.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: Attackers with "Extended Read" permissions or access to the Jenkins master file system can view the unencrypted password.
    *   Compromised Credentials: Exposure of the password allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access to the ECX service, leading to further malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Access to Job Configuration Files:  Attackers can exploit this by gaining unauthorized access to the `config.xml` files of Jenkins jobs configured with the vulnerable plugin. This can be achieved via direct filesystem access or through Jenkins UI if they have the necessary permissions.
    *   Permissions: Users with "Extended Read" permission on Jenkins or those with access to the Jenkins master file system can view the exposed password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Users with "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins.
    *   Users who have access to the Jenkins controller file system

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in ECX Copy Data Management Plugin version 1.9 and earlier.
*   There is no fix available as of the publication of the advisory.
*   The severity is rated as medium.
*   The advisory mentions that the credential can be viewed by users with "Extended Read permission or access to the master file system".
