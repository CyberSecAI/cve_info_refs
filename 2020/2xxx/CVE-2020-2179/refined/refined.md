Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Yaml Axis Plugin, in versions 0.2.0 and earlier, uses a YAML parser that is not configured to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe YAML parsing: The plugin's YAML parser allows the instantiation of arbitrary types, leading to a deserialization vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server. This could lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Multi-configuration (Matrix) job configuration: An attacker with the ability to configure a multi-configuration (Matrix) job can inject malicious YAML that exploits the unsafe parsing behavior
- SCM Repository Control: An attacker who can control the contents of a previously configured job's SCM repository can also introduce a malicious YAML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user authorized to configure multi-configuration (Matrix) jobs within Jenkins.
- Alternatively, the attacker needs to control the contents of a repository used by a previously configured job.
- The attacker does not need to interact with the user, it is sufficient for the vulnerable code to be executed on the server by Jenkins.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Yaml Axis Plugin version 0.2.1, which configures the YAML parser to only instantiate safe types, resolving the arbitrary type instantiation vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-1825 in the Jenkins Security Advisory.
