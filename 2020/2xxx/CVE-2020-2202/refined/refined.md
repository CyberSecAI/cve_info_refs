Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2202:

**CVE-2020-2202**

*   **Root Cause:** The Fortify on Demand Plugin does not properly check permissions when providing a list of applicable credential IDs.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Permission Check:** The plugin allows any user with Overall/Read permission to retrieve a list of valid credential IDs, which should be restricted to users with specific permissions.
    *   **Credential ID Enumeration:** The vulnerability allows enumeration of credential IDs, which could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to capture the credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can obtain a list of valid credential IDs. These IDs could then be used in subsequent attacks, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities, to gain access to the actual credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attack.
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
