## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Sonargraph Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1775
/
CVE-2020-2201**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sonargraph-integration`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonargraph-integration)**

**Description:**

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin

**SECURITY-1690
/
CVE-2020-2202**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Fortify on Demand Plugin

**SECURITY-1691
/
CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This form validation method requires appropriate permission in Fortify on Demand Plugin 6.0.0.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in VncRecorder Plugin

**SECURITY-1728 (1)
/
CVE-2020-2205**

**Severity (CVSS):**

**Affected plugin:
[`vncrecorder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vncrecorder)**

**Description:**

VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration forms.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

VncRecorder Plugin 1.35 escapes the tool path.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in VncRecorder Plugin

**SECURITY-1728 (2)
/
CVE-2020-2206**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vncrecorder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vncrecorder)**

**Description:**

VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

VncRecorder Plugin 1.35 escapes the parameter value in the output.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in VncViewer Plugin

**SECURITY-1776
/
CVE-2020-2207**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vncviewer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vncviewer)**

**Description:**

VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

VncViewer Plugin 1.8 escapes the parameter value in the output.

### Secret stored in plain text by Slack Upload Plugin

**SECURITY-1627

[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`slack-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack-uploader)**

**Description:**

Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This secret can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Password stored in plain text by TestComplete support Plugin

**SECURITY-1686
/
CVE-2020-2209**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`TestComplete`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/TestComplete)**

**Description:**

TestComplete support Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This password can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Passwords transmitted in plain text by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin

**SECURITY-1656
/
CVE-2020-2210**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`StashBranchParameter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/StashBranchParameter)**

**Description:**

Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin 0.3.0 and earlier.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### RCE vulnerability in ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin

**SECURITY-1738
/
CVE-2020-2211**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`kubernetes-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kubernetes-ci)**

**Description:**

ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin’s build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Secret stored in plain text by GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin

**SECURITY-1632
/
CVE-2020-2212**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-coverage-reporter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-coverage-reporter)**

**Description:**

GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin 1.8 and earlier stores a GitHub access token in plain text in its global configuration file `io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`.
This token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Credentials stored in plain text by whitesource Plugin

**SECURITY-1630
/
CVE-2020-2213**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`whitesource`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/whitesource)**

**Description:**

whitesource Plugin 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as part of its global configuration file `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by ZAP Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-1811
/
CVE-2020-2214**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zap-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zap-pipeline)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) configured are largely unaffected.
A possible exception are file parameter downloads.
The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:

* Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.
* Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.
* Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, don’t have XSS protection for file parameter values, see [SECURITY-1793](/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin

**SECURITY-1762
/
CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`zephyr-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/zephyr-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Reflected XSS in Compatibility Action Storage Plugin

**SECURITY-1771
/
CVE-2020-2217**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compatibility-action-storage`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compatibility-action-storage)**

**Description:**

Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation endpoint.
This allows attackers able to update the configured document in MongoDB to inject the payload.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Password stored in plain text by HP ALM Quality Center Plugin

**SECURITY-1576
/
CVE-2020-2218**

[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`hp-quality-center`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/hp-quality-center)**

**Description:**

HP ALM Quality Center Plugin 1.6 and earlier stores a password in plain text in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.qc.QualityCenterIntegrationRecorder.xml`.
This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Link Column Plugin

**SECURITY-1803
/
CVE-2020-2219**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`link-column`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/link-column)**

**Description:**

Link Column Plugin allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.

Link Column Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links, allowing the `javascript:` scheme.
This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list views.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1775 / CVE-2020-2201
Sonargraph Integration Plugin 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file
path for the Log file field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can
be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1690 / CVE-2020-2202
Fortify on Demand Plugin provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to
allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions in Fortify on
Demand Plugin 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read
permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those can be used as
part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-1691 / CVE-2020-2203 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2204 (missing permission check)
Fortify on Demand Plugin 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured
Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1728 (1) / CVE-2020-2205
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration
forms.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

SECURITY-1728 (2) / CVE-2020-2206
VncRecorder Plugin 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in
the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1776 / CVE-2020-2207
VncViewer Plugin 1.7 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the
`checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1627 / CVE-2020-2208
Slack Upload Plugin 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1686 / CVE-2020-2209
TestComplete support Plugin 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted
in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration. This password can
be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master
file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1656 / CVE-2020-2210
Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global
configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin
0.3.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1738 / CVE-2020-2211
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin 1.3 and earlier does not
configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by
users able to provide YAML input files to ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes
CI/CD Plugin's build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1632 / CVE-2020-2212
GitHub Coverage Reporter Plugin 1.8 and earlier stores a GitHub access
token in plain text in its global configuration file
`io.jenkins.plugins.gcr.PluginConfiguration.xml`. This can be viewed by
users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1630 / CVE-2020-2213
White Source Plugin 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as
part of its global configuration file
`org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml`
files) or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1811 / CVE-2020-2214
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

ZAP Pipeline Plugin 1.9 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins. This
allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to
control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1762 / CVE-2020-2215 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2216 (missing permission check)
Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows
users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1771 / CVE-2020-2217
Compatibility Action Storage Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not escape the
content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation
endpoint. This allows attackers able to update the configured document in
MongoDB to inject the payload.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1576 / CVE-2020-2218
HP ALM Quality Center Plugin 1.6 and earlier stores a password in plain
text in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.qc.QualityCenterIntegrationRecorder.xml`. This
password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file
system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1803 / CVE-2020-2219
Link Column Plugin allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new
column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.

Link Column Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links,
allowing the `javascript:` scheme. This results in a stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list
views.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
