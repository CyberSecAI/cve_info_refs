Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-2247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Klocwork Analysis Plugin's XML parser was not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: The plugin's XML parser does not disable external entity processing, allowing for XXE injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information/secrets from the Jenkins controller.
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Attackers could potentially use the Jenkins server to make requests to internal or external systems, leading to SSRF attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted XML Input: An attacker can craft a malicious XML file containing external entity definitions and provide it as an input to the Klocwork plugin parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Control over input files: The attacker needs to be able to control or modify the XML files that are parsed by the Klocwork plugin. This is described as "a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin parser".
- Likely requires some level of access to the Jenkins instance (e.g., ability to configure jobs that use the plugin or upload a malicious file through some other means).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability existed in Klocwork Analysis Plugin versions 2020.2.1 and earlier.
- At the time of the security advisory, no fix was available. However, the changelog shows that it was fixed in version 2020.3.1.
- The security advisory mentions that a user with the ability to control input files is able to perform the attack.

This information is consistent with the provided CVE description placeholder: "This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.".
