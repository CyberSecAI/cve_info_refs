Also skipped the check internally between the diff file and the build specification as kwciagent does this itself and also provides output to skipped files. This change does not impact existing configuration or behaviour.

#### Version 2.5.0

* Feature: Added option to the advanced section of the integration analysis step, that if the specified project does not exist it will be created or duplicated from another. This change does not impact existing configuration or behaviour (off by default), however to make use of the new feature extra pipeline configuration or GUI configuration is needed.

#### Version 2.4.9

* Bug Fix: Update to resolve issue with the Klocwork server url links. Projects with special characters such as spaces or projects that had been renamed would generate invalid url links. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.8

#### Version 2.4.7

* Bug Fix: Resolved issue introduced in 2.4.6 where global server/install settings were not being saved. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue where the trend graph and Klocwork link introduced in 2.4.3 were not showing in pipeline jobs. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.
* Bug Fix: Resolved issue when generating a pipeline snippet on step 'klocworkIntegrationStep2'. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.6

* Feature: Added the ability to use with jcasc plugin. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.5

* Bug Fix: Resolved issue in which when reading the ltoken file the resource was not closed. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.4

* Bug Fix: Post-build step "Klocwork Gateway". The query string sent to the server was being incorrectly formatted due to errors in the code. No impact or change to configuration should be needed.

#### Version 2.4.3

* New feature: Added trend graph and link to Klocwork review to the main product page. Configuration can be found in the integration step for loading. This does impact pipeline configuration
* Important note: This version requires an update to the pipeline scripts running integration builds to continue to run. Please find examples below:

Pipeline before 2.4.3:

```
klocworkIntegrationStep2 ( [ tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}", buildName: "", additionalOpts: "" ])

```

Pipeline 2.4.3 without trend chart:

```
klocworkIntegrationStep2 (
            serverConfig:[
                tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}",
                buildName: "",
                additionalOpts: ""
            ]
)

```

Pipeline 2.4.3 with trend chart:

```
klocworkIntegrationStep2 (
            serverConfig:[
                tablesDir: "${KLOCWORK_TABLES}",
                buildName: "",
                additionalOpts: ""
            ],
            reportConfig:[
               displayChart: true,
               chartHeight: "",
               chartWidth: "",
               query: "status:Analyze"
           ]
 )

SECURITY-1884 / CVE-2020-2238
Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.12 and earlier does not escape the repository
field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1625 / CVE-2020-2239
Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin 3.1.3 and earlier stores a secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This secret can be
viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1023 / CVE-2020-2240
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for the
database console, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL scripts.

SECURITY-1024 / CVE-2020-2241 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2242 (permission check)
database Plugin 1.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a
method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an
attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified username and
password.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1936 / CVE-2020-2243
Cadence vManager Plugin 3.0.4 and earlier does not escape build
descriptions in tooltips.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

SECURITY-1770 / CVE-2020-2244
Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.27.0 and earlier does not escape matching
text in a form validation response.

This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to provide console output for builds used to test build log
indications.

SECURITY-1829 / CVE-2020-2245
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Valgrind plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1830 / CVE-2020-2246
Valgrind Plugin 0.28 and earlier does not escape content in Valgrind XML
reports.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control Valgrind XML report contents.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1831 / CVE-2020-2247
Klocwork Analysis Plugin 2020.2.1 and earlier does not configure its XML
parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin
parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for
extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request
forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1905 / CVE-2020-2248
JSGames Plugin 0.2 and earlier evaluates part of a URL as code.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1506 / CVE-2020-2249
Team Foundation Server Plugin 5.157.1 and earlier stores a webhook secret
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`hudson.plugins.tfs.TeamPluginGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller
as part of its configuration. This secret can be viewed by attackers with
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1631 (1) / CVE-2020-2250
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin 1.3 and earlier stores project
passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration. These project passwords can be viewed by attackers with
Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-1631 (2) / CVE-2020-2251
SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin stores project passwords in job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While these passwords are stored encrypted on disk since SoapUI Pro
Functional Testing Plugin 1.4, they are transmitted in plain text as part
of the global configuration form by SoapUI Pro Functional Testing Plugin
1.5 and earlier. These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended
Read permission.

This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins
2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and
decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
