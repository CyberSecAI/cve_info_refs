Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2258:

**CVE-2020-2258**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin lacks proper permission checks in an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Incorrect permission check.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission can access an administrative configuration page that should only be accessible to users with `Overall/Administer` permission. This may expose sensitive administrative settings and internal configurations.
*   **Attack vectors:** By sending an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permission to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**
The Health Advisor by CloudBees Plugin versions 3.2.0 and earlier improperly validate user permissions when accessing an administrative configuration page via an HTTP endpoint. This allows users with read access to view configurations normally limited to administrators, creating an information disclosure risk.
