## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1754
/
CVE-2020-2134 (constructors), CVE-2020-2135 (GroovyInterceptable)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be circumvented through:

* Crafted constructor calls and bodies (due to an incomplete fix of [SECURITY-582](/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#super-constructor-calls))
* Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Script Security Plugin 1.71 has additional restrictions and sanity checks to ensure that super constructors cannot be constructed without being intercepted by the sandbox.
In addition, it also intercepts method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable` as calls to `GroovyObject#invokeMethod(String, Object)`, which is on the list of dangerous signatures and should not be approved for use in the sandbox.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-1723
/
CVE-2020-2136**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

This plugin adds support for sending a job's console log to Logstash indexers such as [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/de/products/logstash), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com), [Redis](https://redis.io/) or to Syslog.

* use [Jira](https://issues.jenkins.io) to report issues / feature requests

# Install

* Search for 'Logstash' in your Jenkins plugin manager

# Configure

Supported methods of input/output:

* ElasticSearch (REST API)
* Logstash TCP input
* Redis (format => 'json\_event')
* RabbitMQ (mechanism => PLAIN)
* Syslog (format => cee/json ([RFC-5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424),[RFC-3164](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164)), protocol => UDP)

# Pipeline

## Publisher

Logstash plugin can be used as a publisher in pipeline jobs to send the tail of the log as a single document.

**Example for publisher in pipeline**

```
node('master') {
    sh'''
        echo 'Hello, world!'
    '''
    logstashSend failBuild: true, maxLines: 1000
}
```

Note: Due to the way logging works in pipeline currently, the logstashSend step might not transfer the lines logged directly before the step is called. Adding a sleep of 1 second might help here.

Note: In order to get the the result set in pipeline it must be [set before the logstashSend step](https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/218554077-How-to-set-current-build-result-in-Pipeline-).

Note: the `logstashSend` step requires a node to run.

## Step with Block

It can be used as a wrapper step to send each log line separately.

Once the result is set, it will appear in the data sent to the indexer.

Note: when you combine with timestamps step, you should make the timestamps the outermost block. Otherwise you get the timestamps as part of the log lines, basically duplicating the timestamp information.

**Example for pipeline step**

```
timestamps {
  logstash {
    node('somelabel') {
      sh'''
        echo 'Hello, World!'
      '''
      try {
        // do something that fails
        sh "exit 1"
        currentBuild.result = 'SUCCESS'
      } catch (Exception err) {
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Information on which agent the steps are executed is not available at the moment.

# Enable Globally

You can enable this plugin globally in the Jenkins system configuration page, or with the [configuration as code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) plugin:

```
unclassified:
  logstashConfiguration:
    enableGlobally: true
    enabled: true
    logstashIndexer:
        logstash:
            host: "localhost"
            port: 9200
```

# JobProperty

This component streams individual log lines to the indexer for post-processing, along with any build data that is available at the start (some information such as the build status is unavailable or incomplete).

# Post-Build Publisher

This component pushes the tail of the job's log to the indexer for post-processing, along with all build data at the time the post-build action had started (if any post-build actions are scheduled after this plugin they will not be recorded).

# JSON Payload Format

Example payload sent to the indexer (e.g. RabbitMQ) using the post-build action component.

*Note 1: when the build wrapper is used, some information such as the build result will be missing or incomplete, and the "message" array will contain a single log line.*

*Note 2: `data.testResults` will only be present if a publisher records your test results in the build, for example by using the [JUnit Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/).*

---

SECURITY-1754 / CVE-2020-2134 (constructors) & CVE-2020-2135 (GroovyInterceptable)
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin 1.70 and earlier can be
circumvented through:

* Crafted constructor calls and bodies
* Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`

This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1723 / CVE-2020-2136
Git Plugin 4.2.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the
repository URL for Microsoft TFS field form validation.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

SECURITY-1784 / CVE-2020-2137
Timestamper Plugin 1.11.1 and earlier does not escape or sanitize the HTML
formatting used to display the timestamps in console output for builds.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1700 / CVE-2020-2138
Cobertura Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish
Cobertura Coverage Report' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted
file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins
master or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1668 / CVE-2020-2139
Cobertura Plugin 1.15 and earlier does not validate file paths from the XML
file it parses.

This allows attackers able to control the coverage report content to
overwrite any file on the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1722 / CVE-2020-2140
Audit Trail Plugin 3.2 and earlier does not escape the error message for
the URL Patterns field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can
also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by
users with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1765 / CVE-2020-2141 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2142 (missing permission check)
P4 Plugin 1.10.10 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several
HTTP endpoints. This allows users with Overall/Read access to trigger
builds or add labels in the Perforce repository.

Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a
cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1516 / CVE-2020-2143
Logstash Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file
`jenkins.plugins.logstash.LogstashConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins master
as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Logstash Plugin 2.3.1 and
earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-1702 / CVE-2020-2144
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.6 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to
prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows a user with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins parse a crafted
HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-1596 / CVE-2020-2145
Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin 1.9.1 and earlier stores its
Zephyr password in plain text in the global configuration file
`com.thed.zephyr.jenkins.reporter.ZeeReporter.xml`. This password can be
viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

SECURITY-1692 / CVE-2020-2146
Mac Plugin 1.1.0 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when
connecting to Mac Cloud host launched by the plugin. This lack of
validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept
these connections to build agents.

SECURITY-1761 / CVE-2020-2147 (CSRF) & CVE-2020-2148 (missing permission check)
Mac Plugin 1.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH host using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

SECURITY-1520 / CVE-2020-2149
Repository Connector Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration
file
`org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.repositoryconnector.RepositoryConfiguration.xml`
on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Repository Connector Plugin
1.2.6 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1523 / CVE-2020-2150
Sonar Quality Gates Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration
file `org.quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Sonar Quality Gates Plugin
1.3.1 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1519 / CVE-2020-2151
Quality Gates Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file
`quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins master as
part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Quality Gates Plugin 2.5
and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser
extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1727 / CVE-2020-2152
Subversion Release Manager Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not escape the error
message for the Repository URL field form validation.

This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can
also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by
users with Job/Configure permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1510 / CVE-2020-2153
Backlog Plugin stores credentials in job `config.xml` files as part of its
configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Backlog Plugin 2.4 and
earlier. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1550 / CVE-2020-2154
Zephyr for JIRA Test Management Plugin 1.5 and earlier stores Jira
credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
`com.thed.zephyr.jenkins.reporter.ZfjReporter.xml` on the Jenkins master.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the master file
system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1518 / CVE-2020-2155
OpenShift Deployer Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration
file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.openshift.DeployApplication.xml` on the Jenkins
master as part of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by OpenShift Deployer Plugin
1.2.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through
browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1511 / CVE-2020-2156
DeployHub Plugin stores credentials in job `config.xml` files as part of
its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by DeployHub Plugin 8.0.14 and
earlier. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1522 / CVE-2020-2157
Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stores credentials in job `config.xml` files as part
of its configuration.

While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form by Skytap Cloud CI Plugin 2.07
and earlier. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1750 / CVE-2020-2158
Literate Plugin 1.0 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to
prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code
execution vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input
files to Literate Plugin's build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1635 / CVE-2020-2159
CryptoMove Plugin 0.1.33 and earlier allows the configuration of an OS
command to execute as part of its build step configuration.

This command will be executed on the Jenkins master as the OS user account
running Jenkins, allowing user with Job/Configure permission to execute an
arbitrary OS command on the Jenkins master.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
