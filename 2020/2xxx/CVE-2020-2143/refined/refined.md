Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-2143:

**CVE-2020-2143**

*   **Root Cause:** The Logstash Plugin transmits credentials in plain text as part of its configuration form. Although the credentials are encrypted on disk, they are not encrypted during transmission.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin exposes credentials during the configuration process by sending them unencrypted.
*   **Impact:** The plain text transmission of credentials can lead to their exposure through browser extensions, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, or similar scenarios.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could potentially intercept or observe the unencrypted credential transmission when a user configures the Logstash plugin, possibly via browser extensions, XSS attacks, or network sniffing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific attacker position is mentioned but the attacker would need to be able to observe network traffic or have access to browser extensions or exploit XSS.
