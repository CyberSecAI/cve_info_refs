- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read issue existed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read leading to kernel memory disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user may be able to cause unexpected system termination or read kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Local user access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user on the affected system.
