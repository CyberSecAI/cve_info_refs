Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27996:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-27996, as it includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, its exploitation, and the associated fix, as well as the commit that addresses the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the custom deserialization of untrusted user-supplied data in the SmartStoreNET framework.
- Specifically, the `CustomProperties` dictionary within the `ModelBase` class is populated via a custom deserialization mechanism, which is vulnerable to type confusion.
- The `SmartModelBinder` class performs custom deserialization, converting form data into objects using their `__Type__` property and populating other properties by calling public setters.
- This custom deserialization logic does not perform sufficient validation, which allows an attacker to specify a type and its property values, leading to potential code execution.
- Complex types transported via `ModelBase.CustomProperties` are required to be decorated with the `CustomModelPartAttribute`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, allowing the attacker to specify types and properties.
- **Lack of Type Validation:** The custom deserialization process does not adequately validate the specified object type, allowing for the instantiation of arbitrary classes within the application.
- **Missing Security Attribute Enforcement:** While the `CustomModelPartAttribute` was introduced as a safeguard for complex types, the vulnerability existed before the enforcement of this attribute.
- **Public Setter Invocation:** The vulnerability relies on public setters of a class being called during deserialization and potentially triggering code execution.
- **Type Confusion:** By manipulating the `__Type__` parameter, an attacker can instantiate a different class than intended.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Compromise of System:** The impact of code execution could range from data exfiltration, to the installation of malware, to a full compromise of the system running the SmartStoreNET application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP POST requests.
- **Form-encoded data:** The attacker crafts specific form-encoded parameters within the POST request.
- **`__Type__` Parameter:** A key parameter is `CustomProperties[ProviderConfigData].__Type__`, which specifies the type to instantiate.
- **Property values:** The attacker includes additional parameters like `CustomProperties[ProviderConfigData].PropertyName` which are used to set the public setters of the object.
- **Image Upload:** In the documented exploit, the attack requires a malicious .NET assembly to be uploaded through the avatar upload feature, which must be available on the server.
- **AddressAdd endpoint (Requires Authentication):** The documented exploit uses the `addressadd` endpoint, which requires authentication but user accounts can be easily registered.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable SmartStoreNET server.
- **Authenticated User:** The `addressadd` endpoint requires the attacker to have an authenticated user account.
- **Malicious assembly:** In the demonstrated exploit, the attacker needs to have the ability to upload a specially crafted .NET assembly to the server.
- **Knowledge of target type and property names:** The attacker needs to know about the class names, property names, and assembly names that are used by the server.

**7. Additional Information from the Content:**

-   The GitHub Security Lab report provides a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious .NET assembly using the avatar upload feature and then using `System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller` in a specially crafted request.
-   The fix for this vulnerability involves enforcing the `CustomModelPartAttribute` before the complex types are being instantiated by the `SmartModelBinder` class.
-   The vulnerability is not limited to the `addressadd` endpoint, as any other controller endpoint that deserializes properties through `CustomProperties` is also vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2020-27996 is a critical security flaw that stems from insecure deserialization. By carefully crafting requests, an attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution. The provided information reveals the technical details of this vulnerability as well as a practical exploit scenario that can be used by an attacker to achieve code execution.
