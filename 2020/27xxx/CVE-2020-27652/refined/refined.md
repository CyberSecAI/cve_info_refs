Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27652:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an algorithm downgrade issue in the Synology QuickConnect feature. When a user attempts to connect to their router remotely via QuickConnect, the system initially tries to establish a secure HTTPS connection. However, an attacker can manipulate the connection process to force a downgrade to an unencrypted HTTP connection. This is due to a combination of factors:
1.  The OpenVPN client used for the QuickConnect tunnel is configured with `--cipher none` which disables encryption on the VPN data channel.
2.  The QuickConnect server, in its response to a tunnel request, provides both an HTTPS and a non-HTTPS (HTTP) endpoint for the tunnel. A failed HTTPS connection will cause the client to try the provided HTTP connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Algorithm Downgrade:** The primary weakness is the ability to force a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP. This allows the attacker to intercept the unencrypted traffic.
*   **Unencrypted VPN Data Channel:** The use of `--cipher none` in the OpenVPN configuration means that data transmitted through the VPN is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping if a man-in-the-middle attack is achieved.
*   **Lack of Proper HTTPS Enforcement:** The system does not enforce HTTPS communication and provides an alternative HTTP path if HTTPS fails.
*   **Missing Secure Cookie Flag**: As noted in the related CVE-2020-27650, the lack of a secure flag on session cookies allows attackers to capture cookies over an unencrypted channel. This contributes to the overall attack scenario when combined with the downgrade.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can capture the plaintext traffic between the user's browser, the QuickConnect server and the Synology router's web interface. This includes sensitive data like session cookies.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By capturing session cookies, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the router's management interface.
*   **Full Control of Router:** Once logged in, an attacker has full control over the compromised router, potentially leading to further malicious activities such as data manipulation, network compromise, malware installation etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attack relies on an attacker being able to intercept traffic between the Synology router and the QuickConnect servers. This can be done by redirecting traffic to the attacker's machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be positioned in the network to intercept and redirect traffic. This means they need to be on the network path between the Synology router and the QuickConnect servers.
*   **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This would likely require controlling the network infrastructure.
*   **OpenVPN Server Setup:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a fake OpenVPN server to trick the Synology router into attempting a connection.
*  **Technical understanding:** The attacker needs to understand the QuickConnect connection process, including how the tunnel is established, the OpenVPN configuration, and the request/response flow.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is more easily exploitable when the router's "redirect HTTP to HTTPS" and "Enable HSTS" options are disabled, which are the default settings.
*   The provided CVSS score of 8.3 reflects the high severity of the vulnerability, due to the potential for complete compromise of the router.

In summary, CVE-2020-27652 describes a flaw in the Synology SRM/DSM QuickConnect feature where an attacker can force a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing them to intercept sensitive information and potentially gain full control over the user's router.
