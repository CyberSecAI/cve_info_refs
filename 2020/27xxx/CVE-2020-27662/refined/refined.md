**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The `ajax/comments.php` file in GLPI is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). This means that the application doesn't properly validate user authorization when accessing objects directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with a logged-in account (even a self-service profile) can read data from any tables within the GLPI database (e.g., `glpi_tickets`, `glpi_users`).
*   This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about tickets, users, and other data stored in GLPI.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `ajax/comments.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid, logged-in account in GLPI. A self-service profile is sufficient.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in GLPI version 9.5.3.
