Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27036:

**CVE-2020-27036**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability exists within the `phNxpNciHal_core_initialize` function in the NFC component. The provided commit message states "Prevent OOB read in phNxpNciHal_core_initialize".
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the code attempts to access a memory location outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by causing the NFC service to crash due to the OOB read. It could potentially also lead to information disclosure by reading sensitive data from outside the allocated memory.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability resides in the NFC HAL, suggesting the attack vector could involve interactions with NFC functionalities. The referenced commit fixes a bug in the function that initializes the NFC core. Therefore, any process that would cause that initialization to be triggered could be an attack vector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would likely need to be able to trigger the NFC initialization function, which could be done via an app with permissions, or by malicious intent via other means.
