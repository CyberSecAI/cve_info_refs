# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

powerpc/rtas: Restrict RTAS requests from userspaceA number of userspace utilities depend on making calls to RTAS to retrieve
information and update various things.
The existing API through which we expose RTAS to userspace exposes more
RTAS functionality than we actually need, through the sys\_rtas syscall,
which allows root (or anyone with CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN) to make any RTAS call they
want with arbitrary arguments.
Many RTAS calls take the address of a buffer as an argument, and it's up to
the caller to specify the physical address of the buffer as an argument. We
allocate a buffer (the "RMO buffer") in the Real Memory Area that RTAS can
access, and then expose the physical address and size of this buffer in
/proc/powerpc/rtas/rmo\_buffer. Userspace is expected to read this address,
poke at the buffer using /dev/mem, and pass an address in the RMO buffer to
the RTAS call.
However, there's nothing stopping the caller from specifying whatever
address they want in the RTAS call, and it's easy to construct a series of
RTAS calls that can overwrite arbitrary bytes (even without /dev/mem
access).
Additionally, there are some RTAS calls that do potentially dangerous
things and for which there are no legitimate userspace use cases.
In the past, this would not have been a particularly big deal as it was
assumed that root could modify all system state freely, but with Secure
Boot and lockdown we need to care about this.
We can't fundamentally change the ABI at this point, however we can address
this by implementing a filter that checks RTAS calls against a list
of permitted calls and forces the caller to use addresses within the RMO
buffer.
The list is based off the list of calls that are used by the librtas
userspace library, and has been tested with a number of existing userspace
RTAS utilities. For compatibility with any applications we are not aware of
that require other calls, the filter can be turned off at build time.

Subject: Linux kernel: powerpc: RTAS calls can be used to compromise kernel
 integrity

The Linux kernel for powerpc has an issue with the Run-Time Abstraction
Services (RTAS) interface, allowing root (or CAP_SYS_ADMIN users) in a
VM to overwrite some parts of memory, including kernel memory.

This issue impacts guests running on top of PowerVM or KVM hypervisors
(pseries platform), and does *not* impact bare-metal machines (powernv
platform).

Description
===========

The RTAS interface, defined in the Power Architecture Platform
Reference, provides various platform hardware services to operating
systems running on PAPR platforms (e.g. the "pseries" platform in Linux,
running in a LPAR/VM on PowerVM or KVM).

Some userspace daemons require access to certain RTAS calls for system
maintenance and monitoring purposes.

The kernel exposes a syscall, sys_rtas, that allows root (or any user
with CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to make arbitrary RTAS calls. For the RTAS calls
which require a work area, it allocates a buffer (the "RMO buffer") and
exposes the physical address in /proc so that the userspace tool can
pass addresses within that buffer as an argument to the RTAS call.

The syscall doesn't check that the work area arguments to RTAS calls are
within the RMO buffer, which makes it trivial to read and write to any
guest physical address within the LPAR's Real Memory Area, including
overwriting the guest kernel's text.

At the time the RTAS syscall interface was first developed, it was
generally assumed that root had unlimited ability to modify system
state, so this would not have been considered an integrity violation.
However, with the advent of Secure Boot, Lockdown etc, root should not
be able to arbitrarily modify the kernel text or read arbitrary kernel data.

Therefore, while this issue impacts all kernels since the RTAS interface
was first implemented, we are only considering it a vulnerability for
upstream kernels from 5.3 onwards, which is when the Lockdown LSM was
merged. Lockdown was widely included in pre-5.3 distribution kernels, so
distribution vendors should consider whether they need to backport the
patch to their pre-5.3 distro trees.

(A CVE for this issue is pending; we requested one some time ago but it
has not yet been assigned.)

Fixes
=====

A patch is currently in powerpc-next[0] and is expected to be included
in mainline kernel 5.10. The patch has not yet been backported to
upstream stable trees.

The approach taken by the patch is to maintain the existing RTAS
interface, but restrict requests to the list of RTAS calls actually used
by the librtas userspace library, and restrict work area pointer
arguments to the region within the RMO buffer.

All RTAS-using applications that we are aware of are system
management/monitoring tools, maintained by IBM, that use the librtas
library. We don't anticipate there being any real world legitimate
applications that require an RTAS call that isn't in the librtas list,
however if such an application exists, the filtering can be disabled by
a Kconfig option specified during kernel build.
