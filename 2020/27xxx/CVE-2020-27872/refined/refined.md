Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27872

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper state tracking within the password recovery process of the `mini_httpd` service on affected NETGEAR routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication.
*   **Improper State Tracking:** The `mini_httpd` service does not properly track the state during the password recovery process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete Compromise:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability, possibly in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to execute code with root privileges on the router.
*   **Full Control:** Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the router by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Adjacent Attack:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
*   **TCP Port 80:** The `mini_httpd` service, which is vulnerable, listens on TCP port 80 by default.
*   **Password Recovery Process:** The attack targets the password recovery functionality of the router's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the targeted NETGEAR router.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to NETGEAR on 2020-08-21.
*   A fix was released by NETGEAR and is available as a firmware update for the affected routers.

**Affected Products:**

*   Netgear R7450 is specifically mentioned as vulnerable by ZDI.
*   Netgear advisory lists a large number of potentially vulnerable models. The advisory specifies that these models are fixed by the listed firmware versions. These include models such as AC2100, AC2400, AC2600, R6700v2, R6800, R6900v2, R7200, R7350, R7400, R6220, R6230, R6260, R6330, R6350, R6850, R6120, R6020, and R6080.
