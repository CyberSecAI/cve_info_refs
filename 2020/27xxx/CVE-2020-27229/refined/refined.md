Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-27229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `patientslist.do` page within the OpenClinic GA application, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the parameters `findPersonID`, `findSector`, and `findDistrict` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-provided input from the `findPersonID`, `findSector`, and `findDistrict` parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized data access
    - Data modification
    - Data deletion
    - Potential complete database compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/openclinic/patientslist.do` endpoint.
- Specifically, malicious SQL code is inserted into the `findPersonID`, `findSector` or `findDistrict` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the OpenClinic GA application. This means they would require valid user credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Specific Vulnerability Details for CVE-2020-27229:**
- **Parameter:** `findPersonID`
- **Code Location:** The vulnerable code is located in `net.admin.AdminPerson.java` where the SQL query is constructed dynamically using the `findPersonID` parameter.
- **Vulnerable Code:** `sSQLWhere = sSQLWhere + " a.personid = " + sPersonID + " AND";`
- The provided example request demonstrates how to inject SQL code via the `findPersonID` parameter: `findPersonID=<SQLINJECTION>`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report also describes similar SQL injection vulnerabilities with `findSector` (CVE-2020-27230) and `findDistrict` (CVE-2020-27231).
- The provided CVSSv3 score is 6.4 which indicates a medium severity vulnerability.
