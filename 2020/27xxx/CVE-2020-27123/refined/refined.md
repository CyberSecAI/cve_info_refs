Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an exposed Inter-Process Communication (IPC) function in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- An exposed IPC function allows for the sending of crafted messages to the AnyConnect process.
- Lack of proper access control or input validation for the IPC function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a local attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker access to the vulnerable system is required.
- The attacker exploits the exposed IPC function.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated locally on the target system
- Ability to send crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows releases earlier than 4.9.03047.
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.5.
- No public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability are known to Cisco PSIRT.
- There are no known workarounds, and the only fix is to upgrade to a patched version.
