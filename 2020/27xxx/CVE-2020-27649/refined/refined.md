Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the improper certificate validation within the OpenVPN client used by the QuickConnect feature of Synology Router Manager (SRM). The `--syno-no-verify` option, a custom addition to OpenVPN, disables crucial SSL verification checks, leading to a bypass of certificate validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:**  The custom `--syno-no-verify` option in OpenVPN client allows connection to a server without proper certificate verification. This option was intended to skip certificate checks, but it leaves the system vulnerable.
*   **Logic Error:** Although the `verify_callback` function sets a `verified` flag to `false` when the certificate is invalid, the authentication process using user/password happens before this check is performed. This allows an attacker to steal the user/password sent over the VPN tunnel, even if the TLS connection is not verified later on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept the VPN connection established by the Synology router's QuickConnect feature.
*   **Credential Theft:** By impersonating the legitimate OpenVPN server, an attacker can capture the VPN credentials (username and password) used by the router.
*   **Router Impersonation:** With the stolen VPN credentials, the attacker can impersonate the router and connect to the QuickConnect endpoint.
*   **Further Credential Theft:** The attacker can further set up a fake web server that mimics the Synology router login page and steal the router's admin credentials when a user attempts to log in through the compromised connection.
*   **Full Router Control:** Ultimately, the attacker can gain full control over the user's Synology router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Level:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to be able to intercept the traffic between the Synology router and the QuickConnect server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attacker must be able to perform a MITM attack by redirecting traffic intended for the legitimate QuickConnect server to their own malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept and redirect traffic. This could be an attacker on the same LAN, or an attacker who has compromised a network device along the path between the router and the quick connect server.
*   **Malicious OpenVPN Server:** The attacker needs to set up their own OpenVPN server that responds on port 443, impersonating the genuine QuickConnect server, and is able to receive authentication requests.
*   **Fake Web Server:** The attacker needs to set up a fake webserver that imitates the Synology router login page in order to steal the router credentials.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with OpenVPN, networking, and basic web server setup.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists in Synology SRM versions before 1.2.4-8081.
* The attack involves multiple steps, but from a user perspective, the attack is virtually indistinguishable from normal operation.
* This vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-27653, which is also related to QuickConnect.
