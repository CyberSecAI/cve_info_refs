The provided content is related to CVE-2020-27557.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insecure storage of video-stream user credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The password used to access the video stream is stored in plain text in a SQLite database (`/etc/user.db`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the system can extract the plain-text password.
- If the user changed the password, an attacker can still gain access to the video stream using the extracted password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the device to extract the `/etc/user.db` file.
- Remote access via another vulnerability such as the webserver serving `/etc` or the telnet service to extract the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have either physical access to the device or remote access through other vulnerabilities to obtain the SQLite database.
