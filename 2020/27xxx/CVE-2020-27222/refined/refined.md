Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27222:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete internal state distinction within the Eclipse Californium library. Specifically, the `DefaultCipherSuiteSelector.checkCertificateSupport` field incorrectly retains a "false" state after a failed certificate-based DTLS handshake due to TLS parameter mismatch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect State Management:** The DTLS server-side fails to reset its internal state after a failed handshake.
*   **Incomplete TLS Parameter Check:** The software assumes that TLS parameters for certificate-based handshakes have been checked, even when they haven't been for new handshakes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly trigger a failed certificate-based DTLS handshake with TLS parameter mismatches. This forces the server into an incorrect state where subsequent legitimate certificate-based handshakes will fail.
*   **Server Unavailability:** The DTLS server becomes unresponsive to certificate-based handshakes until it is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can send malicious DTLS handshake requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Certificate-based Handshakes:** The vulnerability is specific to certificate-based DTLS handshakes (x509 and RPK).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   **DTLS Client:** The attacker must be capable of initiating DTLS handshakes with the server.
*   **TLS Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft DTLS handshake requests with intentionally mismatched TLS parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Eclipse Californium versions 2.3.0 to 2.6.0 are affected.
*   **Fixed Version:**  The vulnerability is resolved in version 2.6.1 of Eclipse Californium.
*  **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-372: Incomplete Internal State Distinction.
*  The vulnerability is present on the DTLS server side of the application.
*  The vulnerability does not affect PSK based handshakes
