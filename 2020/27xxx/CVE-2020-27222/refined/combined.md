| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c0)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 08:57:17 EST  ``` Failing to negotiation TLS parameter for a certificate based DTLS handshake causes future certificate based handshakes to fail until a restart.  See  Reported bug: <https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/issues/964>  Bugfix: <https://github.com/eclipse/californium/pull/1528>  Bugfix Release 2.6.1 scheduled for Thursday, 04. Feb. 2021: <https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.californium/releases/2.6.1> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c1)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 09:19:26 EST  ``` Hi Wayne,  the bug was detected yesterday on analysing a bug reported by a leshan user. I fixed it immediately and we got the verification from that user today.  All Californium version 2.3-2.6, and all Leshan versions using one of these versions are affected. Though Hono supports currently only PSK, it's not affected.  My current plan is to release the Bugfix with 2.6.1 on Thursday. I'm not sure, if Eclipse "demands" to release also bugfix versions for the previous and also affected releases. Please advice ...  Best regards Achim Kraus ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c2)  Simon Bernard [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 09:32:42 EST  ``` Achim we agree this affects only x509 use case (not PSK nor RPK)?  > I'm not sure, if Eclipse "demands" to release also bugfix > versions for the previous and also affected releases  I guess you're free to decide which versions are targeted for security fixes.  But maybe you should inform users by adding a Security Policy in github ? (e.g. : <https://github.com/eclipse/leshan/security/policy>) ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c3)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 09:38:17 EST  ``` > Achim we agree this affects only x509 use case (not PSK nor RPK)?  FMPOV, RPK is "certificate based". It uses the "certificate type" "raw_public_key".  Do you have any doubt about PSK? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c4)  Kai Hudalla [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 09:39:49 EST  ``` Achim,  you will also need to determine the CWE code [1] to use for this vulnerability and come up with a reasonable description that can be included in the CVE.  [1] <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c5)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 10:04:30 EST  ``` FMPOV  <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/372.html>  Incomplete Internal State Distinction  "The software does not properly determine which state it is in, causing it to assume it is in state X when in fact it is in state Y, causing it to perform incorrect operations in a security-relevant manner."  The state of the field "DefaultCipherSuiteSelector.checkCertificateSupport" sticks to "false", and so the software assumes, that the tls parameter for certificate based handshakes are already checked. But they are not checked for new handshakes and so cause these new handshakes to fail as well. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c6)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-02 10:13:48 EST  ``` > But maybe you should inform users by adding a Security Policy in github ?

Copy and adapt, I don't know maybe there is no plan to support security fix for 1.x in californium ?

I guess that depends on whether we (or better: the two of you) agree to the support model that Achim has outlined on GitHub. My understanding of that is that we (you) want to support the latest released version only, right? ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c20)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-04 08:04:51 EST  ``` > support the latest released version only, right?

(Previous releases only, if some is requesting that).  The discussion is currently more about to use version numbers in the "security policy" or not.  <https://github.com/bosch-io/californium/blob/add_sec_policy/SECURITY.md>  FMPOV, this is not that important and may be adapted in the future.   So, my question is now, what should the next step be:  a) 1. write the release e-mail for 2.6.1 users (not explicit including the not published CVE) (Achim) 2. publish the CVE (Wayne) 3. write again a e-mail to the users (Achim)  b) 1. publish the CVE (Wayne) 2. write the release e-mail for 2.6.1 users including CVE (Achim)  c) ??? ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c23)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-04 15:44:46 EST  ``` The CVE is published with a pointer to this issue for more information. This issue has already been disclosed to the community. We need you to turn the "committers only" option off.   If you want to push a security advisory on GitHub, you should be able to do everything except for push the button to publish it. For that you'll need somebody with administrator level access (I can do this on your behalf when/if you're ready). ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c24)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-04 16:14:09 EST  ``` I tried to follow:  <https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/creating-a-security-advisory>  But that button "new draft security advisory" is not available (for me).  Is there a different way to do it? ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=570844#c25)  Achim Kraus [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-05 04:57:11 EST  ``` Leshan and Californium are released. e-Mails are send to the users.  Is it now OK, to set this bug to resolved?

Regarding the github documentation[1], I guess I should see a "New draft security advisory" button in "Security advisories" tab, but I can't.  (Tested on Leshan repository where I'm project lead and Californium where I'm committer)  Did I missed something ?
