Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information when the Moxa Service is enabled on NPort IA5000A series devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319):** Data transmitted through the Moxa Service is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read all traffic sent when Moxa Service is enabled, potentially exposing:
  - Authentication credentials
  - Device configurations
  - Device version information
  - Other sensitive data

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, requiring network access to UDP port 4800 or TCP port 4900.
- A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is required to intercept the unencrypted traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to perform a MitM attack.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target device.
- The attacker needs to induce user interaction by making a user utilize clients of the Moxa service like DSU and NPort search utility.
- High skill level is required to successfully conduct a MitM attack

**Additional Details (from Kaspersky ICS CERT):**
- The Kaspersky ICS CERT advisory provides a more detailed CVSS score ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)), highlighting the high attack complexity and the confidentiality impact.
- It also suggests mitigation strategies, including:
  - Disabling the Moxa Service
  - Setting up firewalls to restrict access to ports 4800/UDP and 4900/TCP to authorized parties only
  - Utilizing VPNs for secure remote access
  - Implementing NIDS for network monitoring
  - Network segmentation.
