{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The device configuration export contains user passwords and other sensitive data in plaintext when a 'Pre-shared key' is not set.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unprotected Storage of Credentials (CWE-256)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract authentication credentials from a configuration file sent over an insecure communication channel. This data can be used to authenticate with the NPort services and change the deviceâ€™s configuration.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept the configuration file during export/import over the network (ports 80/TCP or 4900/TCP).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the device via ports 80/TCP or 4900/TCP. A high skill level is required to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack. User interaction is required because the user needs to export/import the configuration without the 'Pre-shared key'."
