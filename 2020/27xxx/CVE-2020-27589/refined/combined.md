4. Certificate Validation Disabled in Black Duck API Wrapper

November 05, 2020
## Certificate Validation Disabled in Black Duck API Wrapper

These days, security practitioners place a considerable amount of effort into securing their organization’s applications with secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) programs. One piece of the puzzle in an organization’s secure SDLC is typically a set of security tools (SAST, DAST, IAST, SCA…) running in one or more CI/CD pipelines. These tools are meant to help the organization keep an eye on the security posture of their applications. As an example, SCA tools like Black Duck watch the third-party components utilized by applications to ensure that the components do not contain any known vulnerabilities. But who watches the watchers?

Optiv has identified a security vulnerability in the Black Duck Hub REST API Python project that is listed in the PyPI repository under the name “blackduck.” This issue has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2020-27589. When reviewing the API wrapper’s source code, Optiv found that despite having a configuration option for disabling HTTPS certificate validation, three instances existed where certificate validation was always disabled. This allowed network attackers to intercept and modify sensitive data in transit from the API wrapper to the Black Duck server.

### Vulnerability Details

The API wrapper makes HTTPS requests to the Black Duck server using the Python requests library. For individual requests made using this library, certificate validation can be enabled or disabled using the optional argument “verify.” Most of the methods in the API wrapper use the configuration option “insecure” to set the value of the “verify” argument. This allows the user to specify if certificate validation should be enforced or not.

def get\_projects(self, limit=100, parameters={}):

headers = self.get\_headers()

if limit:

parameters.update({'limit': limit})

url = self.\_get\_projects\_url() + self.\_get\_parameter\_string(parameters)

headers['Accept'] = 'application/vnd.blackducksoftware.project-detail-4+json'

logger.debug(f"Retrieving projects using url {url}")

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify = not self.config['insecure'])

jsondata = response.json()

return jsondata

**Figure 1: HubRestApi.py version 0.0.51 line 673-682**

The “upload\_scan” method is used to upload scan results to the Black Duck server. The following application source code shows that the scan results are uploaded to the server via the Python requests library. Notice in both cases, the “verify” argument is set to the literal “False” instead of using the configuration option “insecure” as is done throughout the application. This means that the requests made using this method will always have certificate validation disabled, even when the user configures the library to enforce certificate validation. This instance was present in the API wrapper from version 0.0.28 - 0.0.52.

def upload\_scan(self, filename):

url = self.get\_apibase() + "/scan/data/?mode=replace"

headers = self.get\_headers()

if filename.endswith('.json') or filename.endswith('.jsonld'):

headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/ld+json'

with open(filename,"r") as f:

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=f, verify=False)

elif filename.endswith('.bdio'):

headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/vnd.blackducksoftware.bdio+zip'

with open(filename,"rb") as f:

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=f, verify=False)

else:

raise Exception("Unkown file type")

return response

**Figure 2: HubRestApi.py version 0.0.51 line 1282-1295**

The “download\_project\_scans” method is used to download scan results from the Black Duck server. Notice that the same issue exists where the “verify” argument is set to the value “False” to disable certificate validation in all cases. This instance was present in the API wrapper from version 0.0.25 - 0.0.52.

def download\_project\_scans(self, project\_name,version\_name, output\_folder=None):

version = self.get\_project\_version\_by\_name(project\_name,version\_name)

codelocations = self.get\_version\_codelocations(version)

import os

if output\_folder:

if not os.path.exists(output\_folder):

os.makedirs(output\_folder, 0o755, True)

result = []

for item in codelocations['items']:

links = item['\_meta']['links']

matches = [x for x in links if x['rel'] == 'enclosure']

for m in matches:

url = m['href']

filename = url.split('/')[6]

if output\_folder:

pathname = os.path.join(output\_folder, filename)

else:

if not os.path.exists(project\_name):

os.mkdir(project\_name)

pathname = os.path.join(project\_name, filename)

responce = requests.get(url, headers=self.get\_headers(), stream=True, verify=False)

with open(pathname, "wb") as f:

for data in responce.iter\_content():

f.write(data)

result.append({filename, pathname})

return result

**Figure 3: HubRestApi.py version 0.0.51 line 1297-1324**

### Exploitation - bd-offline-scanning-solution

One of the publicly available projects that used a vulnerable version of the API wrapper was the “bd-offline-scanning-solution” project. This project, currently maintained by Synopsys, allows Black Duck users in restricted environments to perform offline scans and to upload the results to the Black Duck server at a later time. The source code below shows that the vulnerable “upload\_scan” method is used by the project.

manifest = json.load(open(args.manifest, 'r'))

for file in manifest['scan\_files']:

[...]

#

# Upload the scan file

#

logging.debug(msg)

logging.debug(hub.upload\_scan(file\_to\_upload))

if temp\_file and not args.keep:

logging.debug("removing temp file {}".format(file\_to\_upload))

os.remove(file\_to\_upload)

elif temp\_file:

logging.debug("preserving temp file {}".format(file\_to\_upload))

**Figure 4: blackducksoftware/bd-offline-scanning-solution/upload\_scans.py line 45-107**

If an attacker has knowledge of this vulnerability and is able to intercept and modify network traffic between the system running the offline scanner solution and the Black Duck server, they could both view or modify scan results in transit to the Black Duck server. This would allow the attacker to know what components the scanned application is using so that they could research vulnerabilities in the components separately. Additionally, an advanced attacker could potentially modify the bill of materials in flight, causing some components that were identified by Black Duck at scan time to not show up in the Black Duck web interface. An advanced attacker could use this ability to intentionally filter out known-vulnerable components so that the development team’s application remains vulnerable.

### Vendor Remediation

To fix this issue, the vendor team modified the API wrapper to respect the user’s configuration options to allow the use of TLS to secure communications between the API wrapper and the Black Duck server in all cases. When the API wrapper is configured to enforce certificate validation, it will reject invalid, self-signed, revoked and expired certificates.

The vulnerable code was updated to instead set the “verify” parameter using the “insecure” configuration option. This allows the user to decide if certificate validation should be enforced or not.

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, verify = not self.config['insecure'])

The vendor released version 0.0.53 which includes a fix for this issue. Additionally, Optiv recommends that users configure the API wrapper to enforce certificate validation at all times by setting the configuration value “insecure” to “false.”

Optiv disclosed a vulnerability in the “blackduck” package on PyPI that was remediated by Synopsys. This vulnerability is a reminder that every bit of code used by an organization is attack surface, even the tools that are meant to aid in securing the organization’s applications. When integrating these tools into your CI/CD pipelines, be sure to take the time to properly secure the integration.

# Overview

The hub-rest-api-python provides Python bindings for Hub REST API.

# Paging and Black Duck v2022.2

In v2022.2 of Black Duck the REST API introduced a max page size to protect system resource usage. See the Black Duck [release notes on Synopsys Community](https://community.synopsys.com/s/article/Black-Duck-Release-Notes) for the details of which API endpoints are affected. Users of the the python bindings here should leverage the Client interface which provides automatic paging support to make best use of these endpoints.

**The old HubInstance interface and many of the examples using it do not perform paging and will break as a result of the changes in v2022.2**.

Any issues related to the HubInstance Interface will be closed as *Won't Fix*

Any PRs with new or modified example scripts/utilities **must** use the client interface.

# New in 1.0.0

Introducing the new Client class.

In order to provide a more robust long-term connection, faster performance, and an overall better experience a new
Client class has been designed.

It is backed by a [Requests session](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects) object. The user specifies a base URL, timeout, retries, proxies, and TLS verification upon initialization and these attributes are persisted across all requests.

At the REST API level, the Client class provides a consistent way to discover and traverse public resources, uses a
[generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) to fetch all items using pagination, and automatically renews the bearer token.

See [Client versus HubInstance Comparison](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python/wiki/Client-versus-HubInstance-Comparison) and also read the [Client User Guide](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python/wiki/Client-User-Guide) on the [Hub REST API Python Wiki](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python/wiki).

### Important Notes

The old HubInstance (in HubRestApi.py) keeps its existing functionality for backwards compatibility and therefore does **not** currently leverage any of the new features in the Client class.

We believe that the new features are compelling enough to strongly encourage users to consider moving from HubInstance to Client.
See [Client versus HubInstance Comparison](https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python/wiki/Client-versus-HubInstance-Comparison).

Please give it a try and let us know what you think!

# To use

```
pip3 install blackduck

```

```
from blackduck import Client
import logging
import os

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="[%(asctime)s] {%(module)s:%(lineno)d} %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)

bd = Client(
    token=os.environ.get('blackduck_token'),
    base_url="https://your.blackduck.url",
    # verify=False  # TLS certificate verification
)

for project in bd.get_resource(name='projects'):
    print(project.get('name'))
```

### Examples

Example code showing how to work with the new Client can be found in the *examples/client* folder.

**Examples which use the old HubInstance interface -which is not maintained- are not guaranteed to work. Use at your own risk.**

# Version History

Including a version history on a go-forward basis.

## v1.1.0

Retries will be attempted for all HTTP verbs, not just GET.

# Test

Using [pytest](https://pytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents.html)

```
git clone https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python.git
cd hub-rest-api-python
# optional but advisable: create/use virtualenv
# you should have 3.x+, e.g. Python 3.8.0+

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .
cd test
pytest
```

## Install package locally

Do this when testing a new version.

```
git clone https://github.com/blackducksoftware/hub-rest-api-python.git
cd hub-rest-api-python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install .

```

To uninstall:

```
pip3 uninstall blackduck

```

## Where can I get the latest release?
