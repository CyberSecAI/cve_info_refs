{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `cp_create` function within `libjasper/jpc/jpc_enc.c`. It occurs when the number of resolution levels (`numrlvls`) in the input is greater than a maximum value, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Use of untrusted input to control memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious input that triggers an out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or system instability.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted image file with a high `numrlvls` parameter to the Jasper image processing tool.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted input file to an application using the vulnerable Jasper library. No special privileges or specific system access is needed."
