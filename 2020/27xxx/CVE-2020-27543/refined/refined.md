    "1. Does content relate to the CVE?": "YES",
    "2. Extracted Vulnerability Information": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `restify-paginate` Node.js package version 0.0.5 is susceptible to a vulnerability due to insufficient HTTP header validation.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the HTTP Host header within the `restify-paginate` middleware. Specifically, when an HTTP request is made without a Host header, an uncaught exception occurs in the middleware causing the server to crash.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by crashing the server.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send any HTTP request without a `Host` header to a NetApp product using the vulnerable `restify-paginate` package.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be in any network position capable of sending HTTP requests to the affected NetApp product, no authentication or special capabilities are required."
