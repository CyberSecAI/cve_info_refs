{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `dmt_stree` member, used in the `dbAdjTree` function, can refer to the `stree` array in either the `dmaptree` or `dmapctl` structure. These structures have different sizes for their `stree` member, leading to a potential array-index-out-of-bounds vulnerability if the smaller `dmaptree.stree` is accessed with an index intended for the larger `dmapctl.stree`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Array-index-out-of-bounds",
      "Incorrect size check"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes could cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read, potentially crashing the system).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system is required",
     "Setting extended attributes on a JFS filesystem."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to set extended attributes on a JFS filesystem."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the JFS filesystem code, specifically in the dbAdjTree function within fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c. The fix involves using the larger array size when accessing dmt_stree, eliminating the out-of-bounds read.",
