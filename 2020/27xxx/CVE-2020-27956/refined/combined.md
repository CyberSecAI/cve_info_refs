##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020-10/images/cars.png?itok=S2dJT3tj)](/sites/default/files/2020-10/images/cars.png)

**Project: Car Rental Management System using PHP/MySQLi**

## **About**

The Car Rental Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that helps to manage a certain car rental business to manage their car rental records. This system has 2 sides which are the admin side the client-side. The admin side of the car rental management system is the side where the company's management manages the rental records and other related data needed such as the list of the company's cars for rent. The client-side or borrower side will be served as the booking website of the company for their clients. Each booked rentals will be verified by the car rental management to confirm the client's reliability and booking details. The car for rent is organized by their categories, transmission type, and engine type so that the borrowers can choose their desired car to rent by these data if the available car for his/her given pickup and drop-off date and time. This system stores the car's registration no and plate for the company's references for identifying if which car is used by the client and also identifies if the client already picked-up/Dropped-off his/her rented car.

## Features

### Admin Side

* **Login Page**
  + The page where the system admin or company's staff will submit their system credentials to access the data of the system.
* **Home Page**
  + The page where the system admin or staff will be redirected by default after logging into the system.
* **Car Category Page**
  + The page where all the company's rental car's categories are listed and managed.
* **Transmission Types Page**
  + The page where the car transmissions type is listed and managed.
* **Engine Types Page**
  + The page where the car engine types are listed and managed.
* **Cars Page**
  + The page where can the admin or staff user manages the list of cars for rent.
* **Users Page**
  + The page where the system admin manages the list of the system users and manages the credentials.
* **System Settings**
  + The page where the admin manages the system information.

### Client-Side

* **Home Page**
  + The page where the clients being redirected by default when browsing the car rental company's booking website. This page also shows the list of the company's cars for rent.
* **Available Cars Page**
  + The page where the list of available cars on the client's selected pickup date, drop off date and category are being displayed.

## How to Run

1. Download the source code and extract the **zip**file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs PHP script.
3. Open the web-server database and create a new database name it **car\_rental****\_db**.
4. Import the **SQL**file located in the database folder of the source code.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. Example for XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. E.g [**http://localhost/car-rental-management-system**] for the client-side and [**http://localhost/car-rental-management-system/admin**] for the admin/staff side.

## Admin Default Access

Username: admin

Password: admin123

I hope this simple Car Rental Management System will help you with what you are looking for. Feel free to download and modify the source code.

Enjoy!

Note: Due to the size or complexity of this submission, the author has submitted it as a .zip file to shorten your download time. After downloading it, you will need a program like Winzip to decompress it.

Virus note: All files are scanned once-a-day by SourceCodester.com for viruses, but new viruses come out every day, so no prevention program can catch 100% of them.

FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, PLEASE:

1. Re-scan downloaded files using your personal virus checker before using it.

2. NEVER, EVER run compiled files (.exe's, .ocx's, .dll's etc.)--only run source code.
