| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1906267#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2020-12-10 05:06:31 UTC  ``` Until the 4.6.6 version of OpenShift Container Platform changes to the router-default service to allow only certain IP source ranges was possible by directly editing the service object [1]. Since 4.6.6 changes to the loadBalancerSourceRanges field are overwritten to the default of all IP ranges. If a cluster is affected by this issue an attacker can use the flaw to access resources which should be restricted to the specified IP ranges.  [1] <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5158751>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1906267#c4)  Jason Shepherd    2020-12-10 05:12:24 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/openshift/cluster-ingress-operator/pull/507>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1906267#c5)  Jason Shepherd    2020-12-14 22:59:35 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Move the allowed IP source ranges from the loadBalancerSourceRanges setting to "service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges" annotation. For example:   oc -n openshift-ingress annotate svc/router-default service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1906267#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-21 13:23:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6  Via RHSA-2020:5614 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5614](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5614)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1906267#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-12-21 13:31:04 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
