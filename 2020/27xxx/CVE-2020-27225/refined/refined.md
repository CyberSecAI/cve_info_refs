Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27225:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for active help requests in the Eclipse Help subsystem. The `livehelp` endpoint allows execution of arbitrary commands within the Eclipse application without verifying the source of the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The `livehelp` endpoint, which allows the execution of commands, does not require any form of authentication. This allows unauthenticated requests to be processed.
*   **Use of GET requests:** The `livehelp` endpoint used GET requests, which can change the state of the system.
*  **Insecure Cookie Attributes:** Cookies used to protect the session did not have appropriate `HttpOnly` and `SameSite` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Execute arbitrary Eclipse commands:** This could range from benign actions to potentially harmful ones.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could shut down the Eclipse application.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Actions like deleting text, overwriting files, or saving data in unexpected locations could lead to data corruption or loss.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  It could be possible to access sensitive data by executing commands that export or save data to a location accessible to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can embed a malicious `img` tag or use JavaScript on a web page to send GET requests to the vulnerable `livehelp` endpoint. This could be done on a page the user visits from within the Eclipse help browser, or via a malicious page visited in another browser.
*   **Malicious Email:** A malicious HTML email containing a remote image reference to the `livehelp` endpoint could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Local User:** Another user on the same system could exploit this vulnerability since local TCP/IP ports are often accessible without user-based security.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same machine as the target Eclipse instance.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the local help server's port. This could be from a webpage, email, or other application running on the same system.
*   **Knowledge of Port Number:** The attacker would need to discover the port number used by the help server, although a port scan can be used for this.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
* The vulnerability affects Eclipse Platform versions 4.18 and earlier, as well as older versions of the Eclipse Help System.
* The vulnerability is fixed by adding tokens to the help URL and using cookies to secure the session.
* A workaround for vulnerable versions of Eclipse is to disable active help via configuration.
* The fix involves adding checks for a valid session using tokens and cookies before executing commands via live help.
* Backports of the fix were made for several older versions of Eclipse.
* The vulnerability is not directly exploitable over the local network or the internet because the help server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) by default.
* The vulnerability can be triggered from a malicious web page that is viewed in an external or internal browser.
* The fix involves several Gerrit changes and backports, aiming to secure the session and prevent unauthorized command execution.
* The fix involved changes in the `HelpDisplay`, `BaseHelpSystem`, `index.jsp`, and `LiveHelpServlet` files.
