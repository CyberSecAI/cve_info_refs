# OWASP Dependency-Check

Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project’s dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

## Introduction

The OWASP Top 10 2013 contains a new entry: A9-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. Dependency Check can currently be used to scan applications (and their dependent libraries) to identify any known vulnerable components.

The problem with using known vulnerable components was described very well in a paper by Jeff Williams and Arshan Dabirsiaghi titled, “[Unfortunate Reality of Insecure Libraries](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/203759/file-1100864196-pdf/docs/Contrast_-_Insecure_Libraries_2014.pdf)”. The gist of the paper is that we as a development community include third party libraries in our applications that contain well known published vulnerabilities (such as those at the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)).

Dependency-check has a command line interface, a Maven plugin, an Ant task, and a Jenkins plugin. The core engine contains a series of analyzers that inspect the project dependencies, collect pieces of information about the dependencies (referred to as evidence within the tool). The evidence is then used to identify the [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) for the given dependency. If a CPE is identified, a listing of associated [Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) entries are listed in a report. Other 3rd party services and data sources such as the NPM Audit API, the OSS Index, RetireJS, and Bundler Audit are utilized for specific technologies.

Dependency-check automatically updates itself using the [NVD Data Feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) hosted by NIST. ‘'’IMPORTANT NOTE:’’’ The initial download of the data may take ten minutes or more. If you run the tool at least once every seven days, only a small JSON file needs to be downloaded to keep the local copy of the data current.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c0)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-12-21 05:47:59 EST  ``` I have found a possible security vulnerability in Eclipse, in the help component (Eclipse Project/Platform/User Assistance). I opened this bug in Community/Vulnerability Reports for visibility, but please move it if required.  I have found it is possible to run commands on the Eclipse application/system from an unauthenticated browser running on the same system. This could be a problem on multi-user systems as another user could close the Eclipse application, or bring up an export page or preferences page, which could be annoying.  The problem appears to be with the liveAction.js JavaScript calling the livehelp endpoint which allows the running of ILiveHelpAction actions or any Eclipse command.  For Eclipse applications using ILiveHelpAction in their HTML help pages <a class="xref" href="javascript:liveAction(%22org.eclipse.MyPlugin.ui%22,%22org.eclipse.MyPlugin.ui.SampleAction%22,%22sampleargs%22)" shape="rect">click here</a>  A general Eclipse applications using live help inside the help HTML has code like: <a class="xref" shape="rect" href="javascript:executeCommand(&quot;org.eclipse.ui.file.exit())&quot;)">click here</a>  These call methods in [https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/+/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.help/livehelp.js](https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/%2B/refs/heads/master/org.eclipse.help/livehelp.js) which has this line: url=url+"livehelp/?pluginID="+pluginId+"&class="+className+"&arg="+encodedArg+"&nocaching="+Math.random();  so issuing a get to <http://127.0.0.1:49834/help/livehelp/?pluginID=org.eclipse.help.ui&class=org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.ExecuteCommandAction&arg=org.eclipse.ui.file.exit()&nocaching=123> can shut down the Eclipse application. (Modify the port number to the current port number of the help system, easily found by a port scan.)  <https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ua/blob/master/org.eclipse.help.webapp/plugin.xml> shows livehelp goes to <https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ua/blob/master/org.eclipse.help.webapp/src/org/eclipse/help/internal/webapp/servlet/LiveHelpServlet.java> which calls BaseHelpSystem.runLiveHelp(pluginID, className, arg); <https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ua/blob/6fa77889b2d1ce2d8f07b2b4a5d576fb4db6cb11/org.eclipse.help.base/src/org/eclipse/help/internal/base/BaseHelpSystem.java#L316>  There is [bug 223539](show_bug.cgi?id=223539 "CLOSED WONTFIX - [Webapp][Security] Vulnerability discovered in Eclipse.") but that is not the same. [The topic behaviour is still there, which allows queries like: <http://127.0.0.1:52054/help/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.ui/plugin.xml> which then allows a quick way to find all the commands that might be issued by livehelp to the plugin.]  There is [bug 569560](show_bug.cgi?id=569560 "NEW - Integrated web server should only listen on localhost") Integrated web server should only listen on localhost. Actually, I think it does only listen on 127.0.0.1 which is good as then this bug is not directly exploitable over the local network or the Internet.  The bug is exploitable though by browsing a malicious webpage which uses a img element referring to the livehelp endpoint. Often, but not always, the help server runs on a random port, which slows down an attack. A malicious HTML email containing a remote image reference to the livehelp endpoint might also be a vector.  The bug is also exploitable by another local user as normally there is no user-based security on local TCP/IP ports.  There are variety of Eclipse commands which could cause problems - for example select all, cut, delete, save, save all, exit which might cause denial of service (if the application is shut down) or data corruption (if text is deleted in a text editor). It might be possible to issue commands to overwrite files in the system, or to save data in a place accessible to another user on the system. Commands with command parameters are particularly interesting.  It may be possible to disable live help using a plugin customization org.eclipse.help.base/activeHelp=false but I don't have a working example yet of how to do that.  If help is not started then the attack doesn't work, but closing the help browser after opening it does not prevent the attack.  Removing the livehelp.js file will not prevent the attack.  Removing org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.ExecuteCommandAction prevents the issue of Eclipse commands from live help but still leaves ILiveHelpAction classes which could also do bad things if invoked maliciously.  The livehelp endpoint should be a POST rather than a GET because the live help action could change the state of the system.  Ideally the livehelp endpoint would use a session cookie so that only a web browser launched by the help system could launch live help in that Eclipse application. That might not stop a user from going to a malicious webpage from inside the help browser though so we would need to consider cross-site scripting. There is then the question of whether the cookie can be intercepted but a the data just goes through the loopback interface this might not be a big risk. Using https for Eclipse local help seems hard work. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c1)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 06:35:14 EST  ``` Any updates on this? It would be nice to have this fixed for 2021-03. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c2)  Wim Jongman [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 07:23:32 EST  ``` (In reply to Andrew Johnson from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c0))  Thanks for this Andrew. Does this also affect people running the live help as an infocenter like we have here:  <https://remainsoftware.com/docs/openapi/help/index.jsp> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c3)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 07:56:59 EST  ``` Re: [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c2). That should be safe.  Calling the live help endpoint at: <https://remainsoftware.com/docs/openapi/help/index.jsp>  gives a ServletException because BaseHelpSystem.getMode() == BaseHelpSystem.MODE_INFOCENTER  <https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ua/blob/02a1a93aa74af33e4b7b9ca8df6db03eb9de4736/org.eclipse.help.webapp/src/org/eclipse/help/internal/webapp/servlet/LiveHelpServlet.java#L36>  Though we should consider modes: BaseHelpSystem.MODE_STANDALONE BaseHelpSystem.MODE_WORKBENCH  The exception backtrace displayed from ServletException from the info center is like this: HTTP ERROR 500 javax.servlet.ServletException URI:	/help/livehelp/ STATUS:	500 MESSAGE:	javax.servlet.ServletException SERVLET:	org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty.internal.HttpServerManager$InternalHttpServiceServlet-52759574 CAUSED BY:	javax.servlet.ServletException Caused by:  javax.servlet.ServletException 	at org.eclipse.help.internal.webapp.servlet.LiveHelpServlet.init(LiveHelpServlet.java:36) 	at javax.servlet.GenericServlet.init(GenericServlet.java:244) 	at org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry.internal.ServletManager$ServletWrapper.initializeDelegate(ServletManager.java:198) ...  While this is potentially useful to developers, it does give a little bit more information to an attacker. This would be a different problem though. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c4)  Wim Jongman [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 09:28:53 EST  ``` (In reply to Andrew Johnson from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c3)) > Re: [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c2). That should be safe.  Thanks, Andrew. I am impressed, and I'm glad you are on *our* team. :)  Is it possible for you to provide a patch? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c5)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 10:09:04 EST  ``` A simple way to disable live help is to have the line  org.eclipse.help.base/activeHelp=false  in the plugin_customization.ini, or start Eclipse with the option -pluginCustomization=pc.ini  where pc.ini contains the configuration that you want.  To properly fix the problem could be done if live help could check the session ID compared to the session ID of when the internal or external help browser was started. That could be a bit hard to find out in a secure fashion - so perhaps the internal/external help browser needs to be started referring to an end point with a couple of query parameters - the required starting help page and a securely generated non-guessable session id. The session ID is stored to be accessible by the livehelp servlet by the code starting the browser. The browser then makes a request to the endpoint which sets a (HttpOnly? SecureSite?) cookie value with the supplied session ID to be returned to the browser, and returns with a redirect to the required web page. When a webpage with livehelp is reached then the livehelp JavaScript accesses the livehelp endpoint, and the livehelp session cookie is passed across by the browser. The livehelp plugin then checks the incoming session cookie against the stored value.   We need to be aware of attacks where the user in the proper help browser goes to a malicious web page which attempts to get the livehelp session cookie - or just access the endpoint and the browser supplies the cookie. Beware session hijacking and cross-site request forgery. I don't think we can insist on https but for local access that shouldn't be a problem - if someone has OS privileges to sniff loopback then he or she probably has administrator access already.  This gets a bit beyond my experience level - and the help starting code then gets a dependency on how the livehelp code works, so really needs help from the user assistance team. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c6)  Wim Jongman [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-13 10:38:31 EST  ``` Adding Holger for comments. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c7)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-14 16:18:08 EST  ``` If the team believes that this vulnerability is significant and needs to be disclosed to adopters, then we should issue a CVE.

As far as I know, this is only possible via the URL and I do not know how to do this ("...;jsessionid=..." does not override an existing "JSESSIONID" cookie; and then how to redirect to remove the session ID from the URL again?). But I have neither experience nor knowledge here.  By the way, the following property can be used to specify a fixed port: -Dserver_port=<port_number> ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c12)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-11 16:49:45 EST  ``` I think this is better, but there may still be a race condition. Can a malicious application running on the same machine, or a web page in another browser, make continual requests to the prospective help web server port and make the first request before the real browser makes its first request?  Does this idea cope with the user closing then reopening the external or internal web browser, or switching preferences between them, or does live help stop working until Eclipse is restarted.  Does this protect against cross-site request forgery? If the user in the help browser goes to a malicious external web page, can that page make a request with a valid session ID?  I'll see if I can get a prototype to work as with [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c5) as an alternate approach and we can compare. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c13)  Holger Voormann [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-12 04:32:45 EST  ``` (In reply to Andrew Johnson from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c12)) Thanks for the reply.  Yes, also with this change there would be a vulnerability by continual requests or by cross-site request forgery.  The question is, how can this be fixed? Is there a secure way to open a URL and then be sure that subsequent HTTP requests come from the same browser, not triggered via cross-site forgery? Is there a best practice that could be followed here?  The help web server is started when the "Help" view or the help browser ("Help > Help Contents") is opened for the first time. It continues running even if the help view and help browser are closed.  The only idea I have (not being a web developer), is to add a token (e.g. UUID.randomUUID().toString()) to the URL (e.g. as URI path segment parameter) to open the help browser. For example something like: 127.0.0.1:55055/help/index.jsp;7a2e6231-fd9f-4ec5-ad9a-1681792c3b11?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-02a.htm And the JavaScript of the livehelp reads the token from the path or from a cookie where it has been stored and creates an HTTP request URL containing that token as URI path segment parameter:  <http://127.0.0.1:55055/help/livehelp;7a2e6231-fd9f-4ec5-ad9a-1681792c3b11>?... or as query parameter: <http://127.0.0.1:55055/help/livehelp?...&token=7a2e6231-fd9f-4ec5-ad9a-1681792c3b11> Would that be safe? ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c14)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-12 10:56:38 EST  ``` I've got something now based on [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c5) and [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c13).  With a help request to the local machine, HelpDisplay generates a secure random token, stores it in BaseHelpSystem and appends it to the help URL as &token=<UUID>  On the server, index.jsp checks the token matches BaseHelpSystem. If so, it generates another secure token and stores it in a per port cookie XSESSION-nnnn and also stores the value in a session attribute XSESSION  livehelp_js.jsp is updated by the server to rewrite the page to append a &token=<UUID> from the token parameter on each live help request. I think this is needed rather than relying on the token parameter later when it is called as the individual frames might not have the token.  LiveHelpServlet checks   the JSESSIONID cookie against the session id  the XSESSION-nnnn cookie against the session attribute XSESSION  the token parameter against the BaseHelpSystem value  A request from another browser on the local machine fails with HTTP ERROR 403 JSESSIONID as there is no JSESSIONID cookie  This cookie is marked as HttpOnly:false and SameSite:"None" so might be accessed by other malicious webpages from the same browser.  XSESSION-nnnn is HttpOnly:true and SameSite:"Strict" which should stop external web pages  I'm not sure about malicious web pages served by another webserver (e.g. another Eclipse) on localhost - the cookies would be sent, but the token query parameter might protect against that.  Is it okay to put this on Gerrit - or is that too public? If it works then we should have some tests too.  I'd also appreciate a web app developer review of this idea. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c15)  Holger Voormann [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-14 10:07:12 EST  ``` (In reply to Andrew Johnson from [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c14)) @Andrew That sounds great!  @Wayne Could you please tell us how to proceed?

With a help request to the local machine, HelpDisplay generates a secure random token, stores it  in BaseHelpSystem and appends it to the help URL as &token=<UUID>  On the server, index.jsp checks the query token matches the token stored in BaseHelpSystem. If so, it generates another secure token and stores it in a per port cookie XSESSION-nnnn and also stores the value in a session attribute XSESSION It generates another secure token and stores it in a session attribute LSESSION The token in BaseHelpSystem is removed so this logon only works once. The token query parameter is removed from the redirect URL as it is not needed any more.  livehelp_js.jsp is updated by the server to rewrite the page to append a &token=<UUID>  from the session attribute LSESSION. I think this is needed rather than relying on the token parameter later when it is called as the individual frames might not have the token.  LiveHelpServlet checks   the JSESSIONID cookie against the session id  the XSESSION-nnnn cookie against the session attribute XSESSION  the token parameter against the session attribute LSESSION   The JSESSIONID check protects against one-off live help GET request coming from somewhere on the local machine. It's not a secure check as it the cookie doesn't have the right HttpOnly SameSite attributes.  The XSESSION-nnn cookie protects against another browser making  a valid live help request. There might be a way in the same browser of making a request, but it would have to come from the same site. It's a bit tricky, but could an attacker on the same machine, but different user account persuade the user in the help browser to click  on a web page served on a different port on 127.0.0.1  This could either directly make a live help request, or the  XSESSION-nnn cookie would be sent to the attacker's local server for use later.  The session attribute LSESSION helps protect against the above. This is also only in the page from the valid session which has included livehelp_js.jsp which has been updated by the server with a query parameter. Does this protect against a local attacker who can get the user's browser to request this page again? Does this need to be generated one time only? It would break livehelp if the help is reloaded?  Also the new help uses livehelp.js so this change could stop live help working with new help. ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c19)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-16 08:06:44 EST  ``` Should I submit my suggested changes to Gerrit? ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c20)  Holger Voormann [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-16 09:46:59 EST  ``` (In reply to Andrew Johnson from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c16) and #18) > Created [attachment 285548](attachment.cgi?id=285548&action=diff "Prototype patch for securing live help") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=285548&action=edit "Prototype patch for securing live help") > Prototype patch for securing live help >  Thanks Andrew!  The patch looks good to me. To my understanding, knowledge and testing, it is also save against cross-site attacks. Could you please provide it as Gerrit change?  Here are my comments:  (1) HelpDisplay Since the help URL might not have parameters (e.g. "Help > Help Contents"), the line 	helpURL += "&token=" + sessid; //$NON-NLS-1$ should be 	helpURL += (helpURL.indexOf('?') < 0 ? '?' : '&') + "token=" + sessid; //$NON-NLS-1$  (2) BaseHelpSystem Instead of getter/setter I would prefer push/pop for the one-time token: 	public void pushLiveHelpToken(String helpSessionId) { 		this.liveHelpToken = helpSessionId; 	}  	public String popLiveHelpToken() { 		String oneTimeToken = liveHelpToken; 		liveHelpToken = null; 		return oneTimeToken; 	}  (3) index.jsp  (3a) The new code should be moved down some lines into the "else" branch of "if(data.isBot())" since it is not required for web crawlers.  (3b) With (2) and to discard the one-time token in all cases where the page is requested with the "token" parameter, it can be simplified to:         // Live help token, to make sure that only the help opened by the application can execute commands 		String token = request.getParameter("token"); //$NON-NLS-1$ 		if (token != null && token.equals(BaseHelpSystem.getInstance().popLiveHelpToken()) 				&& request.getSession().getAttribute("XSESSION") == null) { //$NON-NLS-1$ 			String token2 = UUID.randomUUID().toString(); 			request.getSession().setAttribute("XSESSION", token2); //$NON-NLS-1$ 			int port = request.getLocalPort(); 			response.addHeader("Set-Cookie", "XSESSION-" + port + "=" + token2 + "; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict"); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$ //$NON-NLS-3$ //$NON-NLS-4$ 			String token3 = UUID.randomUUID().toString(); 			request.getSession().setAttribute("LSESSION", token3); //$NON-NLS-1$ 		}  (4) LiveHelpServlet.java In the new/modernized help UI prototype, livehelp does not work yet, because the livehelp JavaScript is bound to the HTML 4 frameset structure of the legacy UI. But as soon this is fixed, it should work the same way. So please, remove the experimental UI check, by replacing 		// @FIXME - is this needed for the new UI 		String experimentalUi = System.getProperty("org.eclipse.help.webapp.experimental.ui"); //$NON-NLS-1$ 		if (!lsessOK && experimentalUi == null) { with: 		if (!lsessOK) {  (5) 2x MANIFEST.MF The version number of "org.eclipse.help.base" has to be increased and in "org.eclipse.help.webapp" the version range of this dependency adapted accordingly. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c21)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-16 15:57:42 EST  ``` New Gerrit change created: [https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/+/176366](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/%2B/176366) ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c22)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-16 16:41:11 EST  ``` New Gerrit change created: [https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/+/176367](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/%2B/176367) ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c23)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-17 05:28:33 EST  ``` I've seen the approval in Gerrit. Here are my responses to from [comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c20)  1. Done 2. push/pop not done as could lead to a denial of service if a supplied token was wrong - instead the matchOnceLiveHelpToken method clears the stored token if successful. We could store a hash and use a constant time check to be safer. 3. Code moved down - I left the regex check to avoid garbage data getting further into the system before being rejected. 4. Done 5. Done - the method addition would normally increment the minor version, but as they are internal packages and method just used by friend plugins no one externally should be relying on this, so I just made it a fix level change.  I have not made the following changes, which would be nice to have but not essential:  1. store and compare hashes in BaseHelpSystem 2. Return 400 (or 422) for live help where the bundle or class name is wrong. 3. Use and enforce POST not GET for live help  They can be done later if required. ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c24)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-22 07:24:00 EST  ``` Gerrit change [https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/+/176367](https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ua/%2B/176367) was merged to [master].

[I get a cheat sheet not found message inside Eclipse, but that is a problem with the missing CVS cheat sheet].  Copying the page link to another browser (Chrome) and clicking on the link gives a "HTTP ERROR 403 token". I don't see any way of driving a valid live help request from another browser.  Trying to access a live help URL link directly from another page loaded from a file URL in the same browser gives a similar 403 error.  Adding the token query from the live help JavaScript to the above link gives a "HTTP ERROR 403 XSESSION-62017"  Copying the help page link to another tab in the same browser (Firefox) and clicking on the example cheat sheet link does work but I think that is in the same browser session. I can't see how though a page loaded from elsewhere in the same browser could read the live help JavaScript from the help server and drive a valid request - but perhaps someone else could check this.

The token is not used in the Infocenter where shorter URLs are nicer for sharing them. In contrast, the token is only visible to the user in the Eclipse IDE when an external browser instead of the help browser is used (e.g. for "Help > Help Contents", in the preferences "Help" the option "Open help contents" have to be set to "In an external browser") where sharing of URLs does not make sense.  And it does not affect security since it's a one-time token.  Thanks for reporting and fixing this vulnerability, Andrew! Great job. Thanks also to Lakshmi for approving the fix in time for 4.19. ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c30)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-24 11:52:24 EST  ``` The committer-only flag needs to be turned off.

Choose one of these:   A. When building the RCP application, in the product plugin_customization.ini add the lines:  # Disable active help org.eclipse.help.base/activeHelp=false  B. or possibly if the product is installed with an unpacked plug-in jars, modify plugin_customization.ini as above   C. 1. create a file pc.ini containing the lines # Disable active help org.eclipse.help.base/activeHelp=false    2. then start eclipse including command line options -pluginCustomization pc.ini  D. 1. create a file pc.ini containing the lines # Disable active help org.eclipse.help.base/activeHelp=false    2. modify the application startup options file (for example eclipse.ini) to include the lines (before any -vmargs line): -pluginCustomization <change this to the full path to>/pc.ini   Test that active help has been disabled by launching help from the Eclipse application, then click on an active help link in the existing help. If the existing help does not have an active help link that does not mean that the installation is safe. It may be possible to check by adding some help with an active help link.  For example: Window > Preferences > Help > Content Add new information center <http://help.eclipse.org/2020-12/>  Then start the help and go to: Workbench User Guide Reference Preferences  Click on the 'Use the Preferences dialog pages' link.  See if a preference page comes up - if so then active help has not been disabled.  If active help has been disabled then this message appears: "Active help is not enabled in your installation." ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c35)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-02-26 17:03:20 EST  ``` I've assigned CVE-2020-27225 (Don't use this until after we push the report)  (In reply to Lakshmi P Shanmugam from [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c32)) > Should we also mention the product as Eclipse SDK?

Please create new bug for investigation. This was delivered in 4.19 and shouldn't be used to track any possible new patches in 4.20 or other releases.  Beside this, the crash seem to be GTK related and the patch doesn't look like touching any GTK related code. I would rather assume the concrete SDK patch build was done on wrong environment and that again would speak for a different bug. ```  [Comment 57](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c57)  Kit Lo [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-04-12 15:24:56 EDT  ``` Sure!

When checking the product (WAR file) using the OWASP dependency check command line tool in version 6.2.2 (<https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/>) the report still shows vulnerabilites related to CVE-2020-27225, e.g., for org.eclipse.equinox.http.servlet_1.7.0.v20210202-1229.jar (cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:platform:1.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*, pkg:maven/org.eclipse.platform/org.eclipse.equinox.http.servlet@1.7.0). However, since the related platform plugins have been upgraded along with RAP, I expected that the report would not show any vulnerabilites related to CVE-2020-27225. In order to make this CVE disappear, it must be explicitly suppressed. An upgrade alone is not sufficcient.  Can you give me any advice on how to handle this without suppressing the CVE? Maybe it would be better to assign the CVE only to the affected components (plugins). ```  [Comment 82](show_bug.cgi?id=569855#c82)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-06-22 04:44:10 EDT  ``` I don't know the right way to fix this but I note the following.  If I run <https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck> on Eclipse Memory Analyzer, it reports rows such as  org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans_1.7.200.v20210111-0759.jar	cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:platform:1.7.200:*:*:*:*:*:*:*	pkg:maven/org.eclipse.platform/org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans@1.7.200	HIGH	1	Highest	45  org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench3_0.15.500.v20201021-1339.jar	cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:platform:0.15.500:*:*:*:*:*:*:*	pkg:maven/org.eclipse.platform/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench3@0.15.500	HIGH	1	Highest	40  so it seems to map every Eclipse plugin version to the Eclipse platform of the same version number. That's not right as all sorts of plugins make up the Eclipse Platform, and results in lots of warnings about this CVE. The problem has been reported as an issue: <https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/3255>    Dependency Check uses <https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe> "Official Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) Dictionary  CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. Based upon the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI), CPE includes a formal name format, a method for checking names against a system, and a description format for binding text and tests to a name."  So somehow there should be a better mapping of plugin and versions to the Eclipse platform. Also, perhaps this should have been reported as a CVE against the Eclipse Help subsytem as that might be a separately upgradable item, but I think even this is going to have problems. So for Memory Analyzer 1.12 features include:  Eclipse.org	Eclipse RCP	4.20.0.v20210611-1600	org.eclipse.rcp Eclipse.org	Help System Base	2.3.600.v20210611-1600	org.eclipse.help Eclipse Memory Analyzer	Memory Analyzer RCP	1.12.0.202106190923	org.eclipse.mat.ui.rcp.feature Eclipse Modeling Project	EMF Common	2.22.0.v20210319-0732	org.eclipse.emf.common Eclipse Modeling Project	EMF Ecore	2.24.0.v20210405-0628	org.eclipse.emf.ecore  but the help plugins are:  	Eclipse.org	Help System Base	4.3.300.v20210611-1600	org.eclipse.help.base 	Eclipse.org	Help System Core	3.9.0.v20210507-0822	org.eclipse.help 	Eclipse.org	Help System UI	4.3.0.v20210409-1726	org.eclipse.help.ui 	Eclipse.org	Help System Webapp	3.10.300.v20210507-0822	org.eclipse.help.webapp  However in the CPE database are only the following for "eclipse help".   Vendor Product Version Update Edition Language cpe:2.3:a:ibm:eclipse_help_system:3.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:* ibm eclipse_help_system 3.4.3  cpe:2.3:a:ibm:eclipse_help_system:3.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:* ibm eclipse_help_system 3.6.2   and clicking on the associated CVEs (nothing to do with this bug, but for illustration: CVE 2013 0464 "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in IBM Eclipse Help System (IEHS) 3.4.3 and 3.6.2, as used in IBM SPSS Data Collection 6.0, 6.0.1, and 7.0, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted URL." so the CPE versions above seem to be the Eclipse Platform versions. ``` |  |
