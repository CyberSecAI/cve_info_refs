Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**CVE-2020-27665** relates to missing permission checks in the Content-Type Builder (CTB) routes of Strapi.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper permission checks on the Content-Type Builder (CTB) routes. This means that users without the necessary permissions could potentially access and manipulate CTB functionalities.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Missing authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of authorization checks on the CTB routes. This allows unauthorized access to potentially sensitive functionalities.
    *   **Inadequate access control:** There is inadequate access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized modifications through CTB routes.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with admin panel access, but lacking the specific permissions for CTB, could potentially exploit this by accessing and manipulating CTB routes and performing unauthorized actions, such as creating, modifying, or deleting content types, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation of the application's structure.
    *   It is noted that this is only exploitable by a user with admin panel access.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through direct interaction with the CTB routes.
    *   An attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to attempt exploitation.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the Strapi admin panel.
    *   The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with some admin panel access, but who is lacking the correct permission to access CTB routes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was implemented in pull request [#8439](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/pull/8439) and included in the Strapi v3.2.5 release.
*   The provided content also details other security fixes included in the v3.2.5 release, specifically for XSS in the WYSIWYG preview and a removal of an unsecure proxy usage.
