Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-27758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `ReadTXTImage()` function within the `coders/txt.c` file of ImageMagick.
- Improper handling of maximum constraints during pixel value computation can result in values falling outside the representable range of the `unsigned long long` data type.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Undefined behavior due to out-of-range values for `unsigned long long` type.
- Integer overflow due to missing or incorrect max constraints when calculating pixel values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application availability is likely to be impacted, potentially leading to a crash.
- Other unspecified issues related to undefined behavior may also arise due to the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input files to ImageMagick.
- Processing this crafted input with the vulnerable `ReadTXTImage()` can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted input file for processing by ImageMagick.
- No specific position or privileges are mentioned, but the attacker needs to interact with a system running a vulnerable version of ImageMagick.

**Additional details:**

- The issue was addressed in ImageMagick version 7.0.8-68.
- Red Hat considers the severity of this vulnerability to be low due to the lack of a specific demonstrated impact beyond potential application unavailability.
- The vulnerability is out of scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 and Inkscape is not affected on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because it no longer bundles ImageMagick.
