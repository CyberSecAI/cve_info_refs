Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-27763:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error within the `MagickCore/resize.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Division by Zero:** The core issue is a mathematical division by zero. This occurs in the resize function, which does not properly handle certain input parameters which results in a zero divisor.
- **Undefined Behavior:**  The division-by-zero results in undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the division by zero causes the application to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Potential for other issues:** The undefined behavior could potentially lead to further unpredictable consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, will trigger the vulnerable code path within the resize function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit or have ImageMagick process a crafted image file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.8-68
- The vulnerability is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.
- Inkscape is not affected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
