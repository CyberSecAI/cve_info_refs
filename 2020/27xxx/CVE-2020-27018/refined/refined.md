Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a script accessible via the appliance's web server. This script can be manipulated to request arbitrary URLs, including local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The script allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
- Local File Disclosure: By using "file://" URLs, an authenticated attacker can access parts of local files on the server. The application only returns content following "\r\n\r\n", limiting the scope of the file disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can potentially access sensitive information from local files on the server.
- An attacker can make requests to other internal systems or external URLs using the server as a proxy, which can have further consequences depending on the network configuration.
- The severity is rated as low, due to the need for authentication and the partial nature of the file disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the IMSVA web interface.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the target URL (e.g. a local file, or an internal server) and sends it to the vulnerable proxy_controller.php script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security Virtual Appliance.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the appliance's web interface.
