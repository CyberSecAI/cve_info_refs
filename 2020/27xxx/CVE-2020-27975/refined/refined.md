Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-27975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the OScommerce Phoenix CE application, specifically in the backend. Critical functions are performed from the shop backend without proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF mechanisms to validate requests, making the application susceptible to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to force an authenticated user to perform unintended actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of exploitation ranges from modifying PHP code to potentially achieving remote code execution. As demonstrated in the provided PoC, attackers can modify files and view system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves creating a malicious HTML page containing a crafted request that targets vulnerable functions within the OScommerce backend. An authenticated backend user would be tricked into visiting this malicious page and unknowingly trigger unwanted actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to host a web page or otherwise entice a currently authenticated backend user to visit the malicious page. They do not need direct access to the OScommerce Phoenix CE application. The user must have an active, authenticated session with the application.
