Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `oc image extract` command within the `openshift-clients` package. The command is susceptible to a "zip slip" vulnerability when extracting a specially crafted container image (.tar file).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Handling:** The vulnerability lies in how `oc image extract` handles symbolic links within a tar archive. It improperly validates the paths of symbolic links, allowing for links pointing outside the intended extraction directory.
- **Path Traversal:** The ability to create symbolic links pointing outside the intended extraction directory makes the system vulnerable to path traversal attacks, enabling writing to locations outside the expected directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By crafting a malicious container image with specific symbolic links, an attacker can overwrite existing files outside the target directory when the image is extracted with `oc image extract`.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If an attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files, it allows for arbitrary code execution on the system where the `oc` command is being used.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The vulnerability poses a significant threat to system confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to the potential for data manipulation and code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Container Image:** The primary attack vector is the delivery of a crafted container image containing malicious symbolic links.
- **`oc image extract` Command:** Exploitation is triggered when the vulnerable `oc image extract` command is used to extract the crafted image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Container Image:** Attackers need to be able to create a container image (.tar file) with specially crafted symbolic links to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Access to `oc` Tool:** The attacker needs to have access to a system where the `oc` command is available and used.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to extract the crafted container image using the vulnerable command.
- **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "zip slip" type vulnerability, where attackers use symbolic links to escape the intended extraction directory.
- A mitigation for this is to use the `--only-files=true` option with `oc image extract`.
- This forces extraction of files/directories and ignores symbolic links, preventing malicious path traversal, albeit also preventing legitimate symbolic link extraction.
- The vulnerability was found in all versions of the `oc` binary within the `openshift-clients` package.
- The bug was closed with a status of WONTFIX
