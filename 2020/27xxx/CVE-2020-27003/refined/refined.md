**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files. Specifically, a value obtained from the file is used as a pointer without prior validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Untrusted pointer dereference.
- Improper validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a malicious TIFF file.
- Visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious TIFF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF file or a malicious page with a crafted TIFF file.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
