Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27838:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The client registration endpoint in Keycloak allows fetching information about PUBLIC clients without authentication. This is problematic because it exposes sensitive information, such as client secrets, even if the client is initially registered as public.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Access Control:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control on the client registration endpoint. It does not verify the client's public/confidential status before allowing access to information, specifically client secrets.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to fetch client information (including secrets) without authentication leads to potential information disclosure.
*   **Privilege Escalation Risk:** If a client is initially created as `PUBLIC` and later changed to `CONFIDENTIAL`, the previous lack of access control on the public client allows information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality Breach:**  The primary threat is to data confidentiality. Attackers can potentially obtain sensitive client secrets, allowing them to impersonate or misuse the application that the client represents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the Keycloak client registration API, accessible through network requests.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making unauthenticated requests to the client registration endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Keycloak instance.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Keycloak:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the Keycloak client registration API works to craft the requests necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Keycloak version 13.0.0 and RHSSO 7.5.0.
*   The vulnerability is related to the KEYCLOAK-16612 JIRA issue.
*   The bug report also references KEYCLOAK-16521.
