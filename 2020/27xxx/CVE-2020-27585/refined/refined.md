**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing restriction on password attempts for the settings password field within Quick Heal Total Security. This allows for brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of any rate limiting or lockout mechanism on the password input field for the application's settings.
- This lack of protection against brute-force attempts makes the password easily guessable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can successfully brute-force the settings password, granting them access to modify sensitive antivirus settings.
-  The attacker could disable critical security features, such as:
   - DNA scan
   - Anti-keylogger
   - Automatic updates

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local admin rights.
- The attacker needs to access the settings functionality of the Quick Heal Total Security application.
- Once within the settings, the attacker can repeatedly attempt passwords to brute-force the settings password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local administrator rights on the target system.
- The attacker needs to have access to the Quick Heal Total Security application settings.
