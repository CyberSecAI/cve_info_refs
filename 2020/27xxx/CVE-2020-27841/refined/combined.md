# OpenJPEG: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202101-29**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenJPEG, the worst of
which could result in the arbitrary execution of code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/openjpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.4.0**< **1.5.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.4.0** |

### Background

OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJPEG. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenJPEG 2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/openjpeg-2.4.0:2"

```

Gentoo has discontinued support OpenJPEG 1.x and any dependent packages
should now be using OpenJPEG 2 or have dropped support for the library.
We recommend that users unmerge OpenJPEG 1.x:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "media-libs/openjpeg:1"

```
