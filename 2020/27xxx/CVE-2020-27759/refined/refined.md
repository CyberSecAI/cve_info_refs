Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-27759:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper type conversion in the `IntensityCompare()` function within the `/MagickCore/quantize.c` file of ImageMagick. A `double` value was being cast to an `int` and returned. This could result in a value outside the valid range of an `int` being returned.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer overflow/Out-of-range value:** The core issue is an out-of-range value during the cast from double to int within the `IntensityCompare()` function. This happens because the double's value could be larger than the max or smaller than the min values of an int, resulting in an invalid return value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact, according to Red Hat, is a potential loss of application availability. This means the vulnerability could lead to a crash or other undefined behaviour that prevents the application from working as intended.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted image file using ImageMagick. The specific conditions that would trigger the flaw are not elaborated, however, it is triggered when the result of IntensityCompare would be out of int bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted image file to an application using ImageMagick. This suggests that the vulnerability could be triggered in a scenario where user-supplied images are processed by ImageMagick.

**Additional details:**
- The bug report from Red Hat Bugzilla mentions the upstream fix was a commit (d44f8a35558951a21367d306a42e5a097f3a43fe) on the ImageMagick GitHub repository. The fix was in ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.
- Red Hat has assigned a "low" severity to this issue because they could not demonstrate a specific impact beyond a potential loss of application availability.
- The issue is present in multiple versions of ImageMagick
