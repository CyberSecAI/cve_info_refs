The content is related to CVE-2020-27231.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `findDistrict` parameter of the `patientslist.do` page, which is then used in the construction of a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the `findDistrict` parameter is directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the vulnerable parameter. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification or deletion of data, or potential full control of the database server. The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, with no impact on availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to the `patientslist.do` page, by crafting malicious SQL code in the `findDistrict` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
