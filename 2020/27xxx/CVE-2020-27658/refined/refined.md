Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-27658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Synology SRM web interface sets a session cookie ("id") upon successful login, but this cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing HttpOnly flag:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie. This allows JavaScript to access the cookie.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to potential information disclosure because a malicious script can access the session cookie.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal the "id" session cookie by injecting arbitrary JavaScript into a page.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The stolen cookie can be used to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the Synology SRM management interface, potentially with administrator privileges.
*   **Compromise of System:** Full control of the router and network could be achieved by an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers must inject malicious JavaScript into a web page that interacts with the Synology SRM web interface. This can be achieved through another vulnerability, for example, as demonstrated in TALOS-2020-1087.
*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, targeting the web interface of the Synology SRM.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into a context where it will execute when a user interacts with the Synology SRM web interface. This could be through a separate vulnerability, such as reflected or stored XSS.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the Synology SRM web interface.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on a user interacting with the injected script, which makes this a UI-dependent vulnerability.
