Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `getAssets.jsp` page of OpenClinic GA 5.173.3. Specifically, the `componentStatus` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable `componentStatus` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    -  Read sensitive database information.
    -  Modify or delete database records.
    -  Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    -  Compromise data integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `getAssets.jsp` page. The malicious SQL code is inserted within the `componentStatus` parameter of this request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without any authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter `componentStatus` is used in the following SQL query:
```sql
" AND EXISTS (select * from OC_ASSETCOMPONENTS where OC_COMPONENT_ASSETUID=OC_ASSET_SERVERID||'.'||OC_ASSET_OBJECTID and OC_COMPONENT_NOMENCLATURE like '" + (ScreenHelper.checkString(findItem.comment15).length() == 0 ? "%" : findItem.comment15) + "' and OC_COMPONENT_STATUS='" + findItem.comment16 + "')"
```
- As can be seen above the application uses  `findItem.comment16` which is derived from the `componentStatus` parameter and concatenates it directly into the SQL query, without sanitization.
