Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27509

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of server-side sanitization of the 'subject' variable in the HTTP POST request when sending an email. This allows an attacker to inject a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The injected payload is stored and executed when the recipient views the email.
*   **Lack of HttpOnly flag on session cookie:** The session cookie doesn't have the HttpOnly flag set, allowing JavaScript to access it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full Account Takeover:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability and the missing HttpOnly flag, an attacker can steal session cookies, leading to full account takeover.
*   **Unauthorized access to emails:** Once the attacker has control of the account, they can potentially read, modify, or delete emails and other data in the mailbox.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker manipulates the HTTP POST request when sending an email. Specifically, by inserting a malicious script into the 'subject' field.
*   The recipient is then tricked into executing the payload by simply logging in and viewing the crafted email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable Galaxkey platform.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send emails within the Galaxkey platform.
*   The attacker does not need to directly interact with the victim to initiate the exploit, the victim only needs to receive and open the malicious email.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable versions are Galaxkey v5.6.11.4 and v5.6.11.5.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed by Galaxkey.
