SSA-705111: Multiple Vulnerabilities (NAME:WRECK) in the DNS Module of Nucleus RTOS

| Publication Date: | 2021-04-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2022-01-11 |
| Current Version: | V1.2 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 6.5 |

SUMMARY

Security researchers discovered and disclosed 9 vulnerabilities in several DNS implementations, also known as “NAME:WRECK” vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities described in this advisory are from this set.

The DNS client of affected products contains multiple vulnerabilities related to the handling of DNS responses and requests. The most severe could allow an attacker to manipulate the DNS responses and cause a denial-of-service condition.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Avoid using DNS client of affected versions

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Capital VSTAR is an efficient implementation of the AUTOSAR standard. It is a complete solution including tools and a software platform to meet engineers’ needs, from creating ECU extract updates to software platform configurations.
Although not based on Nucleus RTOS, VSTAR includes its networking module, Nucleus NET.

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking and communication protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured network support in any embedded device. The networking functionality is fully integrated into the Nucleus RTOS and supports a variety of processors and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services ideal for applications where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for scalability and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications. Since V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart platform.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) ([https://www.first.org/cvss](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed
list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found
at: <https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27736

The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the null-terminated name in DNS-responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the read memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27737

The DNS response parsing functionality does not properly validate various length and counts of the records. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition or leak the memory past the allocated structure.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27738

The DNS domain name record decompression functionality does not properly validate the pointer offset values. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a read access past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition.

[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Nucleus NET module incorporates a wide range of standard-compliant networking
and communication protocols, drivers, and utilities to deliver full-featured
network support in any embedded device. The networking functionality is fully
integrated into the Nucleus RTOS and supports a variety of processors and MCUs.

Nucleus ReadyStart is a platform with integrated software IP, tools, and services
ideal for applications where a small footprint, deterministic performance, and small code size are essential.

Nucleus RTOS is a highly scalable micro-kernel based real-time operating system designed for
scalability and reliability in systems spanning the range of aerospace, industrial, and medical applications.
Since V3, Nucleus RTOS (incl. its modules, e.g. Nucleus NET) is an integral part of the Nucleus ReadyStart platform.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.first.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-28388
Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.

SUMMARY

Security researchers discovered and disclosed 9 vulnerabilities in several DNS implementations, also known as “NAME:WRECK” vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities described in this advisory are from this set.

The DNS client of the networking component (Nucleus NET) in Nucleus Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) contains two out of bounds write vulnerabilities in the handling of DNS responses that could allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition or to remotely execute code.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not available.
