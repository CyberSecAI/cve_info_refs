Shibboleth Identity Provider Security Advisory [2 October 2019]
Denial of service via External authentication flows
===================================================
The Shibboleth Identity Provider supports a number of login flows that
rely on servlets or JSP pages to operate, including External, RemoteUser,
X509, and SPNEGO.
These flows are vulnerable to a denial of service attack by a remote,
unauthenticated attacker, via Java heap exhaustion due to the creation
of objects in the Java Servlet container session.
Deployments that make use of any of these login flows, either directly
or via the MFA flow, are vulnerable to this issue.
The flows have been redesigned to avoid the creation of objects outside
of existing controls that limit the number of webflow conversations
that can be created without older state being released to the garbage
collection process.
The redesign required API changes to a pair of classes that would
ordinarily not be permitted in a patch release, but direct use of these
classes by deployers has been deemed unlikely and existing External/etc.
login flow deployments remain compatible with the upgrade.
Affected Versions
=================
Versions of the Identity Provider between V3.0.0 and V3.4.5
Recommendations
===============
Upgrade to Identity Provider V3.4.6 or later.
