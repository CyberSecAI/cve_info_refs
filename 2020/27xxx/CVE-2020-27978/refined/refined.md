- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the creation of objects within the Java Servlet container session during external authentication flows (External, RemoteUser, X509, and SPNEGO). These objects were not managed by existing controls, leading to a potential Java heap exhaustion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper control over session object creation in specific login flows, resulting in a resource exhaustion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by repeatedly initiating the vulnerable login flows, causing the Java heap to be exhausted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending requests to specific login flows (External, RemoteUser, X509, SPNEGO) directly or through the MFA flow. This can be done remotely and without requiring prior authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Identity Provider. No specific privileges or authenticated access is required.
