The provided content is a commit diff from the scratch-svg-renderer project, specifically focusing on changes to `src/fixup-svg-string.js`. This file is designed to sanitize SVG strings.

Based on the provided diff, here's a breakdown relevant to potential vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of potentially malicious code embedded within SVG files, particularly through the use of JavaScript within `<script>` tags and the use of event handlers which could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Script tag execution:** Unsanitized SVG strings might contain `<script>` tags with JavaScript code. This could allow for execution of arbitrary code when the SVG is rendered.
- **Event handlers:** SVG elements can have event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`). These handlers can contain JavaScript code that is executed upon the event's trigger. If not sanitized, this presents an XSS risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** A successful attack could lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of the application rendering the SVG. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Modify content of the page
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Though not explicitly mentioned, it is theoretically possible that overly complex or malicious scripts could result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious SVG files:** An attacker could craft a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript in `<script>` tags or event handlers.
- **User-supplied SVG strings:** An application that accepts user-supplied SVG strings and renders them without sanitization is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious SVG file or SVG string into the application.
- This injection might occur through:
   - Uploading the malicious file.
   - Inserting the malicious string into a field that ends up being rendered as an SVG.

**Changes made in the provided commit:**

The commit addresses these issues by:

- **Removing `<script>` tags**: replacing them with empty `<script></script>` tags which effectively disable them.
- **Removing `onerror` attributes**: removes error handlers.
- **Removing various event handlers**: A wide range of event handlers are removed from the SVG, such as `onbegin`, `onend`, `onclick`, `onload`, etc., to prevent their execution and mitigate XSS risks.

While this commit addresses the vulnerabilities, the specific CVE (CVE-2020-27428) needs to be investigated further to ascertain if the commit addresses all of its aspects, as the CVE description is currently a placeholder.
