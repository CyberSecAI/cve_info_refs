Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27027:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing package name being set on the intent for EapFailureNotifier and SimRequiredNotifier. This oversight allowed other applications to potentially intercept and hijack these intents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Intent Hijacking:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for intent hijacking. Because the intent did not specify a target package, any application on the system could intercept and process it.
- **Missing Package Name:** The core issue is that the intent lacks a package name, which would restrict its delivery to the intended recipient, EapFailureNotifier and SimRequiredNotifier.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially intercept and manipulate the intent, possibly leading to unexpected behavior of the notification or even information disclosure by controlling the content of the notification.
- The primary impact is that an attacker could potentially interfere with Wi-Fi connection notifications.

**Attack vectors:**

- A malicious app installed on the Android device would need to register an intent filter that matches the specific action of the affected intent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would need to have an application installed on the vulnerable Android device.
- The malicious app needs to be able to register the intent filter and receive the broadcasted intents.

**Additional details:**

- The fix includes setting the package name on the intents for `EapFailureNotifier` and `SimRequiredNotifier`. This ensures that the intent is delivered only to the correct system application and prevents hijacking by other apps.
- The provided code change includes the commit message "Wifi: Set package name on the intent" which indicates the specific component being fixed.
- The commit also mentions that tests were performed to verify the fix which involved confirming that the app can no longer hijack the intent.
