{
  "CVE-2020-27674": {
    "Description": "x86 PV guest kernels may use hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior to invalidate TLB entries even after changes to non-leaf page tables. Such changes to non-leaf page tables will, however, also render stale possible TLB entries created by Xen's internal use of linear page tables to process guest requests like update-va-mapping. Invalidation of these TLB entries has been missing, allowing subsequent guest requests to change address mappings for one process to potentially modify memory meanwhile in use elsewhere.",
    "Root cause": "Missing TLB invalidation after changes to non-leaf page tables during hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior, specifically when Xen is using linear page tables to process guest requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete TLB invalidation",
        "Incorrect handling of memory mappings"
    ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation from malicious x86 PV guest user mode to guest kernel level.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted hypercalls by x86 PV guest user mode"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute code within an x86 PV guest user mode."
  }
