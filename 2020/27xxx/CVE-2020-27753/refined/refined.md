Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from memory leaks within the MIFF coder (`/coders/miff.c`) in ImageMagick. These leaks are caused by improper handling of image depth values when processing specially crafted input files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Memory leaks occur due to incorrect data handling within the MIFF coder, specifically when data is passed to the `AcquireMagickMemory()` function. Although initially detected in `AcquireMagickMemory()`, the root cause lies in the MIFF coder's incorrect processing of data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The memory leaks can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or impact application availability. This is because the leaks will cause the application to consume memory until it crashes or becomes unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted input file to ImageMagick that triggers the memory leaks within the MIFF coder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious or specially crafted image file, specifically in MIFF format, to an application using ImageMagick for processing.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is triggered due to the way the MIFF coder handles image depth values, which leads to incorrect memory allocation and subsequent leaks.
- The provided content also mentions the fix was implemented in ImageMagick version 7.0.9-0.
