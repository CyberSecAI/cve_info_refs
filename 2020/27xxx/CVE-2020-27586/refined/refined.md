Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information by Quick Heal Total Security software. Specifically, when submitting quarantined files or sysinfo files for analysis, the software transmits this data without encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (CWE-319)
- Lack of encryption during communication with Quick Heal servers

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept and view the transmitted quarantined files or system information. This could expose sensitive user data present within the quarantined files, or system information that might be used to identify the target.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the victim's machine and the Quick Heal servers to intercept traffic (MITM).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Quick Heal Total Security versions prior to 19.0.
- The specific data transmitted in cleartext includes quarantined files and system information files.
