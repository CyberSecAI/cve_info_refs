net\_sched: commit action insertions together
commit 0fedc63fadf0404a729e73a35349481c8009c02f upstream.
syzbot is able to trigger a failure case inside the loop in
tcf\_action\_init(), and when this happens we clean up with
tcf\_action\_destroy(). But, as these actions are already inserted
into the global IDR, other parallel process could free them
before tcf\_action\_destroy(), then we will trigger a use-after-free.
Fix this by deferring the insertions even later, after the loop,
and committing all the insertions in a separate loop, so we will
never fail in the middle of the insertions any more.
One side effect is that the window between alloction and final
insertion becomes larger, now it is more likely that the loop in
tcf\_del\_walker() sees the placeholder -EBUSY pointer. So we have
to check for error pointer in tcf\_del\_walker().

net\_sched: defer tcf\_idr\_insert() in tcf\_action\_init\_1()
commit e49d8c22f1261c43a986a7fdbf677ac309682a07 upstream.
All TC actions call tcf\_idr\_insert() for new action at the end
of their ->init(), so we can actually move it to a central place
in tcf\_action\_init\_1().
And once the action is inserted into the global IDR, other parallel
process could free it immediately as its refcnt is still 1, so we can
not fail after this, we need to move it after the goto action
validation to avoid handling the failure case after insertion.
This is found during code review, is not directly triggered by syzbot.
And this prepares for the next patch.

net: usb: rtl8150: set random MAC address when set\_ethernet\_addr() fails
commit f45a4248ea4cc13ed50618ff066849f9587226b2 upstream.
When get\_registers() fails in set\_ethernet\_addr(),the uninitialized
value of node\_id gets copied over as the address.
So, check the return value of get\_registers().
If get\_registers() executed successfully (i.e., it returns
sizeof(node\_id)), copy over the MAC address using ether\_addr\_copy()
(instead of using memcpy()).
Else, if get\_registers() failed instead, a randomly generated MAC
address is set as the MAC address instead.

tty/vt: Do not warn when huge selection requested
commit 44c413d9a51752056d606bf6f312003ac1740fab upstream.
The tty TIOCL\_SETSEL ioctl allocates a memory buffer big enough for text
selection area. The maximum allowed console size is
VC\_RESIZE\_MAXCOL \* VC\_RESIZE\_MAXROW == 32767\*32767 == ~1GB and typical
MAX\_ORDER is set to allow allocations lot less than than (circa 16MB).
So it is quite possible to trigger huge allocation (and syzkaller just
did that) which is going to fail (which is fine) with a backtrace in
mm/page\_alloc.c at WARN\_ON\_ONCE(!(gfp\_mask & \_\_GFP\_NOWARN)) and
this may trigger panic (if panic\_on\_warn is enabled) and
leak kernel addresses to dmesg.
This passes \_\_GFP\_NOWARN to kmalloc\_array to avoid unnecessary user-
triggered WARN\_ON. Note that the error is not ignored and
the warning is still printed.

net: bridge: fdb: don't flush ext\_learn entries
commit f2f3729fb65c5c2e6db234e6316b71a7bdc4b30b upstream.
When a user-space software manages fdb entries externally it should
set the ext\_learn flag which marks the fdb entry as externally managed
and avoids expiring it (they're treated as static fdbs). Unfortunately
on events where fdb entries are flushed (STP down, netlink fdb flush
etc) these fdbs are also deleted automatically by the bridge. That in turn
causes trouble for the managing user-space software (e.g. in MLAG setups
we lose remote fdb entries on port flaps).
These entries are completely externally managed so we should avoid
automatically deleting them, the only exception are offloaded entries
(i.e. BR\_FDB\_ADDED\_BY\_EXT\_LEARN + BR\_FDB\_OFFLOADED). They are flushed as
before.

net/core: check length before updating Ethertype in skb\_mpls\_{push,pop}
commit 4296adc3e32f5d544a95061160fe7e127be1b9ff upstream.
Openvswitch allows to drop a packet's Ethernet header, therefore
skb\_mpls\_push() and skb\_mpls\_pop() might be called with ethernet=true
and mac\_len=0. In that case the pointer passed to skb\_mod\_eth\_type()
doesn't point to an Ethernet header and the new Ethertype is written at
unexpected locations.
Fix this by verifying that mac\_len is big enough to contain an Ethernet
header.

tcp: fix receive window update in tcp\_add\_backlog()
commit 86bccd0367130f481ca99ba91de1c6a5aa1c78c1 upstream.
We got reports from GKE customers flows being reset by netfilter
conntrack unless nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_be\_liberal is set to 1.
Traces seemed to suggest ACK packet being dropped by the
packet capture, or more likely that ACK were received in the
wrong order.
wscale=7, SYN and SYNACK not shown here.
This ACK allows the sender to send 1871\*128 bytes from seq 51359321 :

Receiver now allows to send 606\*128=77568 from seq 51521241 :

netfilter conntrack is not happy and sends RST

09:17:23.389488 IP B > A: Flags [R], seq 174478967, win 0, length 0
Now imagine ACK were delivered out of order and tcp\_add\_backlog() sets window based on wrong packet.
New right edge of the window -> 51521241+859\*128=51631193
Normally TCP stack handles OOO packets just fine, but it
turns out tcp\_add\_backlog() does not. It can update the window
field of the aggregated packet even if the ACK sequence
of the last received packet is too old.
Many thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux for independently reporting the issue
and suggesting a fix.

mm: khugepaged: recalculate min\_free\_kbytes after memory hotplug as expected by khugepaged
commit 4aab2be0983031a05cb4a19696c9da5749523426 upstream.
When memory is hotplug added or removed the min\_free\_kbytes should be
recalculated based on what is expected by khugepaged. Currently after
hotplug, min\_free\_kbytes will be set to a lower default and higher
default set when THP enabled is lost.
This change restores min\_free\_kbytes as expected for THP consumers.

[ Upstream commit 4243219141b67d7c2fdb2d8073c17c539b9263eb ]
In mmc\_queue\_setup\_discard() the mmc driver queue's discard\_granularity
might be set as 0 (when card->pref\_erase > max\_discard) while the mmc
device still declares to support discard operation. This is buggy and
triggered the following kernel warning message,

This patch fixes the issue by setting discard\_granularity as SECTOR\_SIZE
instead of 0 when (card->pref\_erase > max\_discard) is true. Now no more
complain from \_\_blkdev\_issue\_discard() for the improper value of discard
granularity.
This issue is exposed after commit b35fd7422c2f ("block: check queue's
limits.discard\_granularity in \_\_blkdev\_issue\_discard()"), a "Fixes:" tag
is also added for the commit to make sure people won't miss this patch

afs: Fix deadlock between writeback and truncate
[ Upstream commit ec0fa0b659144d9c68204d23f627b6a65fa53e50 ]
The afs filesystem has a lock[\*] that it uses to serialise I/O operations
going to the server (vnode->io\_lock), as the server will only perform one
modification operation at a time on any given file or directory. This
prevents the the filesystem from filling up all the call slots to a server
with calls that aren't going to be executed in parallel anyway, thereby
allowing operations on other files to obtain slots.
[\*] Note that is probably redundant for directories at least since
i\_rwsem is used to serialise directory modifications and
lookup/reading vs modification. The server does allow parallel
non-modification ops, however.
When a file truncation op completes, we truncate the in-memory copy of the
file to match - but we do it whilst still holding the io\_lock, the idea
being to prevent races with other operations.
However, if writeback starts in a worker thread simultaneously with
truncation (whilst notify\_change() is called with i\_rwsem locked, writeback
pays it no heed), it may manage to set PG\_writeback bits on the pages that
will get truncated before afs\_setattr\_success() manages to call
truncate\_pagecache(). Truncate will then wait for those pages - whilst
still inside io\_lock:
# cat /proc/8837/stack
[<0>] wait\_on\_page\_bit\_common+0x184/0x1e7
[<0>] truncate\_inode\_pages\_range+0x37f/0x3eb

[<0>] do\_syscall\_64+0x2d/0x3a
[<0>] entry\_SYSCALL\_64\_after\_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
The writeback operation, however, stalls indefinitely because it needs to
get the io\_lock to proceed:
# cat /proc/5940/stack
[<0>] afs\_get\_io\_locks+0x58/0x1ae
[<0>] afs\_begin\_vnode\_operation+0xc7/0xd1

[<0>] worker\_thread+0x117/0x1b9
[<0>] kthread+0xec/0xf1
[<0>] ret\_from\_fork+0x1f/0x30
and thus deadlock has occurred.
Note that whilst afs\_setattr() calls filemap\_write\_and\_wait(), the fact
that the caller is holding i\_rwsem doesn't preclude more pages being
dirtied through an mmap'd region.
Fix this by:
(1) Use the vnode validate\_lock to mediate access between afs\_setattr()
and afs\_writepages():
(a) Exclusively lock validate\_lock in afs\_setattr() around the whole
RPC operation.
(b) If WB\_SYNC\_ALL isn't set on entry to afs\_writepages(), trying to
shared-lock validate\_lock and returning immediately if we couldn't
get it.
(c) If WB\_SYNC\_ALL is set, wait for the lock.
The validate\_lock is also used to validate a file and to zap its cache
if the file was altered by a third party, so it's probably a good fit
for this.
(2) Move the truncation outside of the io\_lock in setattr, using the same
hook as is used for local directory editing.
This requires the old i\_size to be retained in the operation record as
we commit the revised status to the inode members inside the io\_lock
still, but we still need to know if we reduced the file size.

net: mscc: ocelot: divide watermark value by 60 when writing to SYS\_ATOP

Tail dropping is enabled for a port when:
1. A source port consumes more packet buffers than the watermark encoded

AND
2. Total memory use exceeds the consumption watermark encoded in

The unit of these watermarks is a 60 byte memory cell. That unit is
programmed properly into ATOP\_TOT\_CFG, but not into ATOP. Actually when
written into ATOP, it would get truncated and wrap around.

vhost-vdpa: fix page pinning leakage in error path

Pinned pages are not properly accounted particularly when
mapping error occurs on IOTLB update. Clean up dangling
pinned pages for the error path. As the inflight pinned
pages, specifically for memory region that strides across
multiple chunks, would need more than one free page for
book keeping and accounting. For simplicity, pin pages
for all memory in the IOVA range in one go rather than
have multiple pin\_user\_pages calls to make up the entire
region. This way it's easier to track and account the
pages already mapped, particularly for clean-up in the
error path.

net: stmmac: Modify configuration method of EEE timers

Ethtool manual stated that the tx-timer is the "the amount of time the
device should stay in idle mode prior to asserting its Tx LPI". The
previous implementation for "ethtool --set-eee tx-timer" sets the LPI TW
timer duration which is not correct. Hence, this patch fixes the
"ethtool --set-eee tx-timer" to configure the EEE LPI timer.
The LPI TW Timer will be using the defined default value instead of
"ethtool --set-eee tx-timer" which follows the EEE LS timer implementation.
Changelog V2
\*Not removing/modifying the eee\_timer.
\*EEE LPI timer can be configured through ethtool and also the eee\_timer
module param.
\*EEE TW Timer will be configured with default value only, not able to be
configured through ethtool or module param. This follows the implementation
of the EEE LS Timer.

[ Upstream commit 1253935ad801485270194d5651acab04abc97b36 ]
Current neigh update event handler implementation takes reference to
neighbour structure, assigns it to nhe->n, tries to schedule workqueue task
and releases the reference if task was already enqueued. This results
potentially overwriting existing nhe->n pointer with another neighbour
instance, which causes double release of the instance (once in neigh update
handler that failed to enqueue to workqueue and another one in neigh update
workqueue task that processes updated nhe->n pointer instead of original
one):

net/mlx5e: Fix VLAN create flow

When interface is attached while in promiscuous mode and with VLAN
filtering turned off, both configurations are not respected and VLAN
filtering is performed.
There are 2 flows which add the any-vid rules during interface attach:
VLAN creation table and set rx mode. Each is relaying on the other to
add any-vid rules, eventually non of them does.
Fix this by adding any-vid rules on VLAN creation regardless of
promiscuous mode.

net/mlx5e: Fix VLAN cleanup flow

Prior to this patch unloading an interface in promiscuous mode with RX
VLAN filtering feature turned off - resulted in a warning. This is due
to a wrong condition in the VLAN rules cleanup flow, which left the
any-vid rules in the VLAN steering table. These rules prevented
destroying the flow group and the flow table.
The any-vid rules are removed in 2 flows, but none of them remove it in
case both promiscuous is set and VLAN filtering is off. Fix the issue by
changing the condition of the VLAN table cleanup flow to clean also in
case of promiscuous mode.

net/mlx5e: Add resiliency in Striding RQ mode for packets larger than MTU
[ Upstream commit c3c9402373fe20e2d08c04f437ce4dcd252cffb2 ]
Prior to this fix, in Striding RQ mode the driver was vulnerable when
receiving packets in the range (stride size - headroom, stride size].
Where stride size is calculated by mtu+headroom+tailroom aligned to the
closest power of 2.
Usually, this filtering is performed by the HW, except for a few cases:
- Between 2 VFs over the same PF with different MTUs
- On bluefield, when the host physical function sets a larger MTU than
the ARM has configured on its representor and uplink representor.
When the HW filtering is not present, packets that are larger than MTU
might be harmful for the RQ's integrity, in the following impacts:
1) Overflow from one WQE to the next, causing a memory corruption that
in most cases is unharmful: as the write happens to the headroom of next
packet, which will be overwritten by build\_skb(). In very rare cases,
high stress/load, this is harmful. When the next WQE is not yet reposted
and points to existing SKB head.
2) Each oversize packet overflows to the headroom of the next WQE. On
the last WQE of the WQ, where addresses wrap-around, the address of the
remainder headroom does not belong to the next WQE, but it is out of the
memory region range. This results in a HW CQE error that moves the RQ
into an error state.
Solution:
Add a page buffer at the end of each WQE to absorb the leak. Actually
the maximal overflow size is headroom but since all memory units must be
of the same size, we use page size to comply with UMR WQEs. The increase
in memory consumption is of a single page per RQ. Initialize the mkey
with all MTTs pointing to a default page. When the channels are
activated, UMR WQEs will redirect the RX WQEs to the actual memory from
the RQ's pool, while the overflow MTTs remain mapped to the default page.

net/mlx5: poll cmd EQ in case of command timeout
[ Upstream commit 1d5558b1f0de81f54ddee05f3793acc5260d107f ]
Once driver detects a command interface command timeout, it warns the
user and returns timeout error to the caller. In such case, the entry of
the command is not evacuated (because only real event interrupt is allowed
to clear command interface entry). If the HW event interrupt
of this entry will never arrive, this entry will be left unused forever.
Command interface entries are limited and eventually we can end up without
the ability to post a new command.
In addition, if driver will not consume the EQE of the lost interrupt and
rearm the EQ, no new interrupts will arrive for other commands.
Add a resiliency mechanism for manually polling the command EQ in case of
a command timeout. In case resiliency mechanism will find non-handled EQE,
it will consume it, and the command interface will be fully functional
again. Once the resiliency flow finished, wait another 5 seconds for the
command interface to complete for this command entry.
Define mlx5\_cmd\_eq\_recover() to manage the cmd EQ polling resiliency flow.
Add an async EQ spinlock to avoid races between resiliency flows and real
interrupts that might run simultaneously.

net/mlx5: Avoid possible free of command entry while timeout comp handler
[ Upstream commit 50b2412b7e7862c5af0cbf4b10d93bc5c712d021 ]
Upon command completion timeout, driver simulates a forced command
completion. In a rare case where real interrupt for that command arrives
simultaneously, it might release the command entry while the forced
handler might still access it.
Fix that by adding an entry refcount, to track current amount of allowed
handlers. Command entry to be released only when this refcount is
decremented to zero.
Command refcount is always initialized to one. For callback commands,
command completion handler is the symmetric flow to decrement it. For
non-callback commands, it is wait\_func().
Before ringing the doorbell, increment the refcount for the real completion
handler. Once the real completion handler is called, it will decrement it.
For callback commands, once the delayed work is scheduled, increment the
refcount. Upon callback command completion handler, we will try to cancel
the timeout callback. In case of success, we need to decrement the callback
refcount as it will never run.
In addition, gather the entry index free and the entry free into a one
flow for all command types release.

net/mlx5: Fix a race when moving command interface to polling mode
[ Upstream commit 432161ea26d6d5e5c3f7306d9407d26ed1e1953e ]
As part of driver unload, it destroys the commands EQ (via FW command).
As the commands EQ is destroyed, FW will not generate EQEs for any command
that driver sends afterwards. Driver should poll for later commands status.
Driver commands mode metadata is updated before the commands EQ is
actually destroyed. This can lead for double completion handle by the
driver (polling and interrupt), if a command is executed and completed by
FW after the mode was changed, but before the EQ was destroyed.
Fix that by using the mlx5\_cmd\_allowed\_opcode mechanism to guarantee
that only DESTROY\_EQ command can be executed during this time period.

pipe: Fix memory leaks in create\_pipe\_files()

Calling pipe2() with O\_NOTIFICATION\_PIPE could results in memory
leaks unless watch\_queue\_init() is successful.
In case of watch\_queue\_init() failure in pipe2() we are left
with inode and pipe\_inode\_info instances that need to be freed. That
failure exit has been introduced in commit c73be61cede5 ("pipe: Add
general notification queue support") and its handling should've been
identical to nearby treatment of alloc\_file\_pseudo() failures - it
is dealing with the same situation. As it is, the mainline kernel
leaks in that case.
Another problem is that CONFIG\_WATCH\_QUEUE and !CONFIG\_WATCH\_QUEUE
cases are treated differently (and the former leaks just pipe\_inode\_info,
the latter - both pipe\_inode\_info and inode).
Fixed by providing a dummy wacth\_queue\_init() in !CONFIG\_WATCH\_QUEUE
case and by having failures of wacth\_queue\_init() handled the same way
we handle alloc\_file\_pseudo() ones.

msgs\_acked. Since the new thread sees msgs\_acked == msgs\_sent
it will try to allocate a new message and to send a new mbox
message to PF.Now if mbox\_reset is scheduled in, PF will see
'0' in msgs\_send.
This patch fixes the issue by calling mbox\_reset before
incrementing msgs\_acked flag for last processing message and
checks for valid message size.

net: phy: realtek: fix rtl8211e rx/tx delay config
[ Upstream commit bbc4d71d63549bcd003a430de18a72a742d8c91e ]
There are two chip pins named TXDLY and RXDLY which actually adds the 2ns
delays to TXC and RXC for TXD/RXD latching. These two pins can config via
4.7k-ohm resistor to 3.3V hw setting, but also config via software setting
(extension page 0xa4 register 0x1c bit13 12 and 11).
The configuration register definitions from table 13 official PHY datasheet:
PHYAD[2:0] = PHY Address
AN[1:0] = Auto-Negotiation
Mode = Interface Mode Select
RX Delay = RX Delay
TX Delay = TX Delay
SELRGV = RGMII/GMII Selection
This table describes how to config these hw pins via external pull-high or pull-
low resistor.
It is a misunderstanding that mapping it as register bits below:
8:6 = PHY Address
5:4 = Auto-Negotiation
3 = Interface Mode Select
2 = RX Delay
1 = TX Delay
0 = SELRGV
So I removed these descriptions above and add related settings as below:
14 = reserved
13 = force Tx RX Delay controlled by bit12 bit11
12 = Tx Delay
11 = Rx Delay
10:0 = Test && debug settings reserved by realtek
Test && debug settings are not recommend to modify by default.

ice: fix memory leak in ice\_vsi\_setup
[ Upstream commit f6a07271bb1535d9549380461437cc48d9e19958 ]
During ice\_vsi\_setup, if ice\_cfg\_vsi\_lan fails, it does not properly
release memory associated with the VSI rings. If we had used devres
allocations for the rings, this would be ok. However, we use kzalloc and
kfree\_rcu for these ring structures.
Using the correct label to cleanup the rings during ice\_vsi\_setup
highlights an issue in the ice\_vsi\_clear\_rings function: it can leave
behind stale ring pointers in the q\_vectors structure.
When releasing rings, we must also ensure that no q\_vector associated
with the VSI will point to this ring again. To resolve this, loop over
all q\_vectors and release their ring mapping. Because we are about to
free all rings, no q\_vector should remain pointing to any of the rings
in this VSI.

The ice\_setup\_pf\_sw function can cause a memory leak if register\_netdev
fails, due to accidentally failing to free the VSI rings. Fix the memory
leak by using ice\_vsi\_release, ensuring we actually go through the full
teardown process.
This should be safe even if the netdevice is not registered because we
will have set the netdev pointer to NULL, ensuring ice\_vsi\_release won't
call unregister\_netdev.
An alternative fix would be moving management of the PF VSI netdev into
the main VSI setup code. This is complicated and likely requires
significant refactor in how we manage VSIs

xfrm: Use correct address family in xfrm\_state\_find
[ Upstream commit e94ee171349db84c7cfdc5fefbebe414054d0924 ]
The struct flowi must never be interpreted by itself as its size
depends on the address family. Therefore it must always be grouped
with its original family value.
In this particular instance, the original family value is lost in
the function xfrm\_state\_find. Therefore we get a bogus read when
it's coupled with the wrong family which would occur with inter-
family xfrm states.
This patch fixes it by keeping the original family value.
Note that the same bug could potentially occur in LSM through
the xfrm\_state\_pol\_flow\_match hook. I checked the current code
there and it seems to be safe for now as only secid is used which
is part of struct flowi\_common. But that API should be changed
so that so that we don't get new bugs in the future. We could
do that by replacing fl with just secid or adding a family field.

When LG\_LAPTOP is enabled and NEW\_LEDS is disabled, it results in the
following Kbuild warning:
WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for LEDS\_CLASS
Depends on [n]: NEW\_LEDS [=n]
Selected by [y]:
- LG\_LAPTOP [=y] && X86 [=y] && X86\_PLATFORM\_DEVICES [=y] && ACPI [=y] && ACPI\_WMI [=y] && INPUT [=y]
The reason is that LG\_LAPTOP selects LEDS\_CLASS without depending on or
selecting NEW\_LEDS while LEDS\_CLASS is subordinate to NEW\_LEDS.
Honor the kconfig menu hierarchy to remove kconfig dependency warnings.

net: stmmac: removed enabling eee in EEE set callback
[ Upstream commit 7241c5a697479c7d0c5a96595822cdab750d41ae ]
EEE should be only be enabled during stmmac\_mac\_link\_up() when the
link are up and being set up properly. set\_eee should only do settings
configuration and disabling the eee.
Without this fix, turning on EEE using ethtool will return
"Operation not supported". This is due to the driver is in a dead loop
waiting for eee to be advertised in the for eee to be activated but the
driver will only configure the EEE advertisement after the eee is
activated.
Ethtool should only return "Operation not supported" if there is no EEE
capbility in the MAC controller.

xsk: Do not discard packet when NETDEV\_TX\_BUSY
[ Upstream commit 642e450b6b5955f2059d0ae372183f7c6323f951 ]
In the skb Tx path, transmission of a packet is performed with
dev\_direct\_xmit(). When NETDEV\_TX\_BUSY is set in the drivers, it
signifies that it was not possible to send the packet right now,
please try later. Unfortunately, the xsk transmit code discarded the
packet and returned EBUSY to the application. Fix this unnecessary
packet loss, by not discarding the packet in the Tx ring and return
EAGAIN. As EAGAIN is returned to the application, it can then retry
the send operation later and the packet will then likely be sent as
the driver will then likely have space/resources to send the packet.
In summary, EAGAIN tells the application that the packet was not
discarded from the Tx ring and that it needs to call send()
again. EBUSY, on the other hand, signifies that the packet was not
sent and discarded from the Tx ring. The application needs to put
the packet on the Tx ring again if it wants it to be sent.

btrfs: move btrfs\_rm\_dev\_replace\_free\_srcdev outside of all locks
[ Upstream commit a466c85edc6fbe845facc8f57c408c544f42899e ]
When closing and freeing the source device we could end up doing our
final blkdev\_put() on the bdev, which will grab the bd\_mutex. As such
we want to be holding as few locks as possible, so move this call
outside of the dev\_replace->lock\_finishing\_cancel\_unmount lock. Since
we're modifying the fs\_devices we need to make sure we're holding the
uuid\_mutex here, so take that as well.
There's a report from syzbot probably hitting one of the cases where
the bd\_mutex and device\_list\_mutex are taken in the wrong order, however
it's not with device replace, like this patch fixes. As there's no
reproducer available so far, we can't verify the fix.

Fix this by just not diving into details if we fail to trylock the
io\_uring mutex. We know the ctx isn't going away during this operation,
but we cannot safely iterate buffers/files/personalities if we don't
hold the io\_uring mutex.

We need to move the closing of the src\_device out of all the device
replace locking, but we definitely want to zero out the superblock
before we commit the last time to make sure the device is properly
removed. Handle this by pushing btrfs\_scratch\_superblocks into
btrfs\_dev\_replace\_finishing, and then later on we'll move the src\_device
closing and freeing stuff where we need it to be.

openvswitch: handle DNAT tuple collision
commit 8aa7b526dc0b5dbf40c1b834d76a667ad672a410 upstream.
With multiple DNAT rules it's possible that after destination
translation the resulting tuples collide.
For example, two openvswitch flows:
nw\_dst=10.0.0.10,tp\_dst=10, actions=ct(commit,table=2,nat(dst=20.0.0.1:20))
nw\_dst=10.0.0.20,tp\_dst=10, actions=ct(commit,table=2,nat(dst=20.0.0.1:20))
Assuming two TCP clients initiating the following connections:
10.0.0.10:5000->10.0.0.10:10
10.0.0.10:5000->10.0.0.20:10
Both tuples would translate to 10.0.0.10:5000->20.0.0.1:20 causing
nf\_conntrack\_confirm() to fail because of tuple collision.
Netfilter handles this case by allocating a null binding for SNAT at
egress by default. Perform the same operation in openvswitch for DNAT
if no explicit SNAT is requested by the user and allocate a null binding
for SNAT for packets in the "original" direction.

net: team: fix memory leak in \_\_team\_options\_register
commit 9a9e77495958c7382b2438bc19746dd3aaaabb8e upstream.
The variable "i" isn't initialized back correctly after the first loop
under the label inst\_rollback gets executed.
The value of "i" is assigned to be option\_count - 1, and the ensuing
loop (under alloc\_rollback) begins by initializing i--.
Thus, the value of i when the loop begins execution will now become
i = option\_count - 2.
Thus, when kfree(dst\_opts[i]) is called in the second loop in this
order, (i.e., inst\_rollback followed by alloc\_rollback),
dst\_optsp[option\_count - 2] is the first element freed, and
dst\_opts[option\_count - 1] does not get freed, and thus, a memory
leak is caused.
This memory leak can be fixed, by assigning i = option\_count (instead of
option\_count - 1).

SCL rate appears to be different than what is expected. For example,
We get 164kHz on i2c3 of the vim3 when 400kHz is expected. This is
partially due to the peripheral clock being disabled when the clock is

Let's keep the peripheral clock on after probe to fix the problem. This
does not affect the SCL output which is still gated when i2c is idle.

On setxattr() syscall path due to an apprent typo the size of a dynamically
allocated memory chunk for storing struct smb2\_file\_full\_ea\_info object is
computed incorrectly, to be more precise the first addend is the size of
a pointer instead of the wanted object size. Coincidentally it makes no
difference on 64-bit platforms, however on 32-bit targets the following
memcpy() writes 4 bytes of data outside of the dynamically allocated memory.

Xiumei reported a bug with espintcp over IPv6 in transport mode,
because xfrm6\_transport\_finish expects to find IP6CB data (struct
inet6\_skb\_cb). Currently, espintcp zeroes the CB, but the relevant
part is actually preserved by previous layers (first set up by tcp,
then strparser only zeroes a small part of tcp\_skb\_tb), so we can just
relocate it to the start of skb->cb.

nvme-tcp: check page by sendpage\_ok() before calling kernel\_sendpage()
commit 7d4194abfc4de13a2663c7fee6891de8360f7a52 upstream.
Currently nvme\_tcp\_try\_send\_data() doesn't use kernel\_sendpage() to
send slab pages. But for pages allocated by \_\_get\_free\_pages() without
\_\_GFP\_COMP, which also have refcount as 0, they are still sent by
kernel\_sendpage() to remote end, this is problematic.
The new introduced helper sendpage\_ok() checks both PageSlab tag and
page\_count counter, and returns true if the checking page is OK to be
sent by kernel\_sendpage().
This patch fixes the page checking issue of nvme\_tcp\_try\_send\_data()
with sendpage\_ok(). If sendpage\_ok() returns true, send this page by
kernel\_sendpage(), otherwise use sock\_no\_sendpage to handle this page.

tcp: use sendpage\_ok() to detect misused .sendpage
commit cf83a17edeeb36195596d2dae060a7c381db35f1 upstream.
commit a10674bf2406 ("tcp: detecting the misuse of .sendpage for Slab
objects") adds the checks for Slab pages, but the pages don't have
page\_count are still missing from the check.
Network layer's sendpage method is not designed to send page\_count 0
pages neither, therefore both PageSlab() and page\_count() should be
both checked for the sending page. This is exactly what sendpage\_ok()
does.
This patch uses sendpage\_ok() in do\_tcp\_sendpages() to detect misused
.sendpage, to make the code more robust.

net: introduce helper sendpage\_ok() in include/linux/net.h
commit c381b07941adc2274ce552daf86c94701c5e265a upstream.
The original problem was from nvme-over-tcp code, who mistakenly uses
kernel\_sendpage() to send pages allocated by \_\_get\_free\_pages() without
\_\_GFP\_COMP flag. Such pages don't have refcount (page\_count is 0) on
tail pages, sending them by kernel\_sendpage() may trigger a kernel panic
from a corrupted kernel heap, because these pages are incorrectly freed
in network stack as page\_count 0 pages.
This patch introduces a helper sendpage\_ok(), it returns true if the
checking page,
- is not slab page: PageSlab(page) is false.
- has page refcount: page\_count(page) is not zero
All drivers who want to send page to remote end by kernel\_sendpage()
may use this helper to check whether the page is OK. If the helper does
not return true, the driver should try other non sendpage method (e.g.
sock\_no\_sendpage()) to handle the page.

mm/khugepaged: fix filemap page\_to\_pgoff(page) != offset
commit 033b5d77551167f8c24ca862ce83d3e0745f9245 upstream.
There have been elusive reports of filemap\_fault() hitting its
VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(page\_to\_pgoff(page) != offset, page) on kernels built
with CONFIG\_READ\_ONLY\_THP\_FOR\_FS=y.
Suren has hit it on a kernel with CONFIG\_READ\_ONLY\_THP\_FOR\_FS=y and
CONFIG\_NUMA is not set: and he has analyzed it down to how khugepaged
without NUMA reuses the same huge page after collapse\_file() failed
(whereas NUMA targets its allocation to the respective node each time).
And most of us were usually testing with CONFIG\_NUMA=y kernels.
collapse\_file(old start)
new\_page = khugepaged\_alloc\_page(hpage)
\_\_SetPageLocked(new\_page)
new\_page->index = start // hpage->index=old offset
new\_page->mapping = mapping
xas\_store(&xas, new\_page)
filemap\_fault
page = find\_get\_page(mapping, offset)
// if offset falls inside hpage then
// compound\_head(page) == hpage
lock\_page\_maybe\_drop\_mmap()
\_\_lock\_page(page)
// collapse fails
xas\_store(&xas, old page)
new\_page->mapping = NULL
unlock\_page(new\_page)
collapse\_file(new start)
new\_page = khugepaged\_alloc\_page(hpage)
\_\_SetPageLocked(new\_page)
new\_page->index = start // hpage->index=new offset
new\_page->mapping = mapping // mapping becomes valid again
// since compound\_head(page) == hpage
// page\_to\_pgoff(page) got changed
VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(page\_to\_pgoff(page) != offset)
An initial patch replaced \_\_SetPageLocked() by lock\_page(), which did
fix the race which Suren illustrates above. But testing showed that it's
not good enough: if the racing task's \_\_lock\_page() gets delayed long
after its find\_get\_page(), then it may follow collapse\_file(new start)'s
successful final unlock\_page(), and crash on the same VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE.
It could be fixed by relaxing filemap\_fault()'s VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE to a
check and retry (as is done for mapping), with similar relaxations in
find\_lock\_entry() and pagecache\_get\_page(): but it's not obvious what
else might get caught out; and khugepaged non-NUMA appears to be unique
in exposing a page to page cache, then revoking, without going through
a full cycle of freeing before reuse.
Instead, non-NUMA khugepaged\_prealloc\_page() release the old page
if anyone else has a reference to it (1% of cases when I tested).
Although never reported on huge tmpfs, I believe its find\_lock\_entry()
has been at similar risk; but huge tmpfs does not rely on khugepaged
for its normal working nearly so much as READ\_ONLY\_THP\_FOR\_FS does.

platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Switch to an allow-list for SW\_TABLET\_MODE reporting
commit 8169bd3e6e193497cab781acddcff8fde5d0c416 upstream.
2 recent commits:
cfae58ed681c ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only blacklist SW\_TABLET\_MODE
on the 9 / "Laptop" chasis-type")
1fac39fd0316 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode switch on
"Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types")
Enabled reporting of SW\_TABLET\_MODE on more devices since the vbtn ACPI
interface is used by the firmware on some of those devices to report this.
Testing has shown that unconditionally enabling SW\_TABLET\_MODE reporting
on all devices with a chassis type of 8 ("Portable") or 10 ("Notebook")
which support the VGBS method is a very bad idea.
Many of these devices are normal laptops (non 2-in-1) models with a VGBS
which always returns 0, which we translate to SW\_TABLET\_MODE=1. This in
turn causes userspace (libinput) to suppress events from the builtin
keyboard and touchpad, making the laptop essentially unusable.
Since the problem of wrongly reporting SW\_TABLET\_MODE=1 in combination
with libinput, leads to a non-usable system. Where as OTOH many people will
not even notice when SW\_TABLET\_MODE is not being reported, this commit
changes intel\_vbtn\_has\_switches() to use a DMI based allow-list.
The new DMI based allow-list matches on the 31 ("Convertible") and
32 ("Detachable") chassis-types, as these clearly are 2-in-1s and
so far if they support the intel-vbtn ACPI interface they all have
properly working SW\_TABLET\_MODE reporting.
Besides these 2 generic matches, it also contains model specific matches
for 2-in-1 models which use a different chassis-type and which are known
to have properly working SW\_TABLET\_MODE reporting.
This has been tested on the following 2-in-1 devices:
Dell Venue 11 Pro 7130 vPro
HP Pavilion X2 10-p002nd
HP Stream x360 Convertible PC 11
Medion E1239T

r8169: consider that PHY reset may still be in progress after applying firmware
commit 47dda78671a3d5cee3fb2229e37997d2ac8a3b54 upstream.
Some firmware files trigger a PHY soft reset and don't wait for it to
be finished. PHY register writes directly after applying the firmware
may fail or provide unexpected results therefore. Fix this by waiting
for bit BMCR\_RESET to be cleared after applying firmware.
There's nothing wrong with the referenced change, it's just that the
fix will apply cleanly only after this change.

platform/x86: asus-wmi: Fix SW\_TABLET\_MODE always reporting 1 on many different models
commit 1797d588af15174d4a4e7159dac8c800538e4f8c upstream.
Commit b0dbd97de1f1 ("platform/x86: asus-wmi: Add support for
SW\_TABLET\_MODE") added support for reporting SW\_TABLET\_MODE using the
Asus 0x00120063 WMI-device-id to see if various transformer models were
docked into their keyboard-dock (SW\_TABLET\_MODE=0) or if they were
being used as a tablet.
The new SW\_TABLET\_MODE support (naively?) assumed that non Transformer
devices would either not support the 0x00120063 WMI-device-id at all,
or would NOT set ASUS\_WMI\_DSTS\_PRESENCE\_BIT in their reply when querying
the device-id.
Unfortunately this is not true and we have received many bug reports about
this change causing the asus-wmi driver to always report SW\_TABLET\_MODE=1
on non Transformer devices. This causes libinput to think that these are
360 degree hinges style 2-in-1s folded into tablet-mode. Making libinput
suppress keyboard and touchpad events from the builtin keyboard and
touchpad. So effectively this causes the keyboard and touchpad to not work
on many non Transformer Asus models.
This commit fixes this by using the existing DMI based quirk mechanism in
asus-nb-wmi.c to allow using the 0x00120063 device-id for reporting
SW\_TABLET\_MODE on Transformer models and ignoring it on all other models.

platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Fix SW\_TABLET\_MODE always reporting 1 on the HP Pavilion 11 x360
commit d823346876a970522ff9e4d2b323c9b734dcc4de upstream.
Commit cfae58ed681c ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only blacklist
SW\_TABLET\_MODE on the 9 / "Laptop" chasis-type") restored SW\_TABLET\_MODE
reporting on the HP stream x360 11 series on which it was previously broken
by commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet
mode switch on 2-in-1's").
It turns out that enabling SW\_TABLET\_MODE reporting on devices with a
chassis-type of 10 ("Notebook") causes SW\_TABLET\_MODE to always report 1
at boot on the HP Pavilion 11 x360, which causes libinput to disable the
kbd and touchpad.
The HP Pavilion 11 x360's ACPI VGBS method sets bit 4 instead of bit 6 when
NOT in tablet mode at boot. Inspecting all the DSDTs in my DSDT collection
shows only one other model, the Medion E1239T ever setting bit 4 and it
always sets this together with bit 6.
So lets treat bit 4 as a second bit which when set indicates the device not
being in tablet-mode, as we already do for bit 6.
While at it also prefix all VGBS constant defines with "VGBS\_".

splice: teach splice pipe reading about empty pipe buffers
commit d1a819a2ec2d3b5e6a8f8a9f67386bda0ad315bc upstream.
Tetsuo Handa reports that splice() can return 0 before the real EOF, if
the data in the splice source pipe is an empty pipe buffer. That empty
pipe buffer case doesn't happen in any normal situation, but you can
trigger it by doing a write to a pipe that fails due to a page fault.
Tetsuo has a test-case to show the behavior:
#define \_GNU\_SOURCE
#include
#include
#include
#include
int main(int argc, char \*argv[])
{
const int fd = open("/tmp/testfile", O\_WRONLY | O\_CREAT, 0600);
int pipe\_fd[2] = { -1, -1 };
pipe(pipe\_fd);
write(pipe\_fd[1], NULL, 4096);
/\* This splice() should wait unless interrupted. \*/
return !splice(pipe\_fd[0], NULL, fd, NULL, 65536, 0);
}
which results in
write(5, NULL, 4096) = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
splice(4, NULL, 3, NULL, 65536, 0) = 0
and this can confuse splice() users into believing they have hit EOF
prematurely.
The issue was introduced when the pipe write code started pre-allocating
the pipe buffers before copying data from user space.
This is modified verion of Tetsuo's original patch.
Fixes: a194dfe6e6f6 ("pipe: Rearrange sequence in pipe\_write() to preallocate slot")

usermodehelper: reset umask to default before executing user process
commit 4013c1496c49615d90d36b9d513eee8e369778e9 upstream.
Kernel threads intentionally do CLONE\_FS in order to follow any changes
that 'init' does to set up the root directory (or cwd).
It is admittedly a bit odd, but it avoids the situation where 'init'
does some extensive setup to initialize the system environment, and then
we execute a usermode helper program, and it uses the original FS setup
from boot time that may be very limited and incomplete.
[ Both Al Viro and Eric Biederman point out that 'pivot\_root()' will
follow the root regardless, since it fixes up other users of root (see
chroot\_fs\_refs() for details), but overmounting root and doing a
chroot() would not. ]
However, Vegard Nossum noticed that the CLONE\_FS not only means that we
follow the root and current working directories, it also means we share
umask with whatever init changed it to. That wasn't intentional.
Just reset umask to the original default (0022) before actually starting
the usermode helper program.

vhost: Don't call access\_ok() when using IOTLB
commit 0210a8db2aeca393fb3067e234967877e3146266 upstream.
When the IOTLB device is enabled, the vring addresses we get
from userspace are GIOVAs. It is thus wrong to pass them down
to access\_ok() which only takes HVAs.
Access validation is done at prefetch time with IOTLB. Teach
vq\_access\_ok() about that by moving the (vq->iotlb) check
from vhost\_vq\_access\_ok() to vq\_access\_ok(). This prevents
vhost\_vring\_set\_addr() to fail when verifying the accesses.
No behavior change for vhost\_vq\_access\_ok().

commit 39e4716caa598a07a98598b2e7cd03055ce25fb9 upstream.
The AES code uses a 'br x7' as part of a function called by

in a panic as seen below. Using x16 (or x17) with an indirect

bpf: Fix scalar32\_min\_max\_or bounds tracking
commit 5b9fbeb75b6a98955f628e205ac26689bcb1383e upstream.
Simon reported an issue with the current scalar32\_min\_max\_or() implementation.
That is, compared to the other 32 bit subreg tracking functions, the code in
scalar32\_min\_max\_or() stands out that it's using the 64 bit registers instead
of 32 bit ones. This leads to bounds tracking issues, for example:

The bound tests on the map value force the upper unsigned bound to be 25769803777
in 64 bit (0b11000000000000000000000000000000001) and then lower one to be 1. By
using OR they are truncated and thus result in the range [1,1] for the 32 bit reg
tracker. This is incorrect given the only thing we know is that the value must be
positive and thus 2147483647 (0b1111111111111111111111111111111) at max for the
subregs. Fix it by using the {u,s}32\_{min,max}\_value vars instead. This also makes
sense, for example, for the case where we update dst\_reg->s32\_{min,max}\_value in
the else branch we need to use the newly computed dst\_reg->u32\_{min,max}\_value as
we know that these are positive. Previously, in the else branch the 64 bit values
of umin\_value=1 and umax\_value=32212254719 were used and latter got truncated to
be 1 as upper bound there. After the fix the subreg range is now correct:

Revert "ravb: Fixed to be able to unload modules"
commit 77972b55fb9d35d4a6b0abca99abffaa4ec6a85b upstream.
This reverts commit 1838d6c62f57836639bd3d83e7855e0ee4f6defc.
This commit moved the ravb\_mdio\_init() call (and thus the
of\_mdiobus\_register() call) from the ravb\_probe() to the ravb\_open()
call. This causes a regression during system resume (s2idle/s2ram), as
new PHY devices cannot be bound while suspended.
During boot, the Micrel PHY is detected like this:
Micrel KSZ9031 Gigabit PHY e6800000.ethernet-ffffffff:00: attached PHY driver [Micrel KSZ9031 Gigabit PHY] (mii\_bus:phy\_addr=e6800000.ethernet-ffffffff:00, irq=228)
ravb e6800000.ethernet eth0: Link is Up - 1Gbps/Full - flow control off
During system suspend, (A) defer\_all\_probes is set to true, and (B)
usermodehelper\_disabled is set to UMH\_DISABLED, to avoid drivers being
probed while suspended.
A. If CONFIG\_MODULES=n, phy\_device\_register() calling device\_add()
merely adds the device, but does not probe it yet, as
really\_probe() returns early due to defer\_all\_probes being set:
dpm\_resume+0x128/0x4f8
device\_resume+0xcc/0x1b0
dpm\_run\_callback+0x74/0x340
ravb\_resume+0x190/0x1b8
ravb\_open+0x84/0x770
of\_mdiobus\_register+0x1e0/0x468
of\_mdiobus\_register\_phy+0x1b8/0x250
of\_mdiobus\_phy\_device\_register+0x178/0x1e8
phy\_device\_register+0x114/0x1b8
device\_add+0x3d4/0x798
bus\_probe\_device+0x98/0xa0
device\_initial\_probe+0x10/0x18
\_\_device\_attach+0xe4/0x140
bus\_for\_each\_drv+0x64/0xc8
\_\_device\_attach\_driver+0xb8/0xe0
driver\_probe\_device.part.11+0xc4/0xd8
really\_probe+0x32c/0x3b8
Later, phy\_attach\_direct() notices no PHY driver has been bound,
and falls back to the Generic PHY, leading to degraded operation:
Generic PHY e6800000.ethernet-ffffffff:00: attached PHY driver [Generic PHY] (mii\_bus:phy\_addr=e6800000.ethernet-ffffffff:00, irq=POLL)
ravb e6800000.ethernet eth0: Link is Up - 1Gbps/Full - flow control off
B. If CONFIG\_MODULES=y, request\_module() returns early with -EBUSY due
to UMH\_DISABLED, and MDIO initialization fails completely:
mdio\_bus e6800000.ethernet-ffffffff:00: error -16 loading PHY driver module for ID 0x00221622
ravb e6800000.ethernet eth0: failed to initialize MDIO
PM: dpm\_run\_callback(): ravb\_resume+0x0/0x1b8 returns -16
PM: Device e6800000.ethernet failed to resume: error -16
Ignoring -EBUSY in phy\_request\_driver\_module(), like was done for
-ENOENT in commit 21e194425abd65b5 ("net: phy: fix issue with loading
PHY driver w/o initramfs"), would makes it fall back to the Generic
PHY, like in the CONFIG\_MODULES=n case.

fbcon: Fix global-out-of-bounds read in fbcon\_get\_font()
commit 5af08640795b2b9a940c9266c0260455377ae262 upstream.
fbcon\_get\_font() is reading out-of-bounds. A malicious user may resize
`vc->vc\_font.height` to a large value, causing fbcon\_get\_font() to
read out of `fontdata`.
fbcon\_get\_font() handles both built-in and user-provided fonts.
Fortunately, recently we have added FONT\_EXTRA\_WORDS support for built-in
fonts, so fix it by adding range checks using FNTSIZE().
This patch depends on patch "fbdev, newport\_con: Move FONT\_EXTRA\_WORDS
macros into linux/font.h", and patch "Fonts: Support FONT\_EXTRA\_WORDS
macros for built-in fonts".

Fonts: Support FONT\_EXTRA\_WORDS macros for built-in fonts
commit 6735b4632def0640dbdf4eb9f99816aca18c4f16 upstream.
syzbot has reported an issue in the framebuffer layer, where a malicious
user may overflow our built-in font data buffers.
In order to perform a reliable range check, subsystems need to know
`FONTDATAMAX` for each built-in font. Unfortunately, our font descriptor,
`struct console\_font` does not contain `FONTDATAMAX`, and is part of the
UAPI, making it infeasible to modify it.
For user-provided fonts, the framebuffer layer resolves this issue by
reserving four extra words at the beginning of data buffers. Later,
whenever a function needs to access them, it simply uses the following
macros:
Recently we have gathered all the above macros to . Let us
do the same thing for built-in fonts, prepend four extra words (including
`FONTDATAMAX`) to their data buffers, so that subsystems can use these
macros for all fonts, no matter built-in or user-provided.
This patch depends on patch "fbdev, newport\_con: Move FONT\_EXTRA\_WORDS
macros into linux/font.h".

Simon reported an issue with the current scalar32_min_max_or() implementation.
That is, compared to the other 32 bit subreg tracking functions, the code in
scalar32_min_max_or() stands out that it's using the 64 bit registers instead
of 32 bit ones. This leads to bounds tracking issues, for example:

The bound tests on the map value force the upper unsigned bound to be 25769803777
in 64 bit (0b11000000000000000000000000000000001) and then lower one to be 1. By
using OR they are truncated and thus result in the range [1,1] for the 32 bit reg
tracker. This is incorrect given the only thing we know is that the value must be
positive and thus 2147483647 (0b1111111111111111111111111111111) at max for the
subregs. Fix it by using the {u,s}32_{min,max}_value vars instead. This also makes
sense, for example, for the case where we update dst_reg->s32_{min,max}_value in
the else branch we need to use the newly computed dst_reg->u32_{min,max}_value as
we know that these are positive. Previously, in the else branch the 64 bit values
of umin_value=1 and umax_value=32212254719 were used and latter got truncated to
be 1 as upper bound there. After the fix the subreg range is now correct:
