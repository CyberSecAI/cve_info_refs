Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27813

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an integer overflow that occurs when processing the length of WebSocket frames received via a WebSocket connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The core issue lies in how the `gorilla/websocket` library handles the declared length of incoming WebSocket frames.  An attacker can manipulate this length to cause an integer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By triggering the integer overflow, an attacker can cause the server to consume excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition and ultimately causing a denial of service.
- Bypassing Read Limits: The integer overflow allows attackers to bypass the intended read limits, further exacerbating the memory consumption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious WebSocket Frames: The attacker sends crafted WebSocket frames with specific length values designed to trigger the integer overflow on the receiving server.
- Network: The attack is delivered over the network through a websocket connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to establish a WebSocket connection with the vulnerable server.
- Ability to craft and send malicious WebSocket frames.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** `gorilla/websocket` versions <= 1.4.0.
- **Patched Versions:** `gorilla/websocket` version >= 1.4.1 fixes the vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade `gorilla/websocket` library to version 1.4.1 or higher. Dependency manifests should be updated to pin the fixed version.
- **Credit:** Max Justicz is credited for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
