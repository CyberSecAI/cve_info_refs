# Potential DoS Vector in gorilla/websocket <= v1.4.0

## Package

gomod

gorilla/websocket
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

⚠️ A potential denial-of-service (DoS) vector that can cause an integer overflow in the presence of malicious WebSocket frames was reported in gorilla/websocket versions <= v1.4.0. This could allow an attacker to consume excessive amounts of memory on the server by bypassing read limits, and potentially cause the server to go out-of-memory (OOM).

### Fix

👷 A fix (see [5b740c2](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/commit/5b740c29263eb386f33f265561c8262522f19d37)) adds checks against the remaining bytes on a connection, as well as a test to prevent regression.

> ❗ **We recommend users upgrade the version of gorilla/websocket in-use to >= [v1.4.1](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/releases/tag/v1.4.1)** and ensure any dependency manifests (`go.mod`, `Gopkg.toml`, etc.) pin to the fixed version.

### Credit

Credit to Max Justicz (<https://justi.cz/>) for discovering and reporting this, as well as providing a robust PoC and review.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

No known CVE

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : golang-websocket
Version        : 1.4.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-27813

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in golang-websocket, a Go package
implementing the WebSocket protocol connection. An attacker would use this flaw
to cause a denial of service attack on an HTTP Server allowing websocket
connections.

The following reverse-dependencies have been rebuilt against the new golang-
websocket version: hugo and gitlab-workhorse

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-websocket packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-websocket please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-websocket>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
