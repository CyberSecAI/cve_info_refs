Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-27650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) does not set the "Secure" flag for the session cookie in an HTTPS session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Lack of the "Secure" flag on session cookies. This flag is crucial for ensuring that the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS connections, protecting it from being intercepted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Man-in-the-middle attack:** Attackers can intercept the session cookie if the user's traffic is downgraded to HTTP. This allows attackers to potentially hijack the user's session.
* **Information disclosure:** With the hijacked session cookie, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the user's account and potentially access sensitive information.
* **Limited impact:** The impact is limited to low confidentiality, integrity, and availability compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network level:** The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers positioned in the network path between the user and the DSM server.
*   **Man-in-the-middle:** Attackers can leverage a man-in-the-middle position to intercept the HTTP traffic and obtain the session cookie.
*   **Downgrade attack:** Attackers may try to force a downgrade from HTTPS to HTTP to intercept the cookie as it is transmitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network proximity:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server.
* **Man-in-the-middle capability:** The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the HTTP traffic and obtain the session cookie.
* **User interaction:** The attack relies on the user interacting with the server through an HTTP session (either by a downgrade attack or by some other means that leads to HTTP communication). The UI component of the vector is a "User Required" component, which can be obtained by user interaction through redirection.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS base score of 5.8.
* The vulnerability is present in Synology DSM versions prior to 6.2.3-25426-2.
* The resolution is to update to Synology DSM version 6.2.3-25426-2 or later versions
* The vulnerability is present for users utilizing Synology products on an unsecure network, or on networks where an attacker could conduct a MITM.
