| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1899769#c0)  Todd Cullum    2020-11-20 00:06:07 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and newer. When handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be discreetly added via the URI when being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information disclosure. It has been confirmed that the code behind this issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.

Do not use mailto links at all 2. Always double-check in the user interface that there are no unwanted attachments before sending emails; especially when the email originates from clicking a mailto link.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1899769#c7)  Todd Cullum    2020-11-20 17:16:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Please see <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/> for more details.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1899769#c9)  Alexander Larsson    2021-01-28 16:13:37 UTC  ``` No acceptable patch upstream, the only one there is regresses features being used. And the available mitigation explained above seems pretty natural in general. Making this WONTFIX.   ``` |  |

# Attaching files with mailto:?attach=... parameter is considered dangerous

In `run_thunderbird()`, xdg-email greps for a proprietary `attach` parameter:
<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-utils/-/blob/master/scripts/xdg-email.in#L51>

This allows arbitrary websites with mailto links to add local files on disk into the Thunderbird's email composition dialog and should be removed: <https://twitter.com/i/status/1295357952480751616>

After Thunderbird removed this functionality years ago, I think xdg-email somewhat re-introduced it.
