Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `xdg-email` component of `xdg-utils`. Specifically, it's due to the way `xdg-email` handles `mailto:` URIs, allowing attachments to be discreetly added through the `attach` parameter within the URI when the email is being passed to Thunderbird.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion:** The primary weakness is the ability to include local files as attachments via the `mailto:` URI.
- **Lack of User Awareness:** The vulnerability is exacerbated because the attachment is added without any explicit user confirmation or visible indication in the email composition dialog.
- **Proprietary Parameter:** `xdg-email` uses a proprietary `attach` parameter which allows for this behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could craft a malicious `mailto:` URI containing the path to a sensitive local file. If the victim clicks this URI and sends the email without noticing the attachment, the sensitive file could be disclosed to the attacker or unintended recipient.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URI:** An attacker can distribute a specially crafted `mailto:` URI via various means, such as a website, email, or instant message.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to click the malicious URI, which triggers the email client and adds the attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a `mailto:` URI:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URI with the `attach` parameter pointing to a local file.
- **Victim interaction:** The attacker relies on the victim clicking on the malicious link.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any special access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in `xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1` and newer.
- The issue was initially reported for Thunderbird, but later found to be located in `xdg-email`.
- The vulnerability was not fixed due to it regressing features, and the recommendation is for users to be cautious when using mailto links and double check attachments.
