*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The YouTrack application was vulnerable to Blind SSRF.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially make requests to internal or external resources from the server hosting YouTrack. This could potentially expose sensitive information or allow further attacks if the targeted resources are vulnerable.
*  **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to send a crafted request that would trigger YouTrack to make a request to a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the YouTrack application. This could be from an internal or external network.
