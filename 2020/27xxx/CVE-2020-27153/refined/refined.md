  "CVE-2020-27153": {
    "description": "A double free flaw was discovered in the disconnect_cb() routine in the gattool in Bluez. A remote attacker can exploit this during service discovery to cause a denial of service, or potentially, execution of arbitrary code.",
    "affected_component": "bluez gatttool",
    "root_cause": "Double free in the `disconnect_cb()` function within `src/shared/att.c` when handling a redundant disconnect MGMT event during service discovery.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Double Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote attacker enticing a user to connect to a malicious GATT server/device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to set up a malicious GATT server and initiate a Bluetooth Low Energy connection.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs during service discovery, after a Bluetooth Low Energy connection has been established to a device. There is a small time window between the two calls to free() which could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution."
