Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27780:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw exists in Linux-PAM's handling of empty passwords for non-existent users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- When a user does not exist, PAM attempts to authenticate using the root account with an empty password.
- This results in successful authentication even when the intended user does not exist and the root account has an empty password.
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 1.5.0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful authentication bypass allows unauthorized access to the system.
- Confidentiality, integrity, and system availability are at risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker attempts to log in using a non-existent username on the system.
- If the root account has an empty password, the authentication will be successful.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to attempt authentication on a system with the vulnerable PAM version.
- The attacker must use a non-existing username, targeting systems with empty root passwords.
