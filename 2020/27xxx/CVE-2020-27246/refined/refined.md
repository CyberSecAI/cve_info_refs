The content is related to CVE-2020-27246.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the dynamic construction of SQL queries within the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page, where user-supplied input from the `immoComment` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user input being directly embedded in SQL queries. Specifically, the `immoComment` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful SQL injection attack can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the OpenClinic GA database. An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `/openclinic/main.do?Page=util/listImmoLabels.jsp` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They can then send a crafted HTTP POST request with the vulnerable parameter containing SQL injection payloads.
