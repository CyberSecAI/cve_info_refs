Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27413:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Mahavitaran Android application stores user passwords in cleartext within a shared preferences file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cleartext password storage:** Passwords are not encrypted or hashed, making them easily readable if the application's data is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account compromise:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's Mahavitaran account using the exposed password. This would allow the attacker to view personal information, pay bills, and potentially manage the user's electricity connections.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access via ADB shell:** An attacker with physical or remote access to the user's device can use the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) shell to navigate to the shared preferences directory and read the cleartext passwords.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Device access:** The attacker needs to have access to the user's Android device, either physically or through remote access tools.
*   **ADB knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to interact with the device.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable data is stored in `/data/data/com.msedcl.app/shared_prefs/pref_login_info.xml`.
*   The attacker can use `adb shell` to access the file.
*   The `cat pref_login_info.xml` command will reveal the password in cleartext.
