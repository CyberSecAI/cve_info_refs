Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `orderby` parameter in the `/api/v1/containers` API endpoint. The application directly incorporates the value of this parameter into a SQL query without proper escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `orderby` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the database queries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerable API endpoint does not call the `SQLUtil.sanitizeSortBy` method, which was designed to prevent SQL injection, leading to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by querying arbitrary tables and columns.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Potential System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary SQL commands, an attacker could potentially gain further access to the system (depending on the database permissions and configurations).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `orderby` parameter of a GET request to the `/api/v1/containers` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable dotCMS application to send HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/v1/containers` and the `orderby` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes screenshots demonstrating successful SQL injection attempts using `PG_SLEEP` to verify the vulnerability and `sqlmap` to extract data.
- The issue was identified and fixed in dotCMS versions 5.2.8.5, 5.3.8.5, and 20.10.1.
- The issue has been assigned the labels "Changelog: Documented", "Merged", "OKR : Security & Privacy", "QA : Approved", "QA : Passed Internal", "Release : 20.10.1", "Release : 5.2.8.5", "Release : 5.3.8.5", and "Type : Defect".
