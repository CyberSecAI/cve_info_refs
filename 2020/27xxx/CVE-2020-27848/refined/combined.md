### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v5.3.8.1...v20.10.1`

## Description

![@xiaozhicai](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19262732?u=a354627223c36740c56cdb8849c288a35e984860&v=4&size=48)[xiaozhicai](https://github.com/xiaozhicai)opened [on Oct 27, 2020](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/19500#issue-730028213)

**api : /api/v1/containers

Is vulnerable to SQL injection, by the parameter ‘orderby’ in url.**

[![截屏2020-09-3017 36 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246207-c0180680-1837-11eb-98fe-a4b4d711e1ba.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246207-c0180680-1837-11eb-98fe-a4b4d711e1ba.png)

[![截屏2020-09-3017 37 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246231-cb6b3200-1837-11eb-899f-9139329e2071.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246231-cb6b3200-1837-11eb-899f-9139329e2071.png)

As the pictures above shows,

orderby=title;%20SELECT%20PG\_SLEEP(2)%20-- , it took 2 seconds to receive the response from server

orderby=title;%20SELECT%20PG\_SLEEP(5)%20-- , it took 5 seconds to receive the response from server

Then I read through the code that I download from github(version 5.3.6.1), I found that the parameter will form SQL without sterilization (yeah, you have designed SQLUtil.sanitizeSortBy to prevent SQL injection, but in this case, the vulnerable API didn't call SQLUtil.sanitizeSortBy）

I tried to attack the project by sqlmap(a tool to detect and exploit SQL injection), and here is the result that sqlmap gave me:

tables that the project contains:

[![截屏2020-09-3018 08 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246387-30268c80-1838-11eb-90c0-4ae5a9430c2f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246387-30268c80-1838-11eb-90c0-4ae5a9430c2f.png)

columns that the table called ‘adminconfig’ contains:

[![截屏2020-09-3018 09 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246408-3caae500-1838-11eb-9e6c-55a58536c857.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19262732/97246408-3caae500-1838-11eb-9e6c-55a58536c857.png)

It’s obviously that there is SQL injection in your program.
