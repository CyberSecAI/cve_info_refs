# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Subject: fastd: DoS'able memory leak on invalid packets

```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=972521;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: fastd
Severity: important
Version: 17-4

fastd doesn't free receive buffers for invalid packets. This can lead to
memory exhaustion or (with v20) to an assert. From the release text:

    The new buffer management of fastd v20 revealed that received packets with an
    invalid type code were handled incorrectly, leaking the packet buffer. This lead
    to an assertion failure as soon as the buffer pool was empty, crashing fastd.

    Older versions of fastd are affected as well, but display a different behaviour:
    instead of crashing, the buffer leaks will manifest as a regular memory leak.
    This can still be used for Denial of Service attacks, so a patch for older
    versions will be provided, for the case that users can't or do not want to
    update to a newer version yet.

The fix can also be found inside the attached mail.

Kind regards,
	Sven

```
For fastd versions before v20, this was just a memory leak (which could
still be used for DoS, as it's remotely triggerable). With the new
buffer management of fastd v20, this will trigger an assertion failure
instead as soon as the buffer pool is empty.
```

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-495c14a23f
2020-11-03 01:29:14.893145
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fastd
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 21
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://github.com/NeoRaider/fastd/wiki>
Summary : Fast and secure tunneling daemon
Description :
fastd is a secure tunneling daemon with some unique features:

- Very small binary (about 100KB on OpenWRT in the default configuration,
including all dependencies besides libc)
- Exchangable crypto methods
- Transport over UDP for simple usage behind NAT
- Can run in 1:1 and 1:n scenarios
- There are no server and client roles defined by the protocol, this is just
defined by the usage.
- Only one instance of the daemon is needed on each host to create a full mesh
If no full mesh is established, a routing protocol is necessary to enable
hosts that are not connected directly to reach each other

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-13edfc3215
2020-11-03 00:57:50.584833
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fastd
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 21
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://github.com/NeoRaider/fastd/wiki>
Summary : Fast and secure tunneling daemon
Description :
fastd is a secure tunneling daemon with some unique features:

- Very small binary (about 100KB on OpenWRT in the default configuration,
including all dependencies besides libc)
- Exchangable crypto methods
- Transport over UDP for simple usage behind NAT
- Can run in 1:1 and 1:n scenarios
- There are no server and client roles defined by the protocol, this is just
defined by the usage.
- Only one instance of the daemon is needed on each host to create a full mesh
If no full mesh is established, a routing protocol is necessary to enable
hosts that are not connected directly to reach each other

# fastd v21[¶](#fastd-v21 "Permalink to this headline")

This is a critical bugfix release. All users of fastd v20 must update.

## Bugfixes[¶](#bugfixes "Permalink to this headline")

The new buffer management of fastd v20 revealed that received packets with an
invalid type code were handled incorrectly, leaking the packet buffer. This lead
to an assertion failure as soon as the buffer pool was empty, crashing fastd.

Older versions of fastd are affected as well, but display a different behaviour:
instead of crashing, the buffer leaks will manifest as a regular memory leak.
This can still be used for Denial of Service attacks, so a patch for older
versions will be provided, for the case that users can’t or do not want to
update to a newer version yet.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-01dc2bc62c
2020-11-03 01:20:46.180194
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fastd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 21
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://github.com/NeoRaider/fastd/wiki>
Summary : Fast and secure tunneling daemon
Description :
fastd is a secure tunneling daemon with some unique features:

- Very small binary (about 100KB on OpenWRT in the default configuration,
including all dependencies besides libc)
- Exchangable crypto methods
- Transport over UDP for simple usage behind NAT
- Can run in 1:1 and 1:n scenarios
- There are no server and client roles defined by the protocol, this is just
defined by the usage.
- Only one instance of the daemon is needed on each host to create a full mesh
If no full mesh is established, a routing protocol is necessary to enable
hosts that are not connected directly to reach each other
