    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of received packets with an invalid type code in the `receive.c` file of the fastd daemon.",
    "weaknesses": [

      "Assertion failure (in v20 and later) due to buffer pool exhaustion when memory isn't freed."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending packets with invalid type codes, leading to either a memory leak causing resource exhaustion or an assertion failure that crashes the daemon.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted network packets with invalid type codes to the fastd daemon over UDP."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
