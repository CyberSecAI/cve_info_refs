SSA-663999: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT2Go and
Teamcenter Visualization before V13.1.0.1

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

V1.1

SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.1.0.1 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple vulner-
abilities that could be triggered when the products read ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (BMP, TIFF, CGM,
TGA, PCT, HPG, PLT, RAS, PAR, ASM, DXF, DWG). If a user is tricked to opening of a malicious ﬁle with
the affected products, this could lead to application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution or data
extraction on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

Notes:

• Previous versions of this advisory incorrectly listed the following vulnerabilities as being ﬁxed in
V13.1.0.1: CVE-2020-26991, CVE-2020-26998, CVE-2020-26999, CVE-2020-27001 and CVE-
2020-27002. Those were ﬁxed in V13.1.0.2 and are therefore addressed in advisory SSA-695540
[0]

• The vulnerability CVE-2020-28383 was incorrectly listed in SSA-622830 [1] as being ﬁxed in

V13.1.0.0. This was ﬁxed in V13.1.0.1 and therefore added here

• The Open Design Alliance [2] recently disclosed an additional vulnerability (CVE-2021-31784) which

is also covered in this advisory

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

| CVSS SCORE | 2.5, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CGM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Siemens has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
