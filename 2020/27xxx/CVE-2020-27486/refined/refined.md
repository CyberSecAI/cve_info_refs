- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ConnectIQ program interpreter for Garmin Forerunner 235 trusts the string length provided in the data section of the PRG file, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unbounded string copy: The `strcpy_` function is used to copy the string data into the allocated buffer, without proper bounds checking, which can cause a buffer overflow if the provided string data is longer than the allocated space.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a ConnectIQ app store application to escape its restricted execution environment and perform unauthorized activities. This could include arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Maliciously crafted PRG file: An attacker can craft a PRG file with a string definition that specifies a small length, but provides a much longer string in the data section. This would trigger the overflow during the string copy operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Ability to create and install ConnectIQ applications on the target device: The attacker needs to be able to create and install a malicious application on a Garmin Forerunner 235. This could be achieved through the official ConnectIQ app store or other means.
