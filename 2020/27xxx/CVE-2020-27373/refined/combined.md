## FAQ

* ## What is World Accelerator?

   World Accelerator is the first ever Domain Accelerator and gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to develop a business based on prime [Internet real estate](https://www.world.com/domains/). Over the last ten years, the cost and time needed to bring exciting and disruptive businesses to market has dramatically compressed. However, building credibility with customers, partners and your brand still takes time. World Accelerator changes this paradigm, turning it upside down as companies can now start with a powerful existing brand on day one.
* ## Where is World Accelerator located?

   World Accelerator is a global platform. While we are based in midtown New York our teams and affiliated companies are headquartered all around the world. Please reach us via our [Contact Us](https://www.world.com/contact/) form.
* ## What do you look for in a World Accelerator applicant?

   We look for focus, passion, and a team‚Äôs knowledge of their market. We also look for agile development experience. You must be able to deploy value rapidly to take advantage of the growth you can see from a great brand. We want to understand what is disruptive about a team‚Äôs plan or what is their unique value proposition. We look to understand your go to market and growth strategy and revenue and margin models. We like to also go deep to understand a team‚Äôs KPI‚Äôs (Key Performance Indicators) that you will be targeting. Finally, of course the clincher is in making sure all these elements can leverage and benefit from one of the World Accelerator domain brands.
* ## How are deals on the domains structured?

   It is important that any structure reflects the effort and commitment by entrepreneurs and that there is alignment with all parties. As a development team you want control and ownership over the brands you are developing. The use of one of our domain brands takes on the form of a very attractive license to allow the entrepreneur time to use and build into the brand without burdening your growth. The brand is an enabler and will further help you accelerate your plans. As you build your business you can acquire the brand at a capped price in the future or some other payout structure. This is set upfront which means as you prove successful, you get the upside for your efforts. World gets some ownership in the venture which gives World upside. The whole program allows for the right alignment and all parties benefit from the use of the brand.
* ## I need Capital, how can World help?

   World invests in companies from time to time. We tend to invest capital to accelerate growth once a team has demonstrated product market fit. We have also participated in follow-on investments in portfolio companies as parts of larger rounds. However, that is just a small part of our funding contribution. Our team has over 50 years of combined experience raising capital from a range of sources. We are well acquainted with the community of angel investors and venture capitalists and know how to find financing through seed funding, strategic debt, M&A and IPO‚Äôs. World Accelerator also works closely with our team to ensure they have the right components and a successful plan to access capital as needed.

This blog is not about any bounty tricks moreover it‚Äôs based on the CVE I received this year on a product.

In our daily scenarios we have been using Bluetooth technology for connecting headphones, mouse, smartwatch, etc ‚Ä¶but have you ever thought of finding bugs on that device?

What if you can connect the device without pairing it with your phone and perform any particular action :D sounds interesting right üòâ

So let‚Äôs start and see how I controlled the device via my terminal.

Okay!! While performing any BLE attack you need few tools such as:

¬∑ CSR dongle 4.0 or 5.0 (depends on which Bluetooth version the device is working in my case it was 4.0)

¬∑ Android phone of course

¬∑ Device itself on which you want to attack

In the very first phase, we must do some recon to identify the address of BLE.

**Command-hcitool -i hci1 lescan**

Once we have gathered the address we can further move forward to connect the device using gatttool

**Command-gatttool -I -I hci1 -b <ble address>**

Now, to get information about service and characteristics

**Command-primary**

In the screenshot above information given is attribute group handle and uuid of specific device 1801 is used for general information like device name, appearance, etc.
