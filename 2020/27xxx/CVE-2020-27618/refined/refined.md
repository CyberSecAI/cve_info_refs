{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2020-27618",
  "description": "The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.",
  "root_cause": "The iconv function, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in certain IBM character sets, fails to advance the input state, leading to an infinite loop.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of invalid multi-byte input sequences.",
    "Lack of proper state management during character set conversion."
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to an infinite loop in applications using the iconv function.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Processing invalid multi-byte sequences using the iconv function with IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply specially crafted, invalid multi-byte input sequences to a vulnerable application that uses the iconv function with affected IBM character sets."
