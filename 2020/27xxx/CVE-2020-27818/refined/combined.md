Package        : pngcheck
Version        : 2.3.0-7+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-27818
Debian Bug     : 976350

A flaw was found in the check_chunk_name() function of pngcheck, a tool to
verify the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files. This flaw allows an attacker
who can pass a malicious file to be processed by pngcheck to cause a temporary
denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
2.3.0-7+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pngcheck packages.

For the detailed security status of pngcheck please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pngcheck>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-11-26 15:16:37 UTC  ``` A global buffer overflow was discovered in check_chunk_name function in pngcheck-2.4.0 via a crafted png file.  Reference:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1897485](show_bug.cgi?id=1897485)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c1)  Marian Rehak    2020-11-26 15:17:03 UTC  ``` Created pngcheck tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1902012](show_bug.cgi?id=1902012 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-27818 pngcheck: global buffer overflow was discovered in check_chunk_name function via crafted pngfile [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-26 17:33:53 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c4)  Todd Cullum    2020-11-30 19:01:28 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  When pngcheck is provided a crafted input file, it could cause a global-buffer-overflow -> out-of-bounds read, due to improper use of casts in the check_chunk_name() function of pngcheck-2.4.0/pngcheck.c. Red Hat Product Security has designated this as a Low severity issue because an attacker would likely need to social engineer a user or already have access to a victim system, and exploiting this flaw would likely only lead to temporary denial of service (application crash).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c5)  Todd Cullum    2020-11-30 19:03:19 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate this flaw, do not provide input files from untrusted sources to pngcheck.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1902011#c7)  Todd Cullum    2020-12-02 19:50:40 UTC  ``` External References:  F34/Rawhide: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-04d5e1ce26> F33:         <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-4349e95c4f> F32:         <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-23432b7b72> F31:         <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-27b168926a> EPEL8:       <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2020-6c93c61069> EPEL7:       <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2020-339db397ad>   ``` |  |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
