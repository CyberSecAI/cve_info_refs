- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `findSector` parameter within the `patientslist.do` page. Specifically, the `findSector` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sufficient sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability in the `findSector` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `patientslist.do` page including the malicious SQL payload in the `findSector` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
