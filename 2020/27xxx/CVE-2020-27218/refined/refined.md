Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0.RC0 through 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0 through 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha0 through 11.0.0.beta2 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to addition or modification of data.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is within Eclipse Jetty's handling of GZIP request body inflation when requests from different clients are multiplexed onto a single connection. If an attacker sends a request with a body that is received but not consumed by the application, a subsequent request on the same connection will have that body prepended.",
