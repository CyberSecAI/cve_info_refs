{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in Eclipse Jetty's handling of requests with multiple Accept headers containing a large number of quality (q) parameters, which leads to excessive CPU consumption during processing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU usage. The vulnerability lies in the QuotedQualityCSV parsing logic when processing multiple Accept headers with many 'q' parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the server becomes unresponsive due to high CPU usage.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with multiple Accept headers, each having a large number of quality parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges, and the attack can be performed remotely via network access."
