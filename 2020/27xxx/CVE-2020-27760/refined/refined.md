Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27760:

**Root Cause:**
- A division-by-zero error occurs within the `GammaImage()` function in `/MagickCore/enhance.c` of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Division by zero: The code does not properly check for a zero value before performing division.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The division-by-zero error leads to a crash or abnormal termination of the ImageMagick process, making the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted input file: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file that, when processed by ImageMagick, results in the division by zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious image file to ImageMagick for processing.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered based on the value of the `gamma` parameter used by the `GammaImage()` function.
- The fix involves using `PerceptibleReciprocal()` to prevent the division-by-zero.
- The issue is present in ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.
- Red Hat has marked this as "WONTFIX" for RHEL 5, 6 and 7, but has issued errata for EPEL 8 and Fedora.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when processing images using vulnerable versions of ImageMagick.
- Multiple other CVEs were fixed in the same Debian LTS advisory due to similar issues.
