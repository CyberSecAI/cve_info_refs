  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The RandomGameUnit extension failed to properly escape titles and options of games created using PictureGame, PollNY, and QuizGame extensions when displaying them, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored XSS",
      "Insufficient output sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious JavaScript code embedded within game titles or options is executed in the browsers of users viewing the content, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious game title or option (e.g., containing `<script>` tags) through the PictureGame, PollNY or QuizGame creation forms. When the RandomGameUnit extension displays this game title/option, it renders the unsanitized code, triggering the XSS.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create/edit game content using PictureGame, PollNY, or QuizGame extensions, and the system must have the RandomGameUnit extension enabled."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves applying `htmlspecialchars()` to all user-generated inputs from the database before displaying them through the RandomGameUnit extension."
