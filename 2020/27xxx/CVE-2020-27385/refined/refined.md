Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27385:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `FileEditor` of FlexDotnetCMS. It allows authenticated users to read and modify files from anywhere on the host system, bypassing intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `FileEditor` allows the use of directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the "Select File" input field, enabling access to files outside the intended upload directory.
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read and modify files at any location on the server's file system, given the correct paths or traversal paths. This bypasses intended access controls.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Since the web server process runs with elevated privileges, the attacker inherits these privileges when accessing files through the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files located anywhere on the server.
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify critical files which could lead to a compromise of the application or the server.
- **Full Server Compromise:** With the ability to read and modify system files, attackers can achieve complete control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct Path Input:** An attacker can provide the full path to a file on the host system in the `FileEditor`'s "Select File" input field.
- **Directory Traversal:** An attacker can use `../` sequences in the "Select File" input to navigate to other directories outside the intended web root and access files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log in to FlexDotnetCMS as an authenticated user.
- **Knowledge of Target Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the paths to the target files they wish to access or modify.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is described in detail in the blog post from vonahi.io.
- The blog post also includes a demo video demonstrating the directory traversal attack.
- FlexDotnetCMS version 1.5.8 fixed the vulnerability when full paths were specified in `FileEditor`, but it was still vulnerable to directory traversal. Version 1.5.11 addressed the directory traversal vulnerability as well.
- The access to the file system is done with elevated privileges inherited from the IIS server.
