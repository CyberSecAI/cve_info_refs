{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability in the parsing of DPA files in the DOPSoft application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited when the target opens a malicious DPA file or visits a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a crafted DPA file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DPA file or a malicious web page that causes a vulnerable parsing process to occur. User interaction is required (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page)."
