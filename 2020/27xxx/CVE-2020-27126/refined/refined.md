Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27126

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of user-supplied input to an Application Programming Interface (API) within Cisco Webex Meetings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive browser-based information from the system of a targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network (AV:N)
- The attacker convinces a targeted user to follow a crafted link. This link is designed to submit malicious input to the API used by Cisco Webex Meetings.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), as the user must click the malicious link.
- The vulnerability affects a changed scope (S:C) because the attack could impact other users of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no privileges (PR:N)
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker must craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload and successfully trick a user into clicking the link.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- Base Score: 6.1
- Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- The vector indicates the attack is performed over the network with low complexity, no required privileges, user interaction is required, the scope is changed, and the impact is low for confidentiality and integrity, and there is no impact on availability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the cloud-based Cisco Webex Meetings service.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
