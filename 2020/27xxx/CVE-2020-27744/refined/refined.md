Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-27744:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ftp_download` binary, specifically how it processes user-supplied input when interacting with the `popen()` function.
*   The `$host` variable, derived from user input, isn't validated before being passed to the external `HostToIP()` function in the `/usrlib/libscheddl.so` library. This lack of validation allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The primary weakness is that an attacker can inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the `$host` variable within the `/web/addons/jqueryFileTree.php` script.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script does not properly sanitize user-controlled input before passing it to the `HostToIP()` function.
*   **Unsafe use of `popen()`:** The `popen()` function executes the user-controlled input as a shell command, creating the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The injected commands are executed with root privileges, allowing the attacker complete control over the system.
*   **Backdoor Access:** Attackers could use this to maintain a persistent backdoor on the compromised device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Western Digital My Cloud NAS device, specifically by sending a crafted request to the `/web/addons/jqueryFileTree.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the My Cloud device's web interface.
*   **Low Level User Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited even by users with the lowest level of access to the NAS device.

**Summary of CVE-2020-27744:**

This CVE describes a remote command injection vulnerability in Western Digital My Cloud NAS devices. By manipulating user input within the `/web/addons/jqueryFileTree.php` script, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges due to unsanitized input passed to the `popen` function via a binary. This allows an attacker to gain full control of the device and potentially establish a persistent backdoor, even with minimal initial access.
