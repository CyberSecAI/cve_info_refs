Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Synology Router Manager (SRM) web interface not setting the `Secure` flag for the session cookie. This omission allows the cookie to be transmitted over insecure HTTP connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing `Secure` Flag:** The primary weakness is the absence of the `Secure` flag on the session cookie. This flag, when set, ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS connections.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of the `Secure` flag leads to potential information disclosure because the cookie can be intercepted in transit over HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker who successfully steals the session cookie can impersonate the legitimate user and gain unauthorized access to the router's web interface.
*   **Remote Access:** By obtaining the cookie, an attacker can achieve remote access to the router's configuration and functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker positioning themselves between the user and the router's web server.
*   **Interception of HTTP Traffic:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP traffic during a session with the web interface to steal the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the router (Man-in-the-Middle position).
*   **Passive Eavesdropping:** The attacker needs to be capable of passively eavesdropping on network traffic to capture the cookie if the user connects to the router over HTTP

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is exacerbated when combined with the issue described in TALOS-2020-1060, as that vulnerability can force the user's browser to provide the session cookie over an unencrypted HTTP connection through the QuickConnect feature.
*   The session cookie is named "id".
*   The web interface is accessible on ports 8000 (HTTP) and 8001 (HTTPS).
*   Even with “redirect HTTP to HTTPS” and “Enable HSTS” options enabled, the session cookie still lacks the secure flag.
*   The vulnerability is present in Synology SRM before version 1.2.4-8081.
*   Synology DSM 6.2.3 25426 was also confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.
