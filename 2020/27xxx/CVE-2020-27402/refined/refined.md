      "information": "The content from multiple sources provides detailed information regarding CVE-2020-27402. Here's a summary:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper access control in the Hindotech HK1 Box S905X3 TV Box. Specifically, there is a lack of authentication for debugging functions when connecting to the device via the serial port (UART) or through Android Debug Bridge (adb) as an unprivileged user. This lack of authentication allows unauthorized access to a shell.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   **Inadequate access controls:** The device allows unprivileged users to access debugging interfaces without authentication.\n*   **Executable root binaries:** The device includes `/system/xbin/su` (executable by all users) and `/sbin/su` (group executable), which can be used to gain root access from a shell.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\nA local attacker can escalate privileges to root, leading to:\n\n*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can run any code with root privileges.\n*   **Data theft:** Sensitive information can be accessed, including social networking account tokens, Wi-Fi passwords, cookies, saved passwords, user location data, message history, emails, and contacts.\n*   **Network sniffing:** The compromised device can be used to sniff other devices on the same network.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\nThe primary attack vectors are:\n\n*   **Local access via adb:** Connecting to the device via adb as an unprivileged user.\n*   **Physical access via UART:** Connecting to the device using the UART serial debugging port.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the device, either through adb or physical access to the UART port.\n*   **Unprivileged user:** The initial shell access is granted to an unprivileged user, which is then escalated.\n\n**Additional details:**\n\n*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sick.Codes.\n*   The vendor, Hindotech, did not respond to disclosure attempts, and their website was unavailable.\n*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.8 (or 9.3 in some reports), indicating high severity.\n*   Exploit code is publicly available.\n*   A mitigation involves changing the permissions of the su binaries to prevent unprivileged execution: `chmod 700 /system/xbin/su` and `chmod 700 /sbin/su`.\n\nThis content provides more specific technical details than the official CVE description, including the specific vulnerable binaries, the method for exploiting the vulnerability and the vendor's lack of response."
