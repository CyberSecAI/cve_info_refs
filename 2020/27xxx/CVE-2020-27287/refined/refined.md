Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XLS files within the DOPSoft application of Delta Industrial Automation's CNCSoft-B software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The lack of proper input validation allows for writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
  - Some advisories specify this as "write after the end of an allocated data structure", while others mention "write before the start of an allocated data structure"

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious XLS file: The attacker crafts a malicious XLS file that, when opened by the vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds write condition.
- Malicious page:  The target must visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User interaction is required: The victim needs to open the malicious XLS file or visit a malicious page.
- Local Access: Although the ZDI advisories mention "remote attackers" the attack vector is a local file, the CISA advisory also states "These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely."

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "kimiya" through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- Delta Industrial Automation has released an update to correct this vulnerability (v1.0.0.3).
- CISA recommends minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and utilizing secure methods like VPNs for remote access.

**Summary of the different ZDI advisories**
The advisories from ZDI (ZDI-21-044, ZDI-21-043, ZDI-21-041, ZDI-21-030, ZDI-21-031) describe the same vulnerability, but ZDI-21-041 and ZDI-21-031 describe a write before the start of an allocated data structure, while the others describe a write after the end.
