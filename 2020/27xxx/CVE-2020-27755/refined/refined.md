Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `SetImageExtent()` function within `/MagickCore/image.c` of ImageMagick.
- An incorrect image depth size is not properly handled. Specifically, the code that checks for the proper image depth doesn't reset the size if the size is invalid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Leak:** If an invalid image depth size is encountered, memory allocated may not be freed, leading to a memory leak.
- **Improper Error Handling**: The code doesn't reset the image depth to a valid size before throwing an exception, causing the leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted input file can trigger the memory leak. Repeated exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion and impact application reliability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input File:**  An attacker can create a malicious image file with an invalid image depth that, when processed by ImageMagick, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted image to an application that uses ImageMagick.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report mentions that the vulnerability is triggered in the `ResizeMagickMemory` function in `MagickCore/memory.c`. The patch fixes this vulnerability by resetting the depth to a proper size before throwing an exception. This means the memory leak occurs before exception handling.
- The fix involves ensuring that when an invalid size is encountered, the depth is reset to a valid one before an exception is thrown.
- Red Hat stated that this flaw is out of support scope for RHEL 5, 6, and 7. Inkscape is not affected in RHEL 8 as it no longer uses a bundled version of ImageMagick.
- The bug report also links to the upstream patch which addresses the issue.
- The provided information includes specific files and functions involved in the vulnerability.
