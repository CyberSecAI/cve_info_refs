Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-27918:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **use-after-free** issue present in the WebKit component. This means that the program attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of memory allocation and deallocation, leading to the use of freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means that an attacker could run malicious code on a vulnerable system.
*   **Unexpected application termination:** Some of the documents indicate that the vulnerability may lead to unexpected application termination.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Processing Maliciously Crafted Web Content:** The primary attack vector involves processing malicious web content. This could include visiting a malicious website, opening a malicious HTML file, or processing web content within an application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to interact with the malicious web content.
*   **No elevated privileges needed** an attacker can trigger this vulnerability by simply accessing the malicious content.

**Additional Information from the provided documents**
*  The vulnerability is present in multiple Apple products including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, Safari and iTunes for Windows.
*  The vulnerability affects WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Liu Long of Ant Security Light-Year Lab.
*  Some documents mention that there are reports that the vulnerability may have been actively exploited.

In summary, CVE-2020-27918 is a critical vulnerability due to the possibility of arbitrary code execution via a use-after-free error in WebKit when processing malicious web content.
