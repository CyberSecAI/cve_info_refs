{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web management interface contains multiple persistent XSS vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization and filtering.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Lack of output encoding"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into web pages, which could lead to user redirection to malicious sites or other malicious actions. The impact is considered low due to the limited scope in a real-world scenario.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Malicious HTML and JavaScript injection through web interface configuration parameters."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP POST requests with the malicious input to the affected endpoints. This could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities like CSRF if an administrator is logged in or by directly accessing the web interface if the attacker has access.",
     "affected_components": [
       "URLBlocking Settings",
       "SNMP Settings",
       "System Log Settings"
      ]
