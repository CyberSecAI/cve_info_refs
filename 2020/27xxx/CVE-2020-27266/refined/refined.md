- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The insulin pump and its mobile applications use client-side authentication, meaning that authentication checks are performed on the client side rather than the server side.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Client-side authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can bypass user authentication checks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Physically proximate attackers exploiting the vulnerability via Bluetooth Low Energy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be physically close to the device and able to communicate with it via Bluetooth Low Energy. They do not need to be authenticated.
