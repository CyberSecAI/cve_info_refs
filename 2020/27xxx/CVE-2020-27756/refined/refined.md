Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-27756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A division by zero error occurs in the `ParseMetaGeometry()` function within `MagickCore/geometry.c`.
- This division by zero is triggered during image height and width calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application availability can be impacted, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted input file processed by ImageMagick can trigger the division by zero.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to ImageMagick.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by using multiplication in addition to the function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` to prevent the division by zero.
- This vulnerability affects multiple versions of ImageMagick including those distributed with Debian and Fedora, however it is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,6 and 7.
- Inkscape is not affected in RHEL8 because it no longer uses a bundled version of ImageMagick.
