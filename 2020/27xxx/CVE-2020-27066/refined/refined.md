{
  "CVE-2020-27066": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipv6 xfrm subsystem.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is triggered due to a missing reference count when cloning a socket in the `sk_clone_lock()` function, leading to a use-after-free condition. Specifically, when a socket is cloned, the `sk_cgrp_data` is copied, but the group reference count is not always increased, causing the cgroup to be freed prematurely when the original socket's reference count goes to zero.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Missing reference count"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially escalate privileges by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the ipv6 xfrm subsystem, likely involving creating and cloning sockets, and manipulating network configurations.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the capability to create and manipulate sockets, which would likely require some level of privilege on the system. An attacker would also require knowledge of the vulnerable code paths and structures to trigger the use-after-free."
