{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The software constructs OS commands using externally influenced input without properly neutralizing special elements, leading to OS Command Injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker within the hospital network to remotely shut down or restart the workstation, potentially disrupting medical workflows.  Although diagnostic imaging from the X-ray system would still be available, the workstation would be unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted input to the affected software via the network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable workstation."
