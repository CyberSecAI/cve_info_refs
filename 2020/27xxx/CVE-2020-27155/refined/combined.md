# Prerequisites

* We are ready to publicly disclose this vulnerability or exploit according to our [responsible disclosure process](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/2430143/Security%2BDisclosure%2BPolicy).
* I have raised a CVE according to our [CVE process](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/8290305/Requesting%2Ba%2BCVE%2BID)
* I have written a descriptive issue title
* I have linked the original source of this report
* I have tagged the issue appropriately (area/security, kind/bug, tag/regression?)

## Description

If configured, the [WebSocket polling endpoint](https://octopus.com/docs/infrastructure/deployment-targets/windows-targets/polling-tentacles-web-sockets) can allow untrusted connections to be made under certain conditions. This endpoint is *not* enabled by default.

This issue does not affect Octopus Servers running on Linux, as the WebSocket polling endpoint is not available.

## Affected versions

**Octopus Server:** 3.11.13 to 2020.4.5

## Mitigation

Upgrade to the latest available supported version of Octopus Server.

## Workarounds

### Disable WebSocket endpoint

Use the following commands to disable the WebSocket endpoint.

```
.\Octopus.Server.exe service --instance <INSTANCE NAME> --stop
.\Octopus.Server.exe configure --instance <INSTANCE NAME> --commsListenWebSocket ""
.\Octopus.Server.exe service --instance <INSTANCE NAME> --start

```
