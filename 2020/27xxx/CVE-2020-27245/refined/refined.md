- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the dynamic construction of SQL queries within the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page. User-supplied parameters from the HTTP request are directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `immoBuyer` parameter of the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion, and potentially take control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page including malicious SQL code within the `immoBuyer` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to send a crafted HTTP request.
