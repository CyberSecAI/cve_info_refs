Subject: Xen Security Advisory 332 v4 (CVE-2020-27673) - Rogue guests can
 cause DoS of Dom0 via high frequency events

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332
                              version 4

     Rogue guests can cause DoS of Dom0 via high frequency events

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The handling of Xen events in the Linux kernel runs with interrupts
disabled in a loop until no further event is pending.

Whenever an event has been accepted by the kernel, another event can
come in via the same event channel.  This can result in the event
handling loop running for an extended time if new events are coming in
at a high rate.  In extreme cases this can lead to a complete hang of
the kernel, resulting in a DoS situation of the host when dom0 is
affected.

IMPACT
======

Malicious guests can hang the host by sending events to dom0 at a high
frequency.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems with a Linux dom0 are affected.

All Linux kernel versions are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall from Arm

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2020-0427

    Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can
    lead to a use-after-free after a device is renamed.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25645

    A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE
    encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is
    configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the
    GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the
    encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.246-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1177409#c9)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-10-20 14:01:19 UTC  ``` now public through <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-286.html>                      Xen Security Advisory XSA-286                               version 4       x86 PV guest INVLPG-like flushes may leave stale TLB entries  UPDATES IN VERSION 4 ====================  Warn about performance impact.  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  x86 PV guest kernels may use hypercalls with INVLPG-like behavior to invalidate TLB entries even after changes to non-leaf page tables.  Such changes to non-leaf page tables will, however, also render stale possible TLB entries created by Xen's internal use of linear page tables to process guest requests like update-va-mapping.  Invalidation of these TLB entries has been missing, allowing subsequent guest requests to change address mappings for one process to potentially modify memory meanwhile in use elsewhere.  IMPACT ======  Malicious x86 PV guest user mode may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the guest kernel.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All versions of Xen expose the vulnerability.  The vulnerability is exposed to x86 PV guests only.  x86 HVM/PVH guests as well as ARM ones are not vulnerable.  MITIGATION ==========  There is no known mitigation.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jann Horn of Google Project Zero.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that these patches are known to produce serious performence problems for at least some workloads.  Work is ongoing to improve the performance, and this XSA will be updated when new patches are available.  xsa286/*.patch           xen-unstable xsa286-4.14/*.patch      Xen 4.14.x xsa286-4.13/*.patch      Xen 4.13.x xsa286-4.12/*.patch      Xen 4.12.x xsa286-4.11/*.patch      Xen 4.11.x xsa286-4.10/*.patch      Xen 4.10.x ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1177409#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-27 20:16:14 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:3052-1: An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.

The patches supplied in XSA-286 version 4 were found to have a significant performance impact.  An alternative approach was developed and has now been committed to the relevant Xen branches.  The alternative approach is simpler and mitigates the performance problems.  At the time of writing the patches in XSA-286 v4 are believed to be correct and sound, but if we discover that this is not the case we will not issue a further update.  We recommend the use of the patches provided in the Xen git branches, which are the same as those attached in this version of the advisory.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the kernel-default package

SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1177411](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177411) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1184583](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1184583) [NEW]

| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1177414#c5)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-10-20 13:57:16 UTC  ``` now public through <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-347.html>        Xen Security Advisory XSA-347                               version 2                    unsafe AMD IOMMU page table updates  UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  AMD IOMMU page table entries are updated in a step by step manner, without regard to them being potentially in use by the IOMMU.  Therefore it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated entry.  Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates.  In both case the specific outcome heavily depends on how exactly the compiler translated the affected pieces of code.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable.  Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are vulnerable.  Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable.  Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Amazon and Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.  xsa347/xsa347-?.patch           xen-unstable xsa347/xsa347-4.14-?.patch      Xen 4.14 xsa347/xsa347-4.13-?.patch      Xen 4.13 xsa347/xsa347-4.12-?.patch      Xen 4.12 xsa347/xsa347-4.11-?.patch      Xen 4.10 - 4.11 ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1177414#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-27 20:16:31 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:3052-1: An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1177412](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177412) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1178658](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178658) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1183925](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183925) [NEW]

xen/events: defer eoi in case of excessive number of events

```
In case rogue guests are sending events at high frequency it might
happen that xen_evtchn_do_upcall() won't stop processing events in
dom0. As this is done in irq handling a crash might be the result.

In order to avoid that, delay further inter-domain events after some
time in xen_evtchn_do_upcall() by forcing eoi processing into a
worker on the same cpu, thus inhibiting new events coming in.

The time after which eoi processing is to be delayed is configurable
via a new module parameter "event_loop_timeout" which specifies the
maximum event loop time in jiffies (default: 2, the value was chosen
after some tests showing that a value of 2 was the lowest with an
only slight drop of dom0 network throughput while multiple guests
performed an event storm).

How long eoi processing will be delayed can be specified via another
parameter "event_eoi_delay" (again in jiffies, default 10, again the
value was chosen after testing with different delay values).

This is part of XSA-332.

xen/events: defer eoi in case of excessive number of eventsIn case rogue guests are sending events at high frequency it might
happen that xen\_evtchn\_do\_upcall() won't stop processing events in
dom0. As this is done in irq handling a crash might be the result.
In order to avoid that, delay further inter-domain events after some
time in xen\_evtchn\_do\_upcall() by forcing eoi processing into a
worker on the same cpu, thus inhibiting new events coming in.
The time after which eoi processing is to be delayed is configurable
via a new module parameter "event\_loop\_timeout" which specifies the
maximum event loop time in jiffies (default: 2, the value was chosen
after some tests showing that a value of 2 was the lowest with an
only slight drop of dom0 network throughput while multiple guests
performed an event storm).
How long eoi processing will be delayed can be specified via another
parameter "event\_eoi\_delay" (again in jiffies, default 10, again the
value was chosen after testing with different delay values).
This is part of XSA-332.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team on the xen package

This issue likely only affects the XEN hypervisor itself, unless otherwise stated. The userland utilities in -tools and libraries in -libs are shipped together with the xen hypervisor as they are built from one source and do not contain hypervisor specific fixes.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [1177413](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177413) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [1183925](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183925) [NEW]

| [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1177412#c6)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-10-20 13:59:44 UTC  ``` now public through <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-345.html>                      Xen Security Advisory XSA-345                               version 3                  x86: Race condition in Xen mapping code  UPDATES IN VERSION 3 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  The Xen code handling the updating of the hypervisor's own pagetables tries to use 2MiB and 1GiB superpages as much as possible to maximize TLB efficiency.  Some of the operations for checking and coalescing superpages take non-negligible amount of time; to avoid potential lock contention, this code also tries to avoid holding locks for the entire operation.  Unfortunately, several potential race conditions were not considered; precisely-timed guest actions could potentially lead to the code writing to a page which has been freed (and thus potentially already reused).  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest can cause a host denial-of-service.  Data corruption or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Versions of Xen from at least 3.2 onward are affected.  Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.  Guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they have passed through hardware devices.  Guests without passthrough configured cannot exploit the vulnerability.  Furthermore, HVM and PVH guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they are running in shadow mode, and only when running on VT-x capable hardware (as opposed to SVM).  This is believed to be Intel, Centaur and Shanghai CPUs.  MITIGATION ==========  Running all guests in HVM or PVH mode, in each case with HAP enabled, prevent those guests from exploiting the vulnerability.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Hongyan Xia of Amazon.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.  Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.  xsa345/*.patch           xen-unstable xsa345-4.14/*.patch      Xen 4.14.x xsa345-4.13/*.patch      Xen 4.12.x, Xen 4.13.x xsa345-4.11/*.patch      Xen 4.11.x xsa345-4.10/*.patch      Xen 4.10.x ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1177412#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-27 20:16:20 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:3052-1: An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27672 / XSA-345
                               version 5

                x86: Race condition in Xen mapping code

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

Fix some version tags.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Xen code handling the updating of the hypervisor's own pagetables
tries to use 2MiB and 1GiB superpages as much as possible to maximize
TLB efficiency.  Some of the operations for checking and coalescing
superpages take non-negligible amount of time; to avoid potential lock
contention, this code also tries to avoid holding locks for the entire
operation.

Unfortunately, several potential race conditions were not considered;
precisely-timed guest actions could potentially lead to the code
writing to a page which has been freed (and thus potentially already
reused).

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can cause a host denial-of-service.  Data corruption
or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Versions of Xen from at least 3.2 onward are affected.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they have passed through
hardware devices.  Guests without passthrough configured cannot
exploit the vulnerability.

Furthermore, HVM and PVH guests can only exercise the vulnerability if
they are running in shadow mode, and only when running on VT-x capable
hardware (as opposed to SVM).  This is believed to be Intel, Centaur
and Shanghai CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

Running all guests in HVM or PVH mode, in each case with HAP enabled,
prevent those guests from exploiting the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Hongyan Xia of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

| [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1177413#c5)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-10-20 13:58:45 UTC  ``` now public through <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-346.html>                      Xen Security Advisory XSA-346                               version 2                    undue deferral of IOMMU TLB flushes  UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  To efficiently change the physical to machine address mappings of a larger range of addresses for fully virtualized guests, Xen contains an optimization to coalesce per-page IOMMU TLB flushes into a single, wider flush after all adjustments have been made.  While this is fine to do for newly introduced page mappings, the possible removal of pages from such guests during this operation should not be "optimized" in the same way.  This is because the (typically) final reference of such pages is dropped before the coalesced flush, and hence the pages may have been put to a different use even though DMA initiated by their original owner mightstill be in progress.  IMPACT ======  A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.1 and earlier are not vulnerable.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests can leverage the vulnerability.  Arm guests as well as x86 PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.  Only x86 HVM and PVH guests configured to not share IOMMU and CPU page tables can leverage the vulnerability.  Sharing these page tables is the default on capable Intel (VT-d) hardware.  On AMD hardware sharing is not possible.  On Intel (VT-d) hardware sharing may also not be possible, depending on hardware properties.  Whether it is possible can be seen from the presence (or absence) of "iommu_hap_pt_share" on the "virt_caps" line of "xl info" output.  Guests run in shadow mode can leverage the vulnerability.  MITIGATION ==========  Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid the vulnerability.  On systems permitting page table sharing, not suppressing use of the functionality will allow to avoid the vulnerability. This means guests should not be run in * shadow mode, i.e. hardware needs to be HAP (Hardware Assisted Paging)   capable, there should not be "hap=0" in the guest's xl configuration   file, and there should not be "hap=0" or equivalent on Xen's command   line, * non-shared page table mode, i.e. hardware needs to be capable of   sharing, there should not be "passthrough=sync_pt" in the guest's xl   configuration file, and there should not be "iommu=no-sharept" or   equivalent on Xen's command line.  CREDITS =======  This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.

Debian Bug     : 949863 968623 971058

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-19039

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    assertion failure (WARN).  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) if the panic_on_warn kernel parameter is set.

CVE-2019-19377

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19770

    The syzbot tool discovered a race condition in the block I/O
    tracer (blktrace) that could lead to a system crash.  Since
    blktrace can only be controlled by privileged users, the security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    out-of-bounds write.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0423

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could result in a use-after-free.  On systems using this driver, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28941

    Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Speakup screen
    reader subsystem.  Speakup assumed that it would only be bound to
    one terminal (tty) device at a time, but did not enforce this.  A
    local user could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.160-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.
