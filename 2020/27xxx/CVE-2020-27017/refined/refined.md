  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web service accepts requests in the form of XML documents. The XML parser used is not configured correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity Processing (XXE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated administrator can read arbitrary local files through XXE. An attacker can exfiltrate local files through CSRF.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can send a crafted XML request to the web service that includes external entity references.",

    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into accessing an attacker-controlled web page. The attacker can then leverage the CSRF vulnerability combined with the XXE vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive files."
