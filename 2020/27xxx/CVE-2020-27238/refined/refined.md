The provided content is related to CVE-2020-27238.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization of the `code` parameter in the `getAssets.jsp` page. This parameter is directly used in constructing a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and underlying data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/openclinic/assets/ajax/asset/getAssets.jsp` endpoint. The `code` parameter in the query string is used to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
