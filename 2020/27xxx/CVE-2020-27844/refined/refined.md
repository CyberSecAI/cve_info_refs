Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability CVE-2020-27844:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - All sources explicitly mention "CVE-2020-27844" and describe it as a heap-based buffer overflow in the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function within the `openjp2/t2.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
   - It occurs specifically in the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function within `openjp2/t2.c`.
   - The overflow is triggered by crafted input that is processed by the OpenJPEG encoder.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** Writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption and unexpected behavior.
   - **Out-of-Bounds Write:** Specifically, the vulnerability involves writing data outside the designated memory region during encoding.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Memory Corruption:** Overwriting memory in the heap.
   - **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  As stated in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry, the vulnerability poses a threat to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability. This can result in:
      - **Confidentiality:** Potential exposure of sensitive information stored in memory.
      - **Integrity:** Modification of program data or execution flow.
      - **Availability:**  Possible crashes, denial-of-service, or even arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Crafted Input:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted input file provided to the OpenJPEG encoder.
   -  The specific format or structure of the crafted input is not detailed in the provided information, but it would be designed to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to supply crafted input:** An attacker must have the means to provide the malicious input to a vulnerable application using the openjpeg library.
   - **No authentication required:**  The Oracle Critical Patch Update indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning that it can be triggered over a network without needing user credentials. This suggests that the attacker need not be local to the affected system.

**Additional Information from the Sources:**
   - **Gentoo:** The Gentoo advisory highlights that multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenJPEG, and the worst case could allow for arbitrary code execution. It lists versions before 2.4.0 and 1.5.2-r1 as affected, and recommends upgrading to 2.4.0 or higher. It also notes that the vulnerability is "exploitable remotely."
   - **Red Hat Bugzilla:**
       -  A fix for the vulnerability is included in `openjpeg` version 2.4.0.
       -  The bug was tracked across different versions/builds (e.g., epel-7, fedora-all, mingw-openjpeg2).
       - Mitigation can be achieved by not processing untrusted input or encoding data with openjpeg.
   - **Oracle:** The Oracle advisories mention the vulnerability in the context of OpenJPEG used by various Oracle products including their database and Fusion middleware. They emphasize the need to apply the relevant patches. Some of the products listed may be affected by this vulnerability through their use of OpenJPEG.
   - **Debian:** Debian LTS advisory noted that OpenJPEG 2 had various overflow errors and listed CVE-2020-27844, along with CVE-2020-27814 CVE-2020-27823 CVE-2020-27824, CVE-2020-27841 and CVE-2020-27845

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-27844 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `opj_t2_encode_packet` function of the OpenJPEG library. It can be triggered by providing crafted input to the encoder, potentially resulting in memory corruption, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution. Affected software should be updated to a version of openjpeg where the vulnerability has been addressed.
