Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27862:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization of the "path" request parameter in the `dhttpd` service. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject commands through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection vulnerability in the `dhttpd` service.
- Insufficient input validation/sanitization of the "path" request parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on affected D-Link routers.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server (dhttpd).

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- The `dhttpd` service listens on TCP port 8008 by default, providing an attack entry point.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to the web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious "path" parameter to the dhttpd service.

**Affected Products:**
- (non-US) D-Link DSL-2888A Hardware Revision T
- (non-US) D-Link DVA-2800 Hardware Revision T
- Firmware version v3.20_AU

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists within the `dhttpd` service.
- The `libstarter.so` binary is also affected.
- Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported the vulnerability.
- D-Link released firmware updates to address this issue.
- The `dhttpd` service does not properly validate user-supplied strings before using them to execute system calls.
