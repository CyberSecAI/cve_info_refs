  "CVE-2020-27670": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x allowing x86 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (data corruption), cause a data leak, or possibly gain privileges because an AMD IOMMU page-table entry can be half-updated.",
    "affected_systems": "All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable. Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are vulnerable. Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable. Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability": "AMD IOMMU page table entries are updated in a step by step manner, without regard to them being potentially in use by the IOMMU. Therefore it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated entry. Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates.",
    "impact": "A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data leaks. Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege escalation, cannot be ruled out.",
    "attack_vector": "x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can leverage the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest"
