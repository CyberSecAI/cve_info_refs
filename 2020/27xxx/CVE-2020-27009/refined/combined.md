GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

APOGEE PXC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the APOGEE Automation System.

TALON TC Modular and Compact Series devices are high-performance Direct Digital Control (DDC)
devices and an integral part of the TALON Automation System.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15795

The DNS domain name label parsing functionality does not properly validate the names in DNS-
responses. The parsing of malformed responses could result in a write past the end of an allocated
structure. An attacker with a privileged position in the network could leverage this vulnerability to
execute code in the context of the current process or cause a denial-of-service condition.
