The vulnerability lies in the DNS domain name record decompression functionality within the Nucleus RTOS. It does not properly validate pointer offset values during the parsing of DNS responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of pointer offset values.
- Out-of-bounds write due to malformed DNS responses during decompression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected process.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitation requires a privileged position within the network.
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing malformed DNS responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a privileged position in the network to inject or manipulate DNS responses.
- No user interaction is required.
- Low attack complexity

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the DNS client of Nucleus NET.
- This is one of several vulnerabilities known as "NAME:WRECK".
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-823: Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset.
