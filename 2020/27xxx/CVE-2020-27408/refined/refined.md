Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls in the `ResetUserInfo.php` file of the openSIS application. This file allows an unauthenticated user to change the password of any user in the system, provided they know the `user_id` and `profile_id` values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Access Controls:** The password change functionality in `ResetUserInfo.php` does not enforce any authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized password changes.
*  **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The use of `user_id` and `profile_id` directly in the request without proper authorization checks.
*   **SQL Injection (Potential):**  Although not the primary focus, the code directly inserts user-supplied data into the SQL query without using prepared statements, making it potentially vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is mentioned but not the core focus of the report.
*   **Ineffective Obfuscation:** The "fix" implemented by the developers consisted of obfuscating the `user_id` and `profile_id` values using a simple remapping algorithm, which does not address the root cause of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Password Changes:** Attackers can change the password of any user in the system, potentially locking legitimate users out of their accounts.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** By gaining access to administrator accounts, attackers could potentially gain full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the `ResetUserInfo.php` file with the `user_info`, `new_pass` and `ver_pass` parameters.
*   **Brute-forcing:** The `user_id` and `profile_id` values can be brute-forced, as they are usually small integers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable file:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `ResetUserInfo.php` file.
*   **No authentication required:** No prior authentication is needed for exploiting the issue.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content also describes a failed attempt to fix the vulnerability, which actually introduced a **remote code execution vulnerability** due to the insecure use of the `exec` function and arbitrary PHP function calls via `AuthCryp.php`. This was later removed, but highlights the lack of secure coding practices.
*   The report emphasizes that the implemented "fix" was just obfuscation and not a real security measure.
*   The recommendation is to block access to the `ResetUserInfo.php` file as a temporary countermeasure until a proper fix is implemented.
