November 21,  2019

Attackers are able  to allocate significant amount of memory and processor time. So the availability of a service may be disturbed. This kind of attack is called denial of service (DoS). Therefore, this vulnerability is security-critical, if any security relevant process depends on remote availability.

November 21,  2019

This vulnerability may be used to perform a remote denial of service attack. The goal of a denial of service attack is to disturb the availability of a remote service or server, e.g. any access axTLS library. Hence, this vulnerability is security-critical, if any security relevant process depends on remote availability.

Variant of Satori/Mirai detected attacking public available ADB shells

10 July 2018

On the 10th of July at 23:30 UTC we noticed an increased traffic on our blackhole monitoring on TCP port 5555. Upon further analyzation, we saw a big chunk of this traffic coming from China, USA and the Dominican Republic. In total we gathered 246.434 packets from 68.361 unique IPs. Based on the packet details we gathered, we can assume that the packets were generated by a lot of different devices. In addition, the traffic behavior on port 555 matches the typicall scan behavior of botnets.

Kaltura Video Platform - Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution (and XSS)

12 Sep 2017

During an interal pentest several critical vulnerabilities could be identified in the latest version of Kaltura Community and Enterprise. The vulnerabilities were fixed in the latest release 13.2.0.
A proof of concept exploit may be released later, giving time for users to patch.

By misuse of several processor bugs it is possible to break up the separation between the kernel and user space.

## Deutsche Telekom CERT Assessment

On Intel CPU driven platforms, it is possible for normal user programs to gather information about protected kernel memory areas (“Meltdown attack”, CVE-2017-5754) [1] [2].  This results in an information leakage between kernel and user space.

This vulnerability affects every Intel CPU produced in the past decade (CPUs since 1995 except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms). The in [3] listed ARM cores are also affected by this vulnerability.

A further issue is described in the “Spectre attack” (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715). Spectre allows a user-mode application to extract information from other processes or VMs to access memory of other VMs. This vulnerability affects all listed Intel CPUs, as well as AMD’s Ryzen, FX and Pro families and several ARM Cortex cores listed in [3].

Official disclosure for Spectre and Meltdown took place on 2018-01-04 [10].

To exploit both vulnerabilities an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

Thus, up to now network components like routers, switches, firewalls, mobiles or CPEs don’t provide enough attack surface for exploitation even if they are affected. On most network components it is very difficult to run attacker crafted code because they’ve never been designed to run custom code.

## Recommendations

* Apply patches as soon as they are available from the respective supplier
  (for Microsoft desktop systems check availability with AV vendors [13])
* Top priority should be patching of (see timeline below)
  o   hypervisors of cloud systems
  o   operating systems of desktop clients and virtual/remote desktop systems
  o   operating systems of hosting platforms
* On XEN hypervisors:
  o   Enable “supervisor mode execute protection” if possible
  o   Evaluate if XEN VMs can be run in HVM or PVM mode (only PV hosting hypervisors are affected)
* For network components
  o   Even if an attack is unlikely ask your vendor if your device is vulnerable and needs patching

**Patch Prioritization**

In general high priority patching is advised for every machine which runs untrusted code from third parties. On shared and exclusive private clouds there is less risk because these platforms are dedicated to trusted customers. On all other servers it is unlikely that an attacker is able to run arbitrary code. Patch your system based on local patch cycles.

Due to the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that smartphones get exploited.

**Patch Availability**

* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, 10 [5]
  o   McAfee is now patch compatible [12]
  o   Further AV vendors can be found in [13]
  o   A registry key has to be set. Without the key the client doesn’t fetch the update. See [5].
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Server Version 1709 Attention: The mitigation has to be enabled via registry [6]
* Mac OS X 10.13.1 (10.13.2 isn’t vulnerable)
* Several Suse Linux and RHEL distributions [7] [8]
* VMware ESXi 5.5 to 6.5, Workstation 12.X and 14.X, Fusion 8.X [9]
* Android (patchlevel 2018-01-05)
* iOS (patchlevel 11.2)

Linux Kernel patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-09.

IBM AIX patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-12 [11].

There is no announcement for a SOLARIS patch, we are in touch with Oracle.

New critical denial of service vulnerability
in the SQLCipher SQL command processing
(CVE-2020-27207)
by Robert Hörr (e-mail: robert.hoerr@t-systems.com)
(Penetration Tester of the Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH)

A new critical denial of service vulnerability (Use CVE-2020-27207) in the SQLCipher
SQL  command  processing  of  the  master  branch  (https://github.com/sqlcipher)  was
discovered  with  a  self-developed  SQLCipher-FAST (Fast  Automated  Software
Testing) framework. The versions 4.x.x include the vulnerability, too. The vulnerability
forces the database application to read some unexpected RAM data, which leads to
an undefined database behavior. The vulnerability was fixed in the version 4.4.1.

What is the SQLCipher library?
The company Zetetic provides several security frameworks. One of them is the open
source  SQLCipher  library.  It  is  an  extension  for  the  open  source  SQLite  database
providing complete  database  encryption.  Several  companies
like  Samsung,
Motorola and  SAP  are  using  this library.  According  to  Zetetic,  "SQLCipher is widely
used, protecting data for thousands of apps on hundreds of millions of devices[...] ."
(https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/)

How is the SQLCipher library tested?
The code size of SQLite and SQLCipher library is roughly 250,000 lines of code. It is
hardly  possible  to  check  all  code  paths  by  a  manual  source  code  review.  Hence,
dynamic automated machine testing must be performed. An efficient way to perform
this kind of testing is the code coverage fuzzing approach. For that, the SQLCipher-
FAST framework  was  developed.  This  framework  unites  the  strengths  of  several
fuzzing tools and detects issues like buffer overflows.

Which issue was discovered?
The  SQLCipher-FAST  framework  detects  several  issues  in  the  SQL  command
processing.  One  of  the  issues  is  a  heap-use-after-free.  This  issue  occurs if  the
following  specially  crafted  SQL  command  sequence  is  executed  in  the  API  function
sqlite3_exec(...):

This  sequence  includes  the  string  "cipher_default_plaintext_header_size"  which  is
processed in the following source code parts of the file sqlite3.c:

function: sqlcipher_codec_pragma (...) {
if( sqlite3StrICmp(zLeft,")==0 ) {
  if( zRight ) {
     sqlcipher_set_default_plaintext_header_size(atoi(zRight));
  } else {
     char *size =
sqlite3_mprintf("%d", sqlcipher_get_default_plaintext_header_size());
     codec_vdbe_return_string(pParse, "cipher_default_plaintext_header_size",
size, P4_DYNAMIC);
     sqlite3_free(size);
}...}...}

function: sqlite3Strlen30(const char *z) {

}

The  pointer  size  gets  an  address  of  a  dynamically  allocated  memory  area.  In  the
function codec_vdbe_return_string(...) the pointer size is copied and the pointer size is
freed  by  the  function  execution sqlite3_free(size). Later  the  address  of  the  copied
pointer is read in the function strlen(z) of the function sqlite3Strlen30(...) which leads
to  an  undefined  database  behavior.  At  the  end  of  the  program the  function
freeP4(...) frees the copied pointer.

How is the discovered issue exploitable?
Exploiting  this issue  can  result  in  a  remote denial  of  service  attack.  For example,  a
SQL injection can be used to execute the specially crafted SQL command sequence.
After that, some unexpected RAM data is read that leads to an undefined database
behavior.
