- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper file handling within the Apple TV app for Fire OS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The app is vulnerable to script modification due to insufficient file handling practices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with file system access can modify the scripts used by the application. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: Requires file system access to the device where the Apple TV app is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the file system of the Fire OS device where the Apple TV app is installed.
