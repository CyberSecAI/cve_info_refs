- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `PatientUID` parameter in the `quickFile.jsp` page of OpenClinic GA is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of input sanitization/filtering. The application directly uses user-supplied input to construct SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89) vulnerability exists in the `quickFile.jsp` page. Specifically, the `PatientUID` parameter is directly embedded into an SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to read sensitive data, modify data, or perform other malicious actions on the database. The report mentions that the impact includes 'low' Confidentiality and Integrity impact, but no impact on Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is over the network. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/openclinic/popup.jsp?Page=statistics/quickFile.jsp` endpoint, including a malicious SQL injection payload in the `PatientUID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated. They also need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
