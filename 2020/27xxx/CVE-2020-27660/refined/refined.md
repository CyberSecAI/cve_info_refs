Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `request.cgi` script, specifically when handling the `domain` parameter. The provided domain is directly inserted into an SQL query without escaping, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the SQL injection vulnerability. The `domain` parameter from the HTTP GET request is incorporated into an SQL query string without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- The `libsynosafeaccesslog.so` library's `syno::safeaccess::insert` function builds an SQL query by embedding the `domain` parameter directly without escaping it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying SQLite database.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Because the `httpd` server runs as root, successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the router as root user.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can modify database contents, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or changing application behavior, as demonstrated by modifying the `fbsharing.db` database to expose internal directories.
- **Session Hijacking:** By combining the SQL injection with a separate XSS vulnerability, an attacker can steal the session cookie of the web interface, further compromising the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `/cgi/request.cgi` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `domain` parameter in the request to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Network Proximity:** The attack can be performed by a remote attacker with network access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Synology router.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The Talos report includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how an attacker can use the SQL injection to modify the profile name in another database, then trigger an XSS vulnerability by browsing the SafeAccess logs or profile page.
- The github content shows a detailed step-by-step guide on how to exploit both vulnerabilities, how to modify an admin user password and how to enable SSH.
-  The attacker can also gain access to shared folders using the SQL injection and a subsequent file download.
