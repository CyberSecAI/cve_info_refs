  "cve": "CVE-2020-27824",
  "description": "Global buffer overflow on irreversible conversion when too many decomposition levels are specified.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "openjpeg v2.3.1 and prior"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes()` function within OpenJPEG's encoder. When an excessive number of decomposition levels are provided, the function performs an out-of-bounds read due to a global buffer overflow.",
  "vulnerability": "Global buffer overflow",
  "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying crafted input with too many decomposition levels, potentially leading to denial of service or other undefined behavior due to memory corruption.",
  "attack_vector": "By providing a malformed JPEG 2000 image with too many decomposition levels.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed JPEG 2000 image to an application using the vulnerable openjpeg library.",
   "references": [
