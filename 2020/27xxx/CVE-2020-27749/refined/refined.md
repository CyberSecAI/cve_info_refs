  "CVE-2020-27749": {
    "description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `grub_parser_split_cmdline` function within grub2. This function expands variable names present in the command line into their corresponding variable contents, using a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage, without sufficient bounds checking. If a command line references a variable with a large enough payload, it's possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame, and gain control of execution, potentially circumventing Secure Boot protections.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking in `grub_parser_split_cmdline` when expanding variables into a stack buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Stack corruption, arbitrary code execution, circumvention of Secure Boot protections, potentially leading to data confidentiality and integrity loss, and system availability issues (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted GRUB command line with an overly large variable payload"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to influence the GRUB command line, which might involve local access or potentially network access, depending on the specific environment (e.g., through a network boot server or by modifying GRUB configuration)."
