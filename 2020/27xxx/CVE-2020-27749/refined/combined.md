Variable names present are expanded in the supplied command line into their corresponding variable contents, using a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage, without sufficient bounds checking. If the function is called with a command line that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it is possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control execution which could also circumvent Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2021-03-03 01:02:04 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

# GRUB: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202104-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GRUB, the worst might
allow for circumvention of UEFI Secure Boot.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/grub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.06\_rc1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.06\_rc1** |

### Background

GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader used by most Linux systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GRUB. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GRUB users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/grub-2.06_rc1"

```

After upgrading, make sure to run the grub-install command with options
appropriate for your system. See the GRUB Quick Start guide in the
references below for examples. Your system will be vulnerable until this
action is performed.
