Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "File Vault" feature in Quick Heal Total Security, which is intended to store files securely with password protection, has a password field that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. There are no apparent restrictions on the number of incorrect password attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Brute-Force Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility of the File Vault password field to brute-force attacks. This lack of rate-limiting or account lockout allows an attacker to repeatedly attempt password combinations until the correct one is found.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Files:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the files stored in the File Vault.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where Quick Heal Total Security is installed.
- **Brute Force:** The attacker needs to use a brute-force technique to guess the vault's password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Admin Rights:** The attacker needs local admin rights on the system to access the "File Vault" feature.
- **Ability to Execute Brute-Force Attacks:** The attacker must have the tools and capability to perform automated password attempts (brute force).
