Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27208:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `www.aisec.fraunhofer.de_9735de12_20250119_114946.html` explicitly mentions that the paper "Security and Trust in Open Source Security Tokens" identified vulnerabilities in SoloKeys Solo & Somu and Nitrokey FIDO2 tokens, and that these vulnerabilities are tracked under CVE-2020-27208. Thus, the content is **RELATED** to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is a weakness in the hardware security features of the microcontrollers used in SoloKeys Solo & Somu and Nitrokey FIDO2. Specifically, the content mentions "circumventing the read-out protection" of these devices.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Fault Injection Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the read-out protection mechanism, which is intended to protect the firmware from being extracted. This is achieved using fault injection techniques.
    *   The content states "we were able to circumvent the read-out protection of the STM32L4 and the nRF52840 microcontroller". Although the CVE is associated with the SoloKeys products, the vulnerability relies on exploiting weaknesses in the used microcontrollers.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Firmware Extraction:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract the protected firmware from the security token.
    *   **Compromise of Secrets:** Extracted firmware can expose cryptographic keys, algorithms, and other sensitive data, leading to a complete compromise of the token's security.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the security token to perform fault injection.
    *   **Fault Injection:** The specific attack vector involves using techniques to introduce faults into the hardware, which allows bypassing security checks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Physical access to the token**: An attacker needs to have physical access to the token.
    *   **Technical expertise**: Ability to perform fault injection attacks.
    *   **Specialized Equipment**: Requires specialized equipment for fault injection.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing information on the attack methodology (fault injection), affected components (microcontrollers STM32L4, nRF52840), and the overall impact (firmware and secrets extraction).
* The content also highlights the significance of this finding by stating "it is not always easy to rely on hardware security features which are provided by chip manufacturers" and recommends to "carefully assess the security of microchips against physical attacks in a capable laboratory".

**4. Mitigation:**
* The content states that software-based countermeasures were developed to mitigate the vulnerabilities and that the proposed countermeasures were partially implemented.

**In summary, the provided content describes a fault injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-27208) that allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the read-out protection of the SoloKeys Solo & Somu and Nitrokey FIDO2 tokens, enabling firmware and secret extraction. This is caused by weaknesses in the hardware security features of the microcontrollers used in those tokens.**
