{
  "CVE-2020-27351": {
    "Description": "Various memory and file descriptor leaks were discovered in the Python interface to the APT package management runtime library, which could result in denial of service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by improper resource handling in the python-apt library, specifically within the arfile.cc, generic.h, tag.cc and tarfile.cc files where file descriptors and memory are leaked if a crafted or invalid .deb file is processed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "File descriptor leaks in `debfile_new`, `ararchive_new`, and `tagfile_new`",
      "Memory leaks when an invalid `.deb` file is processed.",
       "Reference cycles in `DebFile` and `TagFile`"
    ],
     "Impact": "Local denial of service. An attacker can cause the apt daemon to crash, hang, or consume excessive resources by providing a specially crafted .deb file. This could lead to the exhaustion of system resources, such as file descriptors, or memory leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a malformed `.deb` file is parsed by the `aptd` daemon.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged local user can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `.deb` file and sending it to the `aptd` daemon via the dbus interface, or by uploading it to archive management software like Launchpad."
