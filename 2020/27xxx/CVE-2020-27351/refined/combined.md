### Bug Description

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2020-168`, `GHSL-2020-169`, `GHSL-2020-170`

The [GitHub Security Lab](<https://securitylab.github.com>) team has identified potential security vulnerabilities in aptd.

We are committed to working with you to help resolve these issues. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of these issues with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `<email address hidden>` (please include `GHSL-2020-168`, `GHSL-2020-169`, or `GHSL-2020-170` as a reference).

If you are \_NOT\_ the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

The aptd daemon is a system service for installing and updating packages. It is accessible via [dbus](<https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>) and has a method named "InstallFile" which is used for installing local `.deb` packages. Although polkit is used to prevent an unprivileged user from using "InstallFile" to install a malicious `.deb` package, it does not prevent aptd from parsing the contents of the `.deb` file. The parsing logic is provided by two packages, [libapt-pkg-dev](<https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libapt-pkg-dev>) and [python-apt](<https://packages.ubuntu.com/source/focal/python-apt>), and is implemented in C. These two packages contain several bugs, which an unprivileged user can exploit to trigger a local denial of service attack.

## Product

aptd

## Tested Version

\* libapt-pkg-dev: version 2.0.2ubuntu0.1

\* python-apt: 2.0.0ubuntu0.20.04.1

\* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS

## Details

### Issue 1: aptd crash due to integer overflow in arfile.cc (GHSL-2020-168)

A crafted `.deb` package can trigger a negative integer overflow at [arfile.cc, line 116]([https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n116](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n116)):

```c

Memb->Size -= Len;

```

Due to the integer overflow, the value of `Memb->Size` is `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`. This leads to an out-of-memory error at [arfile.cc, line 602]([https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-apt/tree/python/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=0f7cc93acdb51d943114f1cd79002288c4ca4d24#n602](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/tree/python/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=0f7cc93acdb51d943114f1cd79002288c4ca4d24#n602)):

```c

char\* value = new char[member->Size];

```

The out-of-memory error causes aptd to crash.

Please note that the source locations above refer to two separate files, both named `arfile.cc`. The first is from the libapt-pkg-dev package and the second is from the python-apt package.

To trigger the crash, first use the attached source file named "createdeb.c" to generate the malicious `.deb` file:

```bash

gcc createdeb.c -o createdeb

./createdeb crash test.deb

```

Now use `dbus-send` to send the malicious `.deb` file to aptd:

```bash

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt org.debian.apt.InstallFile string:`realpath test.deb` boolean:true

method return time=1602245339.731762 sender=:1.287 -> destination=:1.288 serial=8 reply\_serial=2

   string "/org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb"

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb org.debian.apt.transaction.Run

```

Note that you need to use the "transaction id" returned by the first `dbus-send` in the second `dbus-send` command.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to local denial of service.

#### Resources

I have attached `createdeb.c`, which can be used to generate the malicious `.deb` file.

### Issue 2: aptd infinite loop due to integer overflow in arfile.cc (GHSL-2020-169)

This issue is very similar to issue 1, but is caused by a different bug. This bug occurs during the call to `StrToNum` at [arfile.cc, line 92]([https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n92](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n92)):

```c

StrToNum(Head.Size,Memb->Size,sizeof(Head.Size)) == false)

```

The bug is due to the use of `strtoul` in [StrToNum]([https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/strutl.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n1169](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/tree/apt-pkg/contrib/strutl.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=4c264e60b524855b211751e1632ba48526f6b44d#n1169)):

```c

// StrToNum - Convert a fixed length string to a number /\*{{{\*/

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------

/\* This is used in decoding the crazy fixed length string headers in

   tar and ar files. \*/

bool StrToNum(const char \*Str,unsigned long &Res,unsigned Len,unsigned Base)

{

   char S[30];

   if (Len >= sizeof(S))

      return false;

   memcpy(S,Str,Len);

   S[Len] = 0;

// All spaces is a zero

   Res = 0;

   unsigned I;

   for (I = 0; S[I] == ' '; I++);

   if (S[I] == 0)

      return true;

char \*End;

   Res = strtoul(S,&End,Base); <====== negative numbers accepted

   if (End == S)

      return false;

return true;

}

```

The bug is that `strtoul` allows the number to be negative. For example, it will accept the string "-60". I have written a proof-of-concept exploit which uses this to put the parser into an infinite loop.

To run the proof-of-concept, first use the attached source file named "createdeb.c" to generate the malicious `.deb` file:

```bash

gcc createdeb.c -o createdeb

./createdeb loop test.deb

```

Now use `dbus-send` to send the malicious `.deb` file to aptd:

```bash

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt org.debian.apt.InstallFile string:`realpath test.deb` boolean:true

method return time=1602245339.731762 sender=:1.287 -> destination=:1.288 serial=8 reply\_serial=2

   string "/org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb"

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb org.debian.apt.transaction.Run

```

Note that you need to use the "transaction id" returned by the first `dbus-send` in the second `dbus-send` command.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to local denial of service.

#### Resources

I have attached `createdeb.c`, which can be used to generate the malicious `.deb` file.

### Issue 3: aptd file descriptor leak (GHSL-2020-170)

There is a file descriptor leak in `debfile\_new` at [arfile.cc, line 588]([https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-apt/tree/python/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=0f7cc93acdb51d943114f1cd79002288c4ca4d24#n588](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/tree/python/arfile.cc?h=applied/ubuntu/focal-updates&id=0f7cc93acdb51d943114f1cd79002288c4ca4d24#n588)):

```c

static PyObject \*debfile\_new(PyTypeObject \*type, PyObject \*args, PyObject \*kwds)

{

    PyDebFileObject \*self = (PyDebFileObject\*)ararchive\_new(type, args, kwds);

    if (self == NULL)

        return NULL;

// DebFile

    self->control = debfile\_get\_tar(self, "control.tar");

    if (self->control == NULL)

        return NULL; <===== self is not freed, so a file descriptor is leaked

```

If the `.deb` file is invalid, then `debfile\_new()` returns `NULL`, forgetting to free `self`. This means that the file descriptor for the `.deb` file is not closed. An attacker could use this to exhaust the system's file descriptors, causing a local denial of service.

To run the proof-of-concept, first use the attached source file named "createdeb.c" to generate the malicious `.deb` file:

```bash

gcc createdeb.c -o createdeb

./createdeb leakfd test.deb

```

Now use `dbus-send` to send the malicious `.deb` file to aptd:

```bash

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt org.debian.apt.InstallFile string:`realpath test.deb` boolean:true

method return time=1602245339.731762 sender=:1.287 -> destination=:1.288 serial=8 reply\_serial=2

   string "/org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb"

$ dbus-send --system --type="method\_call" --print-reply --dest=org.debian.apt /org/debian/apt/transaction/90f29de930854568964af1918f6ca5eb org.debian.apt.transaction.Run

```

Note that you need to use the "transaction id" returned by the first `dbus-send` in the second `dbus-send` command. Every time you run the PoC, aptd will open another file descriptor to the `.deb` file, which you can observe by running `lsof -p <pid of aptd>`.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to local denial of service.

#### Resources

I have attached `createdeb.c`, which can be used to generate the malicious `.deb` file.

I don't understand the focus on aptd here given that none of the bugs are in there, and I'll have to see if I can come up with a reproducer to integrate with the tests, and see if it's all fixable. This also affects package kit and apt itself, likely.

I don't care all that much about denial of services, there are likely easier approaches than using these issues.

Also, shouldn't they only be exploitable as root anyway? If not, we should really be worrying why we read deb files in the root daemon without having done policy kit checking.

Hi Julian,

I am sorry if reported this bug to the wrong package. I followed the "bug reports" link from this page: <https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libapt-pkg-dev>

These bugs do not require any privileges to trigger. As you say, I think part of the problem is that polkit checking is done too late. Although the main problem is, of course, the bugs in the C code.

Thanks,

Kev

Don't worry, it's in the right spot, I just thought it's an aptdaemon bug from the messaging, but then it's 3 (well 4) bugs spread all over apt, python-apt, and (policykit) aptdaemon.

Practically speaking, the main problem is the late policykit check, not the bugs in the C code, because once you passed that, you are in the trusted zone anyway. The package scripts run as root a few moments later anyway, and that gives me much better opportunities to do harm. Or you install setuid binaries.

In summary, the input to those daemons (and apt binaries) that run as root must be trusted. Now neither has (had for PK) appropriate checks at the right spot, so well, that's bad. I wonder what QApt does.

Now, aptdaemon isn't used much anymore past 16.04 - only for non-security updates, so the impact of DoS-ing aptdaemon is not the most critical out there, which is good. The rest installs via PackageKit or directly using apt (security updates). And I think aptdaemon does not acquire locks at the point where those issues happen, so security updates would still apply fine.

There is software where I think this is more critical, e.g. archive management like Launchpad and dak uses it to analyse packages, and you can then crash certain queues or hang them. Now Launchpad has some protection by running them separately, but I'm not sure how well it deals with those infinite loops - if one queue "hangs". So basically, you can DoS whatever archive(s) you can upload too.

#1 and #2 only require fixes in apt:

So #2. Is it really infinite, isn't it basically too big? Similar to when you start reading the file, but the file is truncated.

Now, apparently we do require that we know the size of the arfile (which is stored in Left), so what we should do I guess is

if (Memb->Size > Left) {

    delete Memb;

    return \_error->Error(\_("Invalid archive member header"))

}

which fixes the issue and also detects truncated files. Well, I guess the message could also say the archive is truncated, but everything else uses this message.

Now #1 we know that Memb->Size is as correct as it will get, so the step here seems to be to add

if (Len > Memb->Size) {

    delete Memb;

    return \_error->Error(\_("Invalid archive member header"))

}

This ensures that the length we parse for the long name is shorter than the member, which is correct.

#3 needs wrapping object in a smart pointer so the fd is relased. This also needs similar changes in ararchive\_new, and possibly a whole bunch of other code that opens files on its own. Further investigation is necessary.

The good thing is that we should be able to get unit tests for all of those. For FDs we count open fds before and after an erronous call, and #1#2 we can check that the malicious debs fail with an error :)

I'm now also looking into where aptd opens those files in the first place, and how we can move the PolicyKit check before that, as we really don't want untrusted users to be able to parse/decompress random files in a root process, which happens if it's reading the deb.

  (10.6 KiB,

Attached patch for the first two issues, the ones in apt. I embedded the provided test creator code (reformatted), I assume it's fine distributing this as GPL-2+ in apt?

The test case shows that the created debs are properly rejected.

This should apply to apt 1.3 and later, older versions (e.g. 1.2 in xenial) need an adjustment for the old buildsystem - replacing the CMakeLists bit with a makefile one (and I vaguely recall helper path lookup worked differently there, need to test)

Please give it a try! Four/six eyes see more than 2.

### Issue 3: aptd file descriptor leak (GHSL-2020-170)

I also found out that if the function returns successfully, the runtime won't immediately deallocate the object once it's reference count reaches zero, so e.g.

def f():

    apt\_inst.DebFile("../apt\_1.9.5\_amd64.deb")

f()

will cause an extra fd to be used, until the cyclic garbage collector ran. I think this is a problem I introduced years ago when I made them subclassable because that somehow required adding GC support or something - I don't remember.

In any case, this means, that these need to become context managers or at least gain a close() method so that they can be closed when no longer needed.

arfile\_new has the same issue FWIW, if there's an error somewhere and the file was opened, it leaks it, as does tagfile\_new; and both of them also have memory leaks as they never free those objects in these error cases.

Attached is a patch for the error cases in debfile\_new (and ArArchive and TagFile). It works by decreasing the reference count of the object on error paths, and clearing the cycles, so that the object will be collected and the FD released once the function returns.

A test case will be added shortly, that will do os.listdir(/proc/self/fd) before and after calls to ensure that the number of file descriptors is the same.

Because the reason it needed a GC run before was: It turns out I do have cycles in both DebFile and TagFile:

DebFile contains references to data.tar and control.tar members, which in point hold references to the DebFile, so as to make sure that the file stays around while the data needs it.

TagFile links to a TagSection which links back to the TagFile, as the data is actually stored in the tagfile buffer. Oh dear.

I suppose I could fix them both correctly by removing the cycle, e.g. abstracting the File to a FileCommon that both File and Section/member reference, then existing code relying on reference counts will start behaving correctly.

What happens with those return NULL cases if the data.tar or control.tar entries don't exist? Is that a new leak? I expected a self.release() before those cases.

(Or, alternatively, I don't understand the 'return self.release()' idiom.)

There's also a minor typo "file descritor" in the header. Do what you wish with this.

Cleaning up the integer overflows and filedescriptor leaks feels like a good idea; however I'm inclined to say there's one CVE (or perhaps one per software package, if it's truly scattered around correctly) for misplaced polkit checks -- does that sound correct?

Thanks

We certainly want a CVE for moving the root check earlier I suppose, if that's doable with the API - I've not looked at how that all interacts in practice.

I think we need one CVE for each of these things? The code was not meant for untrusted input, but archive tools like launchpad use it for such (albeit in one process per PPA or so, so you can like only DoS a PPA you have write access to).

OK, so release() releases ownership from the smart pointer to the caller (by setting the internal pointer to NULL and returning it).

Just returning NULL without calling release means the smart pointer object will decrement the reference count and hence deallocate it.

See <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/release> for more information about the origin of the idiom.

Thanks for the descriptions; I always assumed there was a lot more magic to unique\_ptr. I hadn't expected a dozen-line implementation.

This one's a little complicated:

CVE-2020-27349 (aptdaemon, LP: [#1899193](/bugs/1899193)) -- policykit checks are too late

CVE-2020-27350 (apt, LP: [#1899193](/bugs/1899193)) -- apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc missing comparisons GHSL-2020-168 GHSL-2020-169

CVE-2020-27351 (python-apt, LP: [#1899193](/bugs/1899193)) -- python/arfile.cc, python/tag.cc, python/tarfile.cc -- various memory and file descriptor leaks GHSL-2020-170

I'm not 100% sure on lumping together memory leaks (missing free) and file descriptor leaks (missing close) but as they are both missing release of resource, and the same patch addresses both, I don't see a benefit to another CVE in this case.

I still wonder if we also should try to fix aptdaemon to explictly close the files it opens, as we can't rely on Python doing that automatically due to the reference cycles in DebFile, and if that needs a CVE as well - I have no idea if it's practically exploitable.

You need to give it a deb that's valid enough to open, aka has data.tar.xz and control.tar.xz and debian-binary members but then is being rejected by aptdaemon itself after the object is created (e.g. control.tar.xz contains nonsense).

Arguably if we fix the PolicyKit interaction, that's enough to go on the aptdaemon side.

Attached patch addresses the reference loop in apt\_inst.DebFile, ensuring that no longer referencing the object will release it immediately, as opposed to when the cycle GC runs.

Subject: [PATCH] apt\_inst.DebFile: Avoid reference cycle with control,data

 members

apt\_inst.DebFile provides two members `data` and `control` for

easy access to those tarballs. Each of those members stores a

reference to the DebFile as its owner:

    v-----------------\

        control ----\ |

                     -> deb -|

        data ----/ |

           ^-----------------/

This means that whenever a DebFile is successfully constructed,

and no longer needed, it won't be collected until the GC runs,

which is bad, as the DebFile holds an open FileFd.

Introduce a \_\_FileFd wrapper that holds the FileFd and becomes

the owner of both control and data, and replaces the direct use

of the FileFd in ArArchive/DebFile:

   v-----------------------------\

        control ----\ \

                     -> \_\_FileFd <- deb -|

        data ----/ /

          ^-----------------------------/

This avoids the reference cycle, ensuring the memory and file

descriptor are released by the reference counter as soon as

the reference count drops to 0.

A future version should move `apt\_inst.\_\_FileFd` to `apt\_pkg.FileFd`

and expose all the methods, such that people can make use of FileFd's

extensive compression support.

We have a similar cycle in TagFile that we have yet to address,

the problem there is arguably more frustrating, as the buffer

I believe is stored inside the TagFile, and that's really shared

between the TagSection objects.

This is related to LP: [#1899193](/bugs/1899193) and CVE-2020-27351, but an additional

hardening measure - the fix for those bugs was for more direct leaks.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
