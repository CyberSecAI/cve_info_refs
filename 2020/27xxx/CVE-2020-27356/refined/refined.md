**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27356

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The DebugMetaData WordPress plugin is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize user-controlled input within the user agent string during login requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript can be injected and persistently stored in the application.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the user agent string during the login process, allowing script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- User Impersonation: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to impersonate the user on the application.
- Credential Theft: The XSS vulnerability can be used to steal user credentials.
- Malicious Actions: Attackers can perform any action within the scope of the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Intercepted Login Request: An attacker would need to intercept a login request.
- User Agent String Injection: The attacker would inject a malicious JavaScript payload into the user agent string of the intercepted login request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Account: The attacker needs a user account on the affected WordPress application.
- Network Interception Capabilities: The attacker needs the ability to intercept HTTP login requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user navigates to their profile page (`hxxps://WORDPRESSBASEURL/wp-admin/profile.php`).
- The plugin developer has chosen not to fix the reported vulnerability.
- The plugin has not been tested with the latest 3 major releases of WordPress.
