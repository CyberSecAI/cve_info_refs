| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-03-18 18:33:26 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in the Linux Kernel in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in retrieve_ptr_limit that computes the 'size' of the valid memory 'ptr_limit' for registers ('stack' and 'map_value') for the purpose of bound checks. In this flaw there was an off-by-one for the area size, which may lead to an incorrect mask creation to the left, and thus incorrect arithmetic operation in the non-speculative domain.  In this flaw a local attacker, with a special user privilege 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' (Moderate impact flaw)  may leak the kernel internal information, and may even cause a denial-of-service problem.     Additional Information:  # Bug Fix  The minimal fix is:  * bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899> ]  However it is recommended to use the whole series that also includes fix for another similar vulnerability reported at the same time and improvements of the affected code:  * bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr_limit [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76> ] * bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899> ] * bpf: Simplify alu_limit masking for pointer arithmetic [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=b5871dca250cd391885218b99cc015aca1a51aea> ] * bpf: Add sanity check for upper ptr_limit [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=1b1597e64e1a610c7a96710fc4717158e98a08b3> ] * bpf, selftests: Fix up some test_verifier cases for unprivileged [ <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=0a13e3537ea67452d549a6a80da3776d6b7dedb3> ]   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c1)  msiddiqu    2021-03-19 10:26:41 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1940838](show_bug.cgi?id=1940838 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-27171 kernel: Integer underflow when restricting speculative pointer arithmetic [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c5)  Rohit Keshri    2021-03-25 21:56:45 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Piotr Krysiuk <piotras>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c9)  Petr Matousek    2021-03-31 15:21:33 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl.   This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.  For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled  The setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c10)  Rohit Keshri    2021-04-07 05:09:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel differs from the upstream, that  prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl.     The setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF (which is a default setting), and this mitigating the flaw.  This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space, and may even cause a denial-of-service problem.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c11)  Jiri Olsa    2021-04-16 17:41:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Pedro Sampaio from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c0)) > The minimal fix is: >  > * bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899 ] >  > However it is recommended to use the whole series that also includes > fix for another similar vulnerability reported at the same time and > improvements of the affected code: >  > * bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr_limit [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76 ] > * bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899 ] > * bpf: Simplify alu_limit masking for pointer arithmetic [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=b5871dca250cd391885218b99cc015aca1a51aea ] > * bpf: Add sanity check for upper ptr_limit [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=1b1597e64e1a610c7a96710fc4717158e98a08b3 ] > * bpf, selftests: Fix up some test_verifier cases for unprivileged [ > <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/> > ?id=0a13e3537ea67452d549a6a80da3776d6b7dedb3 ]  hi this is same set of commits like for [BZ1940627](show_bug.cgi?id=1940627 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-27170 kernel: Speculation on pointer arithmetic against bpf_context pointer"), which is already on the way to be merged  how should I close this one?  thanks, jirka   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1940623#c12)  Rohit Keshri    2021-04-18 15:26:59 UTC  ``` Hello Jirka, thanks you for bringing this to us, researcher in this category of flaw has a multiple recommended patches, among which [CVE-2020-27170](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27170) and [CVE-2020-27171](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27171) were recorded.  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76> Subject: bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr_limit  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899>    Subject: bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left   Since this both patch was purposed to streamline error propagation on ptr_limit in kernel/bpf/verifier.c for two different functions sanitize_ptr_alu() and retrieve_ptr_limit() with a minimal and absolute fix suggested as below.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Subject: [CVE-2020-27170] Protection against speculatively out-of-bounds loads
 in the Linux kernel can be bypassed by unprivileged local users to leak
 content of kernel memory

A gap in the Linux kernel mechanism to mitigate speculatively
out-of-bounds loads (Spectre mitigation) has been identified.

Unprivileged BPF programs running on affected systems can bypass
the protection and execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads from
any location within the kernel memory. This can be abused to extract
contents of kernel memory via side-channel.

The identified gap is that unprivileged BPF programs are allowed to
perform pointer arithmetic on particular pointer types not defining
ptr_limit. Pointer arithmetic on such pointer types is not protected
against out-of-bounds speculation.

I developed a PoC to demonstrate the issue using ctx pointers that
allows unprivileged local users to extract contents of kernel memory.

The PoC has been shared privately with <security@...nel.org> to assist
with fix development.

The patches are available from BPF subsystem public git repository. The
minimal fix is:

* bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr_limit [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76>
]

However it is recommended to apply the whole series as it includes
fix for another speculatively out-of-bounds vulnerability in BPF that
I reported at the same time and some additional hardening of the
affected code:

* bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr_limit [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76>
]
* bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899>
]
* bpf: Simplify alu_limit masking for pointer arithmetic [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=b5871dca250cd391885218b99cc015aca1a51aea>
]
* bpf: Add sanity check for upper ptr_limit [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=1b1597e64e1a610c7a96710fc4717158e98a08b3>
]
* bpf, selftests: Fix up some test_verifier cases for unprivileged [
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/patch/?id=0a13e3537ea67452d549a6a80da3776d6b7dedb3>

bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr\_limitThe purpose of this patch is to streamline error propagation and in particular
to propagate retrieve\_ptr\_limit() errors for pointer types that are not defining
a ptr\_limit such that register-based alu ops against these types can be rejected.
The main rationale is that a gap has been identified by Piotr in the existing
protection against speculatively out-of-bounds loads, for example, in case of
ctx pointers, unprivileged programs can still perform pointer arithmetic. This
can be abused to execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads without restrictions
and thus extract contents of kernel memory.
Fix this by rejecting unprivileged programs that attempt any pointer arithmetic
on unprotected pointer types. The two affected ones are pointer to ctx as well
as pointer to map. Field access to a modified ctx' pointer is rejected at a
later point in time in the verifier, and 7c6967326267 ("bpf: Permit map\_ptr
arithmetic with opcode add and offset 0") only relevant for root-only use cases.
Risk of unprivileged program breakage is considered very low.

Subject: Re: [CVE-2020-27170] Protection against speculatively out-of-bounds
 loads in the Linux kernel can be bypassed by unprivileged local users to leak
 content of kernel memory

Some details of how CVE-2020-27170 could be exploited in practice were
provided via linux-distros mailing list with 7 days embargo. This was
intended to help any affected Linux distributions to assess the risk
and decide about any appropriate actions.

As the embargo expires today, I was asked to share these details
publically on oss-security.

The CVE-2020-27170 vulnerability has been successfully reproduced
against Linux kernel v5.12-rc3 using the following logic for BPF
program attached to a socket:

    load bpf_context pointer (BPF_REG_1) into BPF_REG_CTX,
    load pointer to our big array into BPF_REG_MAP_PTR,
    load offset of data to leak into BPF_REG_OFFSET,

    // load any slowly-loaded value...
    BPF_LDX_MEM(BPF_DW, BPF_REG_SLOW_CHECK, BPF_REG_MAP_PTR, 0x1200),

    // ... and turn it into known zero for verifier,
    // while preserving slowly-loaded dependency for affected hardware
    BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_AND, BPF_REG_SLOW_CHECK, 1),
    BPF_ALU64_IMM(BPF_AND, BPF_REG_SLOW_CHECK, 2),

    // speculatively bypassed offset check
    BPF_JMP_REG(BPF_JNE, BPF_REG_OFFSET, BPF_REG_SLOW_CHECK,
                skip_speculation),

    // speculatively unbounded pointer arithmetic
    BPF_ALU64_REG(BPF_ADD, BPF_REG_CTX, BPF_REG_OFFSET),

    // speculatively unbounded load
    BPF_LDX_MEM(BPF_W, BPF_REG_LEAKED_WORD, BPF_REG_CTX,
                offsetof(struct __sk_buff, protocol)),

    transmit speculatively loaded BPF_REG_LEAKED_WORD via side-channel,

The full reproducers were shared with a number of Linux distributions
for protection purposes.

Debian Bug     : 983595

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-27170, CVE-2020-27171

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered flaws in the BPF subsystem's checks for
    information leaks through speculative execution.  A local user
    could use these to obtain sensitive information from kernel
    memory.

CVE-2021-3348

    ADlab of venustech discovered a race condition in the nbd block
    driver that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user with
    access to an nbd block device could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the
    ext4 filesystem driver.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results.  An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.  For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled. For the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:  # cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled  The setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.

crypto: x86/aes-ni-xts - use direct calls to and 4-way stride
commit 86ad60a65f29dd862a11c22bb4b5be28d6c5cef1 upstream.
The XTS asm helper arrangement is a bit odd: the 8-way stride helper
consists of back-to-back calls to the 4-way core transforms, which
are called indirectly, based on a boolean that indicates whether we
are performing encryption or decryption.
Given how costly indirect calls are on x86, let's switch to direct
calls, and given how the 8-way stride doesn't really add anything
substantial, use a 4-way stride instead, and make the asm core
routine deal with any multiple of 4 blocks. Since 512 byte sectors
or 4 KB blocks are the typical quantities XTS operates on, increase
the stride exported to the glue helper to 512 bytes as well.
As a result, the number of indirect calls is reduced from 3 per 64 bytes
of in/output to 1 per 512 bytes of in/output, which produces a 65% speedup
when operating on 1 KB blocks (measured on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU)

net: dsa: b53: Support setting learning on port
commit f9b3827ee66cfcf297d0acd6ecf33653a5f297ef upstream.
Add support for being able to set the learning attribute on port, and
make sure that the standalone ports start up with learning disabled.
We can remove the code in bcm\_sf2 that configured the ports learning
attribute because we want the standalone ports to have learning disabled
by default and port 7 cannot be bridged, so its learning attribute will
not change past its initial configuration.

Revert "nfsd4: a client's own opens needn't prevent delegations"
commit 6ee65a773096ab3f39d9b00311ac983be5bdeb7c upstream.
This reverts commit 94415b06eb8aed13481646026dc995f04a3a534a.
That commit claimed to allow a client to get a read delegation when it
was the only writer. Actually it allowed a client to get a read
delegation when \*any\* client has a write open!
The main problem is that it's depending on nfs4\_clnt\_odstate structures
that are actually only maintained for pnfs exports.
This causes clients to miss writes performed by other clients, even when
there have been intervening closes and opens, violating close-to-open
cache consistency.
We can do this a different way, but first we should just revert this.
I've added pynfs 4.1 test DELEG19 to test for this, as I should have
done originally!

fuse: fix live lock in fuse\_iget()
commit 775c5033a0d164622d9d10dd0f0a5531639ed3ed upstream.
Commit 5d069dbe8aaf ("fuse: fix bad inode") replaced make\_bad\_inode()
in fuse\_iget() with a private implementation fuse\_make\_bad().
The private implementation fails to remove the bad inode from inode
cache, so the retry loop with iget5\_locked() finds the same bad inode
and marks it bad forever.

RDMA/srp: Fix support for unpopulated and unbalanced NUMA nodes
commit 2b5715fc17386a6223490d5b8f08d031999b0c0b upstream.
The current code computes a number of channels per SRP target and spreads
them equally across all online NUMA nodes. Each channel is then assigned
a CPU within this node.
In the case of unbalanced, or even unpopulated nodes, some channels do not
get a CPU associated and thus do not get connected. This causes the SRP
connection to fail.
This patch solves the issue by rewriting channel computation and
allocation:
- Drop channel to node/CPU association as it had no real effect on
locality but added unnecessary complexity.
- Tweak the number of channels allocated to reduce CPU contention when
possible:
- Up to one channel per CPU (instead of up to 4 by node)
- At least 4 channels per node, unless ch\_count module parameter is
used.

Fix up test\_verifier error messages for the case where the original error
message changed, or for the case where pointer alu errors differ between
privileged and unprivileged tests. Also, add alternative tests for keeping
coverage of the original verifier rejection error message (fp alu), and
newly reject map\_ptr += rX where rX == 0 given we now forbid alu on these
types for unprivileged. All test\_verifier cases pass after the change. The
test case fixups were kept separate to ease backporting of core changes.

bpf: Add sanity check for upper ptr\_limit
commit 1b1597e64e1a610c7a96710fc4717158e98a08b3 upstream.
Given we know the max possible value of ptr\_limit at the time of retrieving
the latter, add basic assertions, so that the verifier can bail out if
anything looks odd and reject the program. Nothing triggered this so far,
but it also does not hurt to have these.

bpf: Simplify alu\_limit masking for pointer arithmetic
commit b5871dca250cd391885218b99cc015aca1a51aea upstream.
Instead of having the mov32 with aux->alu\_limit - 1 immediate, move this
operation to retrieve\_ptr\_limit() instead to simplify the logic and to
allow for subsequent sanity boundary checks inside retrieve\_ptr\_limit().
This avoids in future that at the time of the verifier masking rewrite
we'd run into an underflow which would not sign extend due to the nature
of mov32 instruction.

bpf: Fix off-by-one for area size in creating mask to left
commit 10d2bb2e6b1d8c4576c56a748f697dbeb8388899 upstream.
retrieve\_ptr\_limit() computes the ptr\_limit for registers with stack and
map\_value type. ptr\_limit is the size of the memory area that is still
valid / in-bounds from the point of the current position and direction
of the operation (add / sub). This size will later be used for masking
the operation such that attempting out-of-bounds access in the speculative
domain is redirected to remain within the bounds of the current map value.
When masking to the right the size is correct, however, when masking to
the left, the size is off-by-one which would lead to an incorrect mask
and thus incorrect arithmetic operation in the non-speculative domain.
Piotr found that if the resulting alu\_limit value is zero, then the
BPF\_MOV32\_IMM() from the fixup\_bpf\_calls() rewrite will end up loading
0xffffffff into AX instead of sign-extending to the full 64 bit range,
and as a result, this allows abuse for executing speculatively out-of-
bounds loads against 4GB window of address space and thus extracting the
contents of kernel memory via side-channel.

bpf: Prohibit alu ops for pointer types not defining ptr\_limit
commit f232326f6966cf2a1d1db7bc917a4ce5f9f55f76 upstream.
The purpose of this patch is to streamline error propagation and in particular
to propagate retrieve\_ptr\_limit() errors for pointer types that are not defining
a ptr\_limit such that register-based alu ops against these types can be rejected.
The main rationale is that a gap has been identified by Piotr in the existing
protection against speculatively out-of-bounds loads, for example, in case of
ctx pointers, unprivileged programs can still perform pointer arithmetic. This
can be abused to execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads without restrictions
and thus extract contents of kernel memory.
Fix this by rejecting unprivileged programs that attempt any pointer arithmetic
on unprotected pointer types. The two affected ones are pointer to ctx as well
as pointer to map. Field access to a modified ctx' pointer is rejected at a
later point in time in the verifier, and 7c6967326267 ("bpf: Permit map\_ptr
arithmetic with opcode add and offset 0") only relevant for root-only use cases.
Risk of unprivileged program breakage is considered very low.

gfs2: bypass signal\_our\_withdraw if no journal
[ Upstream commit d5bf630f355d8c532bef2347cf90e8ae60a5f1bd ]
Before this patch, function signal\_our\_withdraw referenced the journal
inode immediately. But corrupt file systems may have some invalid
journals, in which case our attempt to read it in will withdraw and the
resulting signal\_our\_withdraw would dereference the NULL value.
This patch adds a check to signal\_our\_withdraw so that if the journal
has not yet been initialized, it simply returns and does the old-style
withdraw.
Thanks, Andy Price, for his analysis.

gfs2: move freeze glock outside the make\_fs\_rw and \_ro functions
[ Upstream commit 96b1454f2e8ede4c619fde405a1bb4e9ba8d218e ]
Before this patch, sister functions gfs2\_make\_fs\_rw and gfs2\_make\_fs\_ro locked
(held) the freeze glock by calling gfs2\_freeze\_lock and gfs2\_freeze\_unlock.
The problem is, not all the callers of gfs2\_make\_fs\_ro should be doing this.
The three callers of gfs2\_make\_fs\_ro are: remount (gfs2\_reconfigure),
signal\_our\_withdraw, and unmount (gfs2\_put\_super). But when unmounting the
file system we can get into the following circular lock dependency:
deactivate\_super
down\_write(&s->s\_umount); <-------------------------------------- s\_umount
deactivate\_locked\_super
gfs2\_kill\_sb
kill\_block\_super
generic\_shutdown\_super
gfs2\_put\_super
gfs2\_make\_fs\_ro
gfs2\_glock\_nq\_init sd\_freeze\_gl
freeze\_go\_sync
if (freeze glock in SH)
freeze\_super (vfs)
down\_write(&sb->s\_umount); <------- s\_umount
This patch moves the hold of the freeze glock outside the two sister rw/ro
functions to their callers, but it doesn't request the glock from
gfs2\_put\_super, thus eliminating the circular dependency.

The driver uses the DVS registers PCA9450\_REG\_BUCKxOUT\_DVS0 to set the
voltage for the buck regulators 1, 2 and 3. This has no effect as the
PRESET\_EN bit is set by default and therefore the preset values are used
instead, which are set to 850 mV.
To fix this we clear the PRESET\_EN bit at time of initialization.

By default the PCA9450 doesn't handle the assertion of the WDOG\_B

resets triggered by the watchdog work reliably.
As we don't want to rely on the bootloader to enable this, we tell
the PMIC to issue a cold reset in case the WDOG\_B signal is
asserted (WDOG\_B\_CFG = 10), just as the NXP U-Boot code does.

regulator: pca9450: Add SD\_VSEL GPIO for LDO5
[ Upstream commit 8c67a11bae889f51fe5054364c3c789dfae3ad73 ]
LDO5 has two separate control registers. LDO5CTRL\_L is used if the
input signal SD\_VSEL is low and LDO5CTRL\_H if it is high.
The current driver implementation only uses LDO5CTRL\_H. To make this
work on boards that have SD\_VSEL connected to a GPIO, we add support
for specifying an optional GPIO and setting it to high at probe time.
In the future we might also want to add support for boards that have
SD\_VSEL set to a fixed low level. In this case we need to change the
driver to be able to use the LDO5CTRL\_L register.
