- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization when adding a new field definition within the News Module settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability occurs due to the application not encoding HTML elements within user-provided input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the field definition of the News Module. When a user interacts with this field definition, the injected script executes within the user's browser, which could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the admin interface of CMS Made Simple. An attacker with the necessary privileges can access the "Field Definitions" section of the News Module settings and inject the payload by adding a new field definition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access or the privileges required to modify the News Module settings. They should be able to access the admin panel to navigate to the "Field Definitions" settings of the News module.
