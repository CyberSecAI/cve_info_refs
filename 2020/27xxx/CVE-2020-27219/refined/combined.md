## Description

![@Holger-Seemueller](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74291188?v=4&size=48)[Holger-Seemueller](https://github.com/Holger-Seemueller)opened [on Jan 11, 2021](https://github.com/eclipse-hawkbit/hawkbit/issues/1067#issue-783135215)

Hi,

our security team reported an issue with our Hawkbit instance:

Request:

POST to /cgi-bin/<script>xss-test<script>.asp

Response:

{"timestamp":"2021-01-11T07:18:10.650+0000","status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"Not Found","path":"/cgi-bin/<script>xss-test</script>.asp"}

I was able to reproduce this behavior on your sandbox instance. Btw. for GET requests the path is not returned.

Could you please provide a fix or a workaround for that behavior?

Kind regards,

Holger
