Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27050:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a potential out-of-bounds (OOB) write in the `rw_t3t_send_raw_frame` function within the Android NFC subsystem.
*   Another related potential OOB write is present in `rw_i93_send_cmd_write_multi_blocks` function within the same component

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Out-of-bounds write: The vulnerability allows writing data outside the intended memory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Elevation of Privilege (EoP): As described in the Pixel Update Bulletin, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to an elevation of privilege.
*   The ability to write to arbitrary memory locations could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, corrupt system data, or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is within the NFC subsystem.
*   An attacker would likely need to interact with the NFC functionality of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position to interact with the NFC functionality of the targeted device. This could involve physical proximity to initiate an NFC interaction, or potentially a crafted NFC signal.
*   The attacker would need to craft a specific input to the vulnerable function that triggers the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit messages identify the affected functions and state "Potential OOB write".
*   The Pixel Update Bulletin classifies this vulnerability as a Moderate severity EoP vulnerability.
* The fix is present in the commit logs provided in the analysis.
