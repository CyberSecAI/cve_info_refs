### Vulnerability Details for CVE-2020-27302

- **Vulnerability:** Stack overflow in WPA2 key parsing
- **CVSS Score:** 8.0 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- **Affected Component:** Realtek RTL8710C Wi-Fi module.
- **Root Cause:** The `DecGTK()` function, which is part of the WPA2 handshake processing, contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, after decrypting data using `AES_UnWRAP()`, the function calls `_wrap_memcpy()` to copy bytes from a temporary buffer (`tmp2`) to an output buffer (`kout`). The size of the data copied is taken from user-controlled input (`v__size_1`) without proper bounds checking. Since `kout` has a fixed size of 0x80 bytes, setting `v__size_1` to a value larger than 0x80 will cause a stack overflow.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker within Wi-Fi range needs to know the network's PSK (pre-shared key).
- **Exploitation Steps:**
  1.  Sniff Wi-Fi packets to identify the target network's SSID.
  2.  Set up a malicious access point (AP) with the same SSID.
  3.  Send a deauthentication packet to the victim to force it to connect to the malicious AP.
  4.  During the 4-way handshake, send a crafted EAPOL-Key message with a large encrypted GTK value to trigger the overflow.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution on WPA2 clients using the vulnerable Wi-Fi module, potentially granting root access on the device's OS.
- **Prerequisites:** The attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network or know the network's PSK. The vulnerability affects Wi-Fi client devices using the Realtek RTL8710C module.
- **Affected Devices:** Embedded and IoT devices using the RTL8710C Wi-Fi module. Examples of industries affected include agriculture, automotive, energy, gaming, healthcare, industrial, security, and smart home.
- **Mitigation:** Update to a version built after January 11, 2021, or use a strong, private WPA2 passphrase.
