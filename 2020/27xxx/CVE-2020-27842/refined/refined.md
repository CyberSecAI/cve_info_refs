- Gentoo Security Advisory - mentions CVE-2020-27842 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of CVE-2020-27842 is a null pointer dereference in the `opj_tgt_reset` function within the `lib/openjp2/tgt.c` file of the OpenJPEG library. This occurs when processing specially crafted input.
- In Oracle Outside In Technology, the vulnerability is triggered by processing malformed data by the OpenJPEG library, which is part of that product, leading to the null pointer dereference.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is a null pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory via a pointer that holds a null value, leading to a crash.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted input, indicating a lack of proper validation before processing.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. A successful exploit will cause the program to crash due to the null pointer dereference, making the affected system or application unavailable.
- In Oracle Outside In Technology, the crash can lead to reduced availability of the application relying on the library.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing specially crafted or malformed input data to the affected software that utilizes the vulnerable OpenJPEG library.
- **Network:** This can occur over a network, especially for services processing externally provided data, or via local file system manipulation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious or specially crafted input to the vulnerable component.
- This could involve providing malformed image files to a server application, or crafting malicious input data for a client application that uses the vulnerable library.
- No authentication is required for a remote exploit according to the risk matrix in Oracle's July 2021 CPU.
- For some products like Oracle Outside In Technology, successful exploitation can happen through simply passing data, often received over the network, directly to the vulnerable software.

**Additional Technical Details**

*   **File and Function:** The vulnerability specifically exists in the `opj_tgt_reset` function within the `lib/openjp2/tgt.c` file of the OpenJPEG library.
*   **Patches:** Patches for the vulnerability primarily involve changes to the code to prevent the null pointer dereference.
*   **Multiple Products:** This vulnerability affects multiple products and components that use OpenJPEG.

In summary, CVE-2020-27842 is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in OpenJPEG, triggered by specially crafted input, leading to a denial-of-service. It affects multiple products that use the OpenJPEG library, highlighting the importance of applying security updates to all affected components.
