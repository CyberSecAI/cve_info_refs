Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information within the DDNS (Dynamic DNS) functionality of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) when using the dnsExit provider. Specifically, the script `/usr/syno/bin/ddns/dnsexit.php` sends DNSExit credentials over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the transmission of the dnsExit username and password in the URL over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
- **Lack of Encryption:** The absence of HTTPS means that the transmitted data is vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Disclosure:** A successful man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack allows the attacker to intercept the HTTP request and extract the DNSExit username and password.
- **Account Takeover:** With the compromised credentials, the attacker can potentially take over the registered subdomain associated with the dnsExit account. This could lead to various malicious activities such as redirecting traffic or serving malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The attacker needs to position themselves between the Synology device and the dnsExit server to intercept the communication.
- **Network Eavesdropping:** The attacker listens to network traffic, specifically for the vulnerable HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Synology device or have the ability to intercept network traffic between the device and the dnsExit server.
- **Passive Eavesdropping:** The attacker doesn't need to actively interact with the Synology device; they only need to passively monitor network traffic to capture the vulnerable HTTP request containing the credentials.
