**CVE-2020-27032**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability is related to the `getRadioAccessFamily` API within the Telephony service. The provided commit message "Check System permission for getRadioAccessFamily API" indicates that the root cause is a missing or insufficient permission check when accessing this API.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper permission checks. This allows unauthorized access to the `getRadioAccessFamily` API, which potentially handles sensitive information.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The CVE description lists the vulnerability type as "ID," meaning that exploiting this issue can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information that should be protected by system permissions. The specific details of what information is accessed through `getRadioAccessFamily` are not available in the provided content.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is in the Telephony service, suggesting it can be triggered by an application or service that can interact with the Telephony service API, specifically by calling the vulnerable `getRadioAccessFamily` API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would require a malicious application that can make calls to the Telephony API. This usually means they need to have an app installed on the user's device, possibly through social engineering or other exploitation methods.
    *   An attacker exploiting this does not necessarily need root privileges.
