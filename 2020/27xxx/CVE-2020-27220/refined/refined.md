Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a missing authorization check in the Eclipse Hono AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters. These adapters do not verify whether a gateway device is authorized to receive commands targeted at a specific device when it subscribes to commands for that device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The core vulnerability lies in the absence of a check to ensure that a gateway device is actually permitted to receive commands for a particular target device. This check should involve verifying if the command target device has granted permission for the gateway device to act on its behalf (i.e., the gateway is listed in the `via-gateways` of the target device).
*   **Incorrect Handling of Subscription Requests:** Although the system performs a check when sending the "ttd" (tenant-to-device) event message as part of the subscription request and an error is raised if unauthorized, the preceding command subscription is not revoked/removed, leaving the unauthorized subscription active. This is an incomplete authorization check.
*   **Protocol Adapter Specific:** The vulnerability is specific to the AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters and not present in HTTP or CoAP adapters, because the error in the "ttd" message in those adapters will abort the request and close the command subscription.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Command Reception:** An authenticated device, even one that is not a gateway, can subscribe to and receive command and control messages intended for a different device within the same tenant.
*   **Potential for Device Impersonation or Data Manipulation:** By receiving commands intended for other devices, an attacker could potentially impersonate these devices or manipulate their operations, leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have the ability to connect to the AMQP or MQTT endpoints provided by Eclipse Hono.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must authenticate as a device within the target tenant to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Subscription Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft subscription requests that specify the target device ID in the receiver link address or subscription topic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate as a device within the same tenant as the targeted device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the AMQP or MQTT endpoints of the vulnerable Eclipse Hono instance.
*   **Knowledge of AMQP or MQTT Protocols:** The attacker needs sufficient knowledge of these protocols to construct the necessary subscription requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Eclipse Hono versions 1.4.0 to 1.4.4 inclusive, and 1.5.0.

**Mitigation/Fix:**

The vulnerability has been fixed in Hono versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.0 by adding the missing authorization check for the subscriptions.
