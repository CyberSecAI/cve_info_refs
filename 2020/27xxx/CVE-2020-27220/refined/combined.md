| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=569856#c0)  Carsten Lohmann [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-12-21 08:45:05 EST  ``` Hono allows a gateway to subscribe for command messages that are directed at a device that the gateway may act on behalf of. For this, an authenticated gateway, connected via AMQP or MQTT, includes the corresponding device id in the receiver link address or subscription topic.  The issue is, that the AMQP and MQTT adapters currently don't check, whether the gateway is actually allowed to create such a command subscription for the given device id.  That means that any authenticated device (not necessarily a gateway) can use a different device id of the same tenant in the command receiver link address or subscription topic and thereby receive commands for that other device (of the same tenant).  The relevant check of the given device id (verifying that the authenticated device id is contained in the via-gateways of the given device) is only done when sending the "ttd" event message as part of the subscription request. Although there is an error there (rightfully so), the preceding command subscription is still kept in place. The issue doesn't exist for HTTP and CoAP adapters because the error sending the "ttd" message will abort the request and close the command subscription. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=569856#c1)  Kai Hudalla [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-12-23 08:00:08 EST  ``` This looks like a severe security issue and IMHO we should create a CVE for it. @Carsten can you make a proposal regarding the wording and the category? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569856#c2)  Carsten Lohmann [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-04 02:32:29 EST  ``` Here is the CVE report data that I would suggest to be used here. @Committers: Please comment if you like to see changes.  ---  project: Eclipse Hono  versions: 1.4.0, 1.5.0  CWE-862: Missing Authorization  summary: In Eclipse Hono version 1.4.0 and 1.5.0 the AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters do not check whether an authenticated gateway device is authorized to receive command & control messages when it has subscribed only to commands for a specific device. The missing check involves verifying that the command target device is configured giving permission for the gateway device to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device of a certain tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of the same tenant without corresponding permissions getting checked. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=569856#c3)  Kai Hudalla [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-01-04 02:38:17 EST  ``` (In reply to Carsten Lohmann from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=569856#c2)) > Here is the CVE report data that I would suggest to be used here. > @Committers: Please comment if you like to see changes. >  > --- >  > project: Eclipse Hono >  > versions: 1.4.0, 1.5.0 >   IMHO this affects 1.4.3 and 1.4.4 as well, doesn't it?  > CWE-862: Missing Authorization >  > summary: In Eclipse Hono version 1.4.0 and 1.5.0 the AMQP and MQTT protocol > adapters do not check whether an authenticated gateway device is authorized > to receive command & control messages when it has subscribed only to > commands for a specific device.

Okay. I'll resolve this as FIXED.  > @Wayne, are we supposed/entitled to close security issues like this one once > we have resolved it and published a fix?  This is a bit of a grey area. If the issue is being used to track the resolution of the issue, then I tend to expect that the reporter or project team will close it. If the issue is only being used to request a CVE, then I tend to close it after the CVE has been issued. That is, there's no specific rule or well-defined process; I tend to try and take my lead from the project. ``` |  |
