Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error message within the `KERedirect` kext (kernel extension) of Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac. This error message includes sensitive information, such as kernel pointers and debug messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive kernel-level information through error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain access to kernel pointers and debug messages.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This leaked information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially escalate privileges and execute code within the kernel context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system.
- **High-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to trigger the vulnerable error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the target macOS system.
- **High Privileges:** The attacker must be able to execute code with high privileges (e.g., root/administrator) on the system. This is a pre-requisite for exploiting this specific vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (v10.x) and below.
- Trend Micro released updates (v10.5 and v10.0) via ActiveUpdate to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Cees Elzinga from Danish Cyber Defence working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
