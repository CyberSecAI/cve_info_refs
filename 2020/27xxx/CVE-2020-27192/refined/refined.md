{
  "CVE-2020-27192": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in Forklift <=3.3.9 and <=3.4 on macOS, caused by the application's entitlement to disable library validation, which allows for dylib injection.",
    "Root cause": "The application and its helper process have the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement set, which disables code signature checks and allows for arbitrary dylib injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The application and its helper process use the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement, which weakens the security of the application by allowing any dylib to be loaded.",
      "The XPC helper service does not properly authorize callers, relying on the application's signature which is bypassed by dylib injection."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation from user to root. An attacker can gain root access by injecting a malicious dylib into the Forklift application, which can then communicate with the XPC helper to perform privileged actions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Local exploitation via dylib injection at load time of the Forklift application.",
        "The injected dylib can communicate with the XPC helper to perform privileged operations without proper authorization."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target macOS system, inject a dylib into the Forklift application, and understand how to communicate with the XPC helper."
