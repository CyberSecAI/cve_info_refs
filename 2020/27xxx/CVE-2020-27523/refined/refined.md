Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Solstice-Pod Gen2i (version 5.0.2) does not properly handle format string specifiers when processing the screen key input during user connection attempts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The system fails to sanitize or properly handle format string specifiers (e.g., "%x") in the screen key field. This allows an attacker to inject format strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting format string specifiers causes the Solstice-Pod to reboot, disrupting its normal operation and resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The reboot takes around 20-30 seconds.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by connecting to the Solstice-Pod through a web browser.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed without any prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Solstice-Pod web interface.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept the request containing the screen key and modify it by injecting format strings. This can be achieved by using a proxy tool such as BurpSuite.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "Kevin2600"
- The vendor, Mersive, was contacted and confirmed the bug and stated a fix will be in version 5.2.
- According to the provided content, there are over 17,000 vulnerable devices publicly exposed on the internet, increasing the potential impact of this vulnerability.
- The attack involves intercepting the HTTP request, typically via a proxy like Burp Suite, to modify the screen key with a format string.
