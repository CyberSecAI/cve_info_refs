Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the "Groupname" parameter in the DynPG admin panel. Specifically, the application allows users to inject JavaScript code within this field.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. This means that the injected script is stored on the server (in this case, likely a database) and is executed whenever a user views the affected page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This allows for a range of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking and cookie theft.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (if they are logged in).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Texts" section of the admin panel. A user with the ability to access this section can inject the malicious script into the `NEW_GROUP_NAME` field, which is then saved by the application. The payload is delivered through a POST request to `/index.php?show=4` with the malicious code within the "NEW_GROUP_NAME" parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have valid login credentials for the DynPG administration panel.
    *   The attacker must be able to access the "Texts" section within the admin panel.
