Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the Loginizer plugin for WordPress. This flaw exists because the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the username, during login attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize the username field before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The Loginizer plugin doesn't sanitize user-provided usernames when recording failed login attempts, allowing the injection of SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to complete control of the WordPress website and its database.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive data stored within the database.
- **Website Takeover:** The attacker can modify data, create admin accounts, or perform other malicious actions, ultimately taking full control of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed Username:** The attacker crafts a special username containing SQL statements, during the login process.
- **Login Attempt:** The attacker attempts to log in using this crafted username.
- **Database Interaction:** The Loginizer plugin records the failed login attempt, including the malformed username, into the WordPress database without sanitizing the input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any prior access or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send requests to the WordPress site's login page.
- **Basic Command-Line Skills:** As indicated, an attacker with basic command-line skills can execute the exploit, which demonstrates its simplicity.
