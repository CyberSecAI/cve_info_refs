Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-27258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the communication protocol of the insulin pump and its mobile applications (AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A) having insufficiently protected credentials. Specifically, the pump's keypad lock PIN can be extracted by unauthenticated attackers via Bluetooth Low Energy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract the pump's keypad lock PIN.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the device, potentially enabling further malicious actions, though the immediate impact is primarily information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- Attackers need to be in physical proximity to the vulnerable device (adjacent network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth range of the insulin pump.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

- The affected products include: Dana Diabecare RS (all versions prior to 3.0), AnyDana-i (all versions prior to 3.0), and AnyDana-A (all versions prior to 3.0).
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 6.5. The CVSS vector string is (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
