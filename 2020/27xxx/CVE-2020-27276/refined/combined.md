The communication protocol of the insulin pump and its AnyDana-i and AnyDana-A mobile applications does not use adequate measures to authenticate the communicating entities before exchanging keys, which allows unauthenticated, physically proximate attackers to eavesdrop the authentication sequence via Bluetooth Low Energy.

[CVE-2020-27276](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27276) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Healthcare and Public Health
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Europe, Asia
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** South Korea

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Julian Suleder, Birk Kauer, Raphael Pavlidis, and Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI, Germany), in the context of the BSI project ManiMed – Manipulation of Medical Devices. BSI then provided this report to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Dana Diabecare recommends users update the Dana Diabecare insulin pumps to Version 3.0 or higher, or to the latest available release. Additionally, users are encouraged to immediately update AnyDana-A and AnyDana-i to Version 3.0 or higher. Also, SOOIL recommends users to apply these mitigating strategies:

* In the case a user cannot update the Dana RS pump to the latest version, always operate the pump in Airplane Mode.
* Users of any versions prior to 3.0 should operate Dana RS insulin pumps in Airplane Mode continuously.
* Users can obtain partial mitigation of the vulnerabilities by updating the AnyDana application to the latest Version 3.0 or later.
* Users of the latest version of the application, Version 3.0 or later, can continue to operate the Dana RS insulin pumps with versions installed prior to Version 3.0.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Maintain tight physical control of the pump and devices connected to the pump.
* Be attentive to pump notifications, alarms, and alerts be aware of anything out of the ordinary.
* Immediately cancel any unintended boluses (a single dose of insulin administered all at once).
* Do not connect insulin pump to any third-party devices or use any software not authorized.
* Get medical help immediately if you suspect any insulin pump settings or the insulin delivery has changed unexpectedly.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
