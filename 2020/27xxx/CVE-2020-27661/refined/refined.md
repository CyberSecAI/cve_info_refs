  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2020-27661",
      "root_cause": "A divide-by-zero vulnerability exists in the `dwc2_handle_packet()` function within the DWC2 USB host controller emulation in QEMU. The `HCCHAR_MPS` value, which is guest-controllable, is used as a divisor without a sanity check. If the guest sets it to zero, it causes a division by zero, crashing the QEMU process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
         "Divide by Zero"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious or buggy guest operating system can crash the QEMU process on the host machine, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "A malicious guest OS sets the HCCHAR_MPS to 0"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control the guest OS to set the `HCCHAR_MPS` register value.",
        "remediation": "The vulnerability is fixed by adding a check for a zero value in `HCCHAR_MPS` before it is used as divisor."
