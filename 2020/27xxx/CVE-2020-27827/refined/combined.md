| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-01-28 02:01:25 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-01-28 02:01:29 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1921438,1921441  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c2)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 16:11:30 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c3)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-30 17:51:10 UTC  ``` Fedora 33 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2021-11-30. Fedora 33 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c4)  David Sastre Medina    2022-01-13 15:23:47 UTC  ``` I have submitted a PR to update to 1.0.13 to address [CVE-2020-27827](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27827) and [CVE-2021-43612](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-43612)  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/lldpd/pull-request/6>  <https://lldpd.github.io/security.html> for reference.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1921441#c5)  Ben Cotton    2022-02-08 21:12:10 UTC  ``` This bug appears to have been reported against 'rawhide' during the Fedora 36 development cycle.

Description
===========

Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to denial of service
attacks in which crafted LLDP packets could cause memory to be lost
when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs.  Triggering the
vulnerability requires LLDP processing to be enabled for a specific
port.  Open vSwitch versions before 2.5.x are not vulnerable.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
previously assigned the identifier CVE-2020-27827 to this issue for
the `lldpd` project, and the Open vSwitch project.

Mitigation
==========

For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing LLDP packets from
reaching Open vSwitch mitigates the vulnerability.  We do not recommend
attempting to mitigate the vulnerability this way because of the
following difficulties:

    - Open vSwitch obtains packets before the iptables host firewall,
      so ebtables on the Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the
      vulnerability.

    - If Open vSwitch is configured to receive and transmit LLDP
      messages, the required functionality will need to be disabled
      potentially disrupting the network.

We have found that Open vSwitch is subject to a denial of service
exploit when LLDP processing is enabled on an interface.  By default,
interfaces are not configured to process LLDP messages.

Recommendation
==============

We recommend that users of Open vSwitch apply the included patch, or
upgrade to a known patched version of Open vSwitch.  These include:

* 2.14.1
* 2.13.2
* 2.12.2
* 2.11.5
* 2.10.6
* 2.9.8
* 2.8.10
* 2.7.12
* 2.6.9

Acknowledgments
===============

The Open vSwitch team wishes to thank the reporter:

  Jonas Rudloff <[jonas.t.rudloff at gmail.com](https://mail.openvswitch.org/mailman/listinfo/ovs-dev)>

Fix:

The patch to resolve this issue is attached.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 38 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Add FORTIFY\_SOURCE=3](/wiki/Changes/Add_FORTIFY_SOURCE%3D3_to_distribution_build_flags "Changes/Add FORTIFY SOURCE=3 to distribution build flags")
* [fno-omit-frame-pointer](/wiki/Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer "Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer")
* [Perl replace MODULE\_COMPAT by generator](/wiki/Changes/Perl_replace_MODULE_COMPAT_by_generator "Changes/Perl replace MODULE COMPAT by generator")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, January 18th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f38
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f38. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f38 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f38
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on Libera.CHAT IRC.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1921438#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2021-01-28 02:00:58 UTC  ``` Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to denial of service attacks in which crafted LLDP packets could cause memory to be lost when allocating data to handle specific optional TLVs.  Triggering the vulnerability requires LLDP processing to be enabled for a specific port.  Open vSwitch versions before 2.5.x are not vulnerable.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC CP 1243-8 IRC communications processors connect SIMATIC S7-1200 controllers via the
SINAUT ST7 telecontrol protocol to a control center or master ST7 stations.

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 and SIMATIC CP 1545-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500
controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption. The communication processor pro-
tects S7-1500 stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conﬁdentiality of transmitted
data.

SIMATIC CP 1243-1 communications processors connect S7-1200 controllers to Ethernet networks. They
provide integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other
protocols with data encryption.

The SIMATIC CP 1543SP-1, CP 1542SP-1 and CP 1542SP-1 IRC communication processors connect
the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks. It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall,
Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support of other protocols with data encryption.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
