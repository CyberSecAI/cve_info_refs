Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Settings application. Specifically, the issue resides in the `SimSelectNotification` component of the Settings app. The commit message indicates that the patch addresses a missing "setPackage" for PendingIntent in SimSelectNotification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The vulnerability is categorized as an Information Disclosure (ID). The primary weakness is that a `PendingIntent` within `SimSelectNotification` lacked the necessary `setPackage` method. This could lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact is rated as moderate. While the specifics of the information disclosure are not detailed here, the core issue seems to stem from insecure handling of intents when selecting a SIM card, which could expose some type of data to an unauthorized third party. 

**Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could leverage this flaw by crafting a malicious application to intercept or receive the improperly handled intent associated with SIM card selection, leading to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need to have an application installed on the device, and be able to trigger the relevant intent in order to exploit the vulnerability.
