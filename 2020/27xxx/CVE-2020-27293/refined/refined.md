  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of DPA files by the DOPSoft program due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which leads to a type confusion condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion due to improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DPA files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious DPA file in the DOPSoft program.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the target user open a malicious DPA file. This requires some form of social engineering or other method to get the user to open the file."
