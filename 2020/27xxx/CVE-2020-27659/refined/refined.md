Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27659:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `request.cgi` script of the Synology Safe Access package. Specifically, the `domain` parameter from the HTTP GET request is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of proper sanitization of the (1) `domain` parameter and (2) `profile` parameter in the Safe Access application.
    - Specifically, the domain parameter is reflected in the Safe Access activity log and reports pages.
    - The profile name is also not sanitized before being inserted into the page.
    - This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    - The `domain` parameter in `request.cgi` is directly used in a SQLite query without proper escaping or parameterization.
    - This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **XSS:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes when an administrator views the Safe Access activity logs or reports.
    - Using the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can:
      - Steal the administrator's session cookie.
      - Change the administrator's password.
      - Enable SSH access to gain remote access to the router as root.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing:
      - Reading or modifying data in the SQLite database
      - Accessing internal directories
      - Downloading accessible files through File Station.
        - In the provided content, it's used to modify the `fbsharing.db` database to expose internal directories and download files.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **XSS:**
    - The attacker must induce a user to visit a blocked website, causing a request to be sent via `request.cgi`.
    - The administrator must then view the Safe Access activity log or reports page where the malicious script is rendered.
    - Alternatively, the attacker can also use the profile parameter to achieve the same result.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `request.cgi` with a malicious `domain` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **XSS:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to trigger a request for a blocked domain by a user.
    - The attacker needs to trick the administrator into visiting a vulnerable page in the Safe Access web interface.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Synology router's web interface (adjacent network access).

**Additional Details:**

-   The `httpd` server runs as root, which allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root if they manage to exploit the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability exists in Synology SafeAccess before version 1.2.3-0234.
- The exploit requires the SafeAccess Package installed and a profile with a web filter defined.
- The Talos report provides a proof-of-concept exploit that changes the profile name to include a javascript payload that steals the administrator's session cookie.
- The Github repository provides detailed steps on exploiting both XSS and SQL injection.
- It is possible to chain the SQL injection with XSS, stealing the session cookie and gaining control of the router.

**Summary of CVE-2020-27659:**

CVE-2020-27659 is related to a Stored XSS vulnerability found in Synology SafeAccess before version 1.2.3-0234 which can allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) domain or (2) profile parameter. Combined with the SQL Injection (CVE-2020-27660), it could result in an attacker achieving remote code execution on the device as root.
