Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability, CVE-2020-27576:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and encoding of folder names within the Rumpus web application. Specifically, double quotes in the folder name are not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows users to create folders with names containing HTML and JavaScript. This malicious code is stored and executed each time the folder is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser when the folder is viewed. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** The XSS vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities like command injection (CVE-2020-27575), allowing an attacker to gain root access by executing arbitrary commands on the server, if an administrator interacts with the crafted folder name.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious folder name:** An attacker creates a folder with a crafted name containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **User interaction:** When another user views the folder in the Rumpus web interface, the stored XSS payload executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs an account on the Rumpus server.
*  **Knowledge of Application Weakness:** The attacker needs to know that the application does not properly sanitize folder names.

**Additional details:**
*   The content provides a specific example of the XSS payload within a folder name: `FolderName=%22+onmouseover%3D%22alert%281%29`.
*   The content describes how the XSS can be chained with command injection to achieve Remote Code Execution(RCE)

In summary, CVE-2020-27576 is a stored XSS vulnerability within the Rumpus application that arises due to insufficient input validation, which can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve RCE.
