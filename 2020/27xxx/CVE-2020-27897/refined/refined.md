Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kernel extension (kext) when handling IOCTL (Input/Output Control) code 0x10003.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The insufficient validation of user-supplied data can lead to a write operation beyond the allocated buffer for a data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this flaw to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code within the kernel's context. This would grant them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This suggests that an initial foothold on the system is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to:
    1.  Gain initial low-privileged code execution on the targeted macOS system.
    2.  Craft specific input data for the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kext IOCTL 0x10003 that triggers the out-of-bounds write.

In summary, this vulnerability is a local privilege escalation flaw within the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kernel extension. It allows an attacker with low-privilege access to escalate to kernel-level privileges by exploiting an out-of-bounds write caused by insufficient validation of user-supplied data.
