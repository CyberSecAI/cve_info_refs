The provided content relates to CVE-2020-27790.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A crafted input file can cause a division-by-zero error in the `PackLinuxElf64::invert_pt_dynamic` function, specifically at line 5108 of `p_lx_elf.cpp`. This occurs when calculating `symnum_end`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code lacks proper input validation or sanitization that leads to a division-by-zero error. The value of `sz_sym`, which is used as the divisor, can be zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation leads to a crash due to a SIGFPE (Floating-Point Exception), making the UPX tool unusable for the crafted input.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can provide a specially crafted ELF file as input to the UPX tool that triggers the division-by-zero error in the `invert_pt_dynamic` function during the packing process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ELF file to the UPX tool as input. No specific privileges are required.
