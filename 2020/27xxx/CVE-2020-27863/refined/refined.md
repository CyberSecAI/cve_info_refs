  "CVE-2020-27863": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of D-Link DVA-2800 and DSL-2888A routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the dhttpd service, which listens on TCP port 8008 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect string matching logic within the dhttpd service when accessing protected pages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Lack of path sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information, specifically stored credentials, which can lead to further compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent attacks targeting the dhttpd service (TCP port 8008).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Network-adjacent access. No authentication is required."
