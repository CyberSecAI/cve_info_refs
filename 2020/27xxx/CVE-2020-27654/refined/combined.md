# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1065

## Synology SRM lbd service Command Execution Vulnerability

##### October 29, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-27654, CVE-2020-11117

### Summary

An exploitable command execution vulnerability exists in the lbd service functionality of Qualcomm lbd 1.1, as present in Synology SRM 1.2.3 RT2600ac 8017-5. A specially crafted debug command can overwrite arbitrary files with controllable content, resulting in remote code execution. An attacker can send an unauthenticated message to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Qualcomm lbd 1.1

Synology SRM 1.2.3 RT2600ac 8017-5

### Product URLs

<https://www.synology.com/en-global/srm>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.6 - CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-73 - External Control of File Name or Path

### Details

Synology Router Manager (SRM) is a Linux-based operating system for Synology Routers developed by Synology.

SRM ships a binary called “Qualcomm Load Balancing Daemon” (`lbd`), which is used for monitoring and debugging a load-balancing feature in the WiFi interfaces. This service can be managed via network, and there are two instances of it running at the same time, one for the main WiFi (port 7787) and one for the guest WiFi (port 7786). The two instances are configured in the exact same way, except for the interface they manage. Both ports are reachable via LAN.

The service has no authentication and shows a menu:

```
$ nc 192.168.1.1 7786
Use `h' and `help' for help messages
Use `dbg here' to see log messages; other dbg cmds for log level
@

```

In the `dbg` menu, there’s an option to “redirect” debug output to a file.

```
@ dbg h
h [cmd] -- short help (first line of each help message).
help [cmd] -- long help.
q -- quit interactive menu
s -- print dbg status
level [{<module>|all} [[=] {err|info|debug|dump}] -- print/change module debug level
here [-off] -- copy debug messages to current shell context
redirect {[-a] <path>} | -off -- redirect dbg messages to file

```

An attacker could connect to this port, enable debug output to a file, and influence it in a way that interpretable output gets written to executable files, in order to execute arbitrary code without authentication. Any command executed this way would be run as the root user:

```
SynologyRouter> ps |grep [l]bd
29380 root      3032 S    /usr/sbin/lbd -C /usr/syno/etc/wifi/lbd.conf -P 7787
29997 root      3036 S    /usr/sbin/lbd -C /usr/syno/etc/wifi/lbd.guest.conf -P 7786

```

Note that, while this service is normally reachable only within LAN, because of the issues described in TALOS-2020-1064 and TALOS-2020-1066, this service is exploitable also from the QuickConnect network, allowing a non-authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root in any device connected to the QuickConnect VPN.

### Timeline

2020-05-04 - Vendor disclosure to Synology and Qualcomm

2020-06-02 - Disclosure release deadline requested and Talos extended to 2020-09-30

2020-06-22 - 2nd extension requested; disclosure extended to 2020-10-30

2020-07-09 - Vendor (Qualcomm) assigned CVE-2020-11117

2020-08-28 - Vendor (Qualcomm) confirmed patch

2020-10-29 - Public Release

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1064

## Synology QuickConnect servers network misconfiguration vulnerability

##### October 29, 2020

### Summary

An exploitable network misconfiguration vulnerability exists in the VPN servers of Synology QuickConnect. The server does not enforce proper subnetting, allowing an attacker to reach any device connected to the VPN. To abuse this vulnerability, the attacker needs to change their subnet.

### Tested Versions

Synology QuickConnect servers

### Product URLs

<https://quickconnect.to>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

### CWE

CWE-300 - Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint (‘Man-in-the-Middle’)

### Details

Synology QuickConnect is a service that allows users to access Synology devices (routers, NAS, etc.) remotely. This feature requires a Synology account and users have to set it up from the device’s Web interface in order to use it. The setup also requires the user to choose an arbitrary “QuickConnect ID”, which will be used as a remote identifier for the device.

This advisory has been tested against a Synology SRM RT2600ac router with the QuickConnect feature enabled.

After activation, the user is presented with a link that can be used to connect from anywhere via a browser, example: “http://QuickConnect.to/qcrouterid”, where “qcrouterid” is the previously chosen identifier. When browsing this link, the router is instructed (via a previously-established channel between router and Synology servers) to establish a VPN connection with the remote QuickConnect endpoint. At this point, requests performed by the browser will be relayed to the internal router Web interface on port 8001 by default (SSL).

The VPN connection is established using OpenVPN in client mode. Once connected, the router gets an IP address for a subnet in the 169.254.0.0/16 network:

```
SynologyRouter> ip addr
...
36: tun1000: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1400 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 100
link/none
inet 169.254.171.94/21 brd 169.254.175.255 scope global tun1000
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
...

```

The subnet in the example above is /21, however the subnet assigned is not fixed, in fact if the router re-connects to the VPN, it will be assigned an IP address in a different subnet. The assignment is made dynamically and is meant to separate the various QuickConnect connections.

In reality, the subnets are not logically split, meaning that it’s enough to change the netmask to be able to talk with any other router connected to the same VPN.

As an example, an attacker connects to the VPN and gets an IP in a different subnet:

```
# openvpn --client --mute-replay-warnings --auth-nocache --nobind --tun-mtu 1400 --ping-exit 10 --connect-retry-max 3 --proto udp --remote [quickconnect_ip] --port 443 --dev tun1000 --ca synology_ca.crt --script-security 2 --auth-user-pass /tmp/quickconnect_openvpn_auth --remap-usr1 SIGTERM --cipher none --comp-lzo adaptive --reneg-sec 0 --verb 5 --allow-recursive-routing --route-up /etc/openvpn/up.sh

# ip route | grep 169
169.254.136.0/21 dev tun1000 proto kernel scope link src 169.254.143.54

```

Note that the attacker’s IP is in a different subnet than the victim router and so it can’t reach it:

```
# ping -c1 -w1 169.254.171.94
PING 169.254.171.94 (169.254.171.94) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 169.254.171.94 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms

```

However, by enlarging the netmask the victim router becomes reachable:

```
# ifconfig tun1000 netmask 255.255.0.0
# ping -c1 -w1 169.254.171.94
PING 169.254.171.94 (169.254.171.94) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 169.254.171.94: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=45.3 ms

--- 169.254.171.94 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 45.296/45.296/45.296/0.000 ms

```

An attacker can thus scan the whole 169.254.0.0/24 subnet to discover new routers and possibly chain other attacks, as shown in TALOS-2020-1066 and TALOS-2020-1065. In fact, chaining these three issues together would allow a non-authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root in any router connected to the QuickConnect VPN.

Note that an attacker could enter the QuickConnect VPN either by simply owning a router and connecting to it via SSH, or, alternatively, using the bug described in TALOS-2020-1058.
