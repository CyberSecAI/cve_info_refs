Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Snapcraft including the current working directory (CWD) in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable when building snap packages, specifically those with the `home` plug enabled. This occurs when an environment variable is empty, resulting in two successive colons `::` in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which is then interpreted by the dynamic linker `ld` to include the CWD as a library search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` Generation:** Snapcraft improperly handles empty environment variables, resulting in a flawed `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` that includes the CWD, thus creating a potential for library injection.
- **Library Injection Vulnerability:** The inclusion of CWD in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` allows a malicious actor to place a crafted library (e.g., a malicious `libc.so.6`) in the CWD and have it loaded by a snap application instead of the legitimate system library. This gives the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the snap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution within Snap Container:** A malicious library loaded from the CWD grants an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code within the snap's container.
- **Potential for Container Escape:** If the exploited snap has plugs like `x11`, an attacker can further leverage the code execution within the snap to interact with the host system.
- **Cross-Snap Exploitation:** A malicious snap with the `home` interface can be used to create a malicious library in the user's home directory, which can then be exploited by another snap run from the same directory.
- **Impact on Popular Snaps:**  The vulnerability impacts numerous snaps that utilize the `home` plug, increasing the scope of potential attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Downloads:** An attacker could create a malicious archive (e.g., a `.tar.gz` file) containing a crafted library, and trick a user into extracting it and running a vulnerable snap application from within that directory.
- **Compromised Source Repositories:** An attacker could insert a malicious library into a project's directory, leading to code execution if a snap is built within this location.
- **Cross-Snap Attacks**: A malicious snap could write a crafted library to the user's home directory to target another snap application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Create Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious library, such as `libc.so.6`.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into running a vulnerable snap application from a directory containing the malicious library.
-   **Home Plug Requirement:** The targeted snap needs to use the `home` plug, or similar interface that has access to the filesystem where the malicious library is located.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that Snapcraft does not export empty environment variables when constructing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This prevents the inclusion of `::` which triggers the CWD being added to the library search path.
