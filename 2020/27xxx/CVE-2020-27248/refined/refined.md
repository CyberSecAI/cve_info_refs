Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-27248:

**Vulnerability Description:**

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in SoftMaker Office PlanMaker's handling of Microsoft Office Art records within Excel documents. Specifically, when parsing a record of type 0xf150 inside an `OfficeArtDggContainer` record (type 0xf000), the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` method copies data from the document stream into a fixed-size buffer. The size of the copy is determined by a length field in the record header, which is not properly validated, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking on the record's length field within the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` function when handling record type 0xf150, particularly when the Version/Instance field is set to 0x0003 or 0x0014. The code uses the length to determine the amount of data to copy into a statically sized buffer without verifying the length against the buffer size. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when the provided length is larger than the available buffer.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to heap corruption, which can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted Microsoft Excel document (.xls) file. An attacker can entice a victim to open a malicious Excel document using SoftMaker Office PlanMaker.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Microsoft Excel file with a specific structure containing an `MsoDrawingGroup` record (type 0x00eb), an `OfficeArtDggContainer` record (type 0xf000), and within that, an 0xf150 record with a crafted Version/Instance field of 0x0003 or 0x0014. The attacker also needs to control the length field in the header to cause the overflow. The attacker needs to entice a user to open the malicous document.

**Technical Details (Specific to CVE-2020-27248):**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` method when handling a record type 0xf150.
- The function reads a `uint32` length from the record header, and uses it to copy data into a fixed size buffer at offset 0x99c of the 0x8b18 object
- The size of the buffer at offset 0x99c is believed to be 0x40 bytes.
- The vulnerability occurs when the version/instance field is 0x0003 or 0x0014, and the length value from the header is greater than 0x40.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document also discusses other similar heap overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-27247, CVE-2020-27249, CVE-2020-27250, and CVE-2020-28587) that occur within the same function by overflowing other buffers in the same object, with different sizes and offsets.
- The provided crash information and debugging steps give information about how to trigger the vulnerability and observe the buffer overflow through a debugger.
