Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an algorithm downgrade issue in the QuickConnect feature of Synology SRM. Specifically, the OpenVPN client used for QuickConnect communication is configured with `--cipher none`, which means that VPN data channel packets are not encrypted. Although the SRM web interface is normally accessed over HTTPS, an attacker can force a downgrade to HTTP, exposing sensitive information in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Algorithm Downgrade:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to downgrade the secure HTTPS connection to an insecure HTTP connection. This is facilitated by the initial attempt to connect to a fake OpenVPN server causing the subsequent connection to fall back to HTTP.
*   **Unencrypted VPN Traffic:** The usage of `--cipher none` in the OpenVPN client configuration results in the VPN traffic being transmitted in plaintext, between router and QuickConnect servers, making it susceptible to eavesdropping via man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Lack of HTTPS enforcement:** The web interface does not force HTTPS communication when accessed through the QuickConnect service, allowing the downgrade to HTTP.
*   **No Secure Flag on Session Cookie:** Although not directly part of this vulnerability, the provided information highlights another vulnerability (CVE-2020-27651) that lacks the "Secure" flag on session cookies, which exacerbates the problem by making it easier to capture the cookies when the connection is downgraded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can capture the plaintext traffic, including sensitive information such as session cookies.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The stolen session cookies can be used to gain unauthorized access to the Synology router's web interface, allowing an attacker to control the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned between the router and the QuickConnect servers to intercept and manipulate the traffic. This can be achieved by controlling the network path or by ARP poisoning or DNS spoofing.
*   **Fake OpenVPN Server:** The attacker sets up a malicious OpenVPN server to force the downgrade of the connection.
*   **Traffic Redirection:** The attacker redirects traffic to the fake OpenVPN server initially and then to the legitimate server once the downgrade is achieved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker must be able to perform a MitM attack, requiring control over the network path between the router and the Synology servers or ability to spoof/redirect the traffic using techniques like ARP poisoning or DNS spoofing.
*   **Fake OpenVPN Server Setup:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a fake OpenVPN server to initially intercept the connection.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to intercept and redirect network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when both "redirect HTTP to HTTPS" and "Enable HSTS" options are disabled on the router (default configuration).
*   The attack works even if the user connects to the router directly through a previously generated URL (e.g. via page refresh).
*   The vulnerability is present in Synology SRM versions prior to 1.2.4-8081
*   Synology DSM 6.2.3 25426 is also affected (confirmed by vendor)
