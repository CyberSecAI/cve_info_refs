  "CVE-2020-27199": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities found in the Magic Home Pro Mobile Application which is used to interface with the JadeHomic LED Strip RGB Kit. The most significant of these vulnerabilities is an Authentication Bypass (CVE-2020-27199) vulnerability, which ultimately allows for full takeover and control of a victims' entire device group.",
    "Root cause": "The application is susceptible to device takeover by an attacker through use of the remote API call to **/app/shareDevice/ZG001** and utilising the **friendUserID** JSON parameter to add the device to the attackers device list, giving the attacker full control of the endpoint device.  Also, the application uses 'None' as the algorithm in the JWT header section which allows for signature bypass.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Unauthorized Access",
       "Horizontal Privilege Escalation",
	   "JWT signature bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows for an the authentication bypass of the Magic Home Pro Mobile application and thus full control of a victim users' entire device group.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Authenticated user required",
      "Successful Enumeration of existing end system",
      "Subsequent sending of batch commands to an remote endpoint",
      "Device take over",
      "Authentication Bypass"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests/responses from the application to the API endpoint and have a registered account to perform some of the attacks. Also needs to be able to intercept/capture network traffic.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "An attacker can enumerate user data, including user IDs and device IDs, by fuzzing MAC addresses using the API endpoint **/app/getBindedUserListByMacAddress/ZG001?macAddress=<mac address>**.",
      "Once the target user data is acquired, the attacker can forge a JWT token using the gleaned 'userID' and 'uniID' to bypass the token signature by setting the algorithm to 'None'.",
      "The forged JWT is used in a subsequent API call to **/app/shareDevice/ZG001** to add the target's device to the attacker's account using the **friendUserID** parameter.",
	  "Once the device is added to the attackers account the attacker has full control of the target endpoint device.",
      "It's also possible to control the devices by using a POST request to **/app/sendCommandBatch/ZG001** using the device's MAC address along with hex commands **71230fa3** (ON) or **71240fa4** (OFF)."
