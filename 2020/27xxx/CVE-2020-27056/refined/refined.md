**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability was that a constraint for getting app data directories was inadvertently omitted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of access to app data directories. The omission of a constraint allowed unintended access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure. The missing constraint could potentially lead to access of app private data, that should not be accessible from other processes or apps. It is described as a moderate level vulnerability.
The commit message mentions that a test app can no longer call stat(). While that is a direct effect of the fix, the underlying vulnerability is the improper access control.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious application that attempts to access the private data directories of other applications. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have a malicious application installed on the device with the capability to try to access the app data directories. No elevated permissions are specified in the description to be needed for the exploitation.
