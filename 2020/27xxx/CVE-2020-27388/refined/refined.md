Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27388:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The YOURLS admin panel does not properly sanitize plugin file headers before displaying them, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within plugin metadata fields (Plugin Name, Plugin URI, Description, Version, Author, Author URI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious code is stored within the application database (or file system) via a malicious plugin, and is executed when an admin user views the plugin management page.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The YOURLS application fails to adequately sanitize plugin metadata fields, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The admin panel does not properly encode plugin metadata before rendering them in HTML, thus enabling the execution of injected JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript designed to steal admin session cookies or credentials, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can inject code to present a fake login prompt, tricking the admin into divulging their credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Plugin Modification:** An authenticated user must create or modify a YOURLS plugin file (`plugin.php`) and include malicious XSS payloads within the plugin header.
*   **Admin Panel Access:**  The vulnerability is triggered when a YOURLS admin user views the "Manage Plugins" page, where the malicious plugin metadata is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker needs a valid user account with administrative privileges to upload and activate malicious plugins.
*   **File Access:** Ability to create a malicious plugin file and upload it to the server filesystem.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in YOURLS versions 1.5 to 1.7.10.
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept code snippet demonstrating the XSS injection within the plugin metadata and a proof-of-concept plugin to bypass authentication by hooking into `shunt_is_valid_user` function which is not a vulnerability itself but demonstrates how malicious plugin can hook into the application.
*   The vulnerability was reported by John Jackson of Johnjhacking and Lost Rabbit Labs.
