Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of serialized objects provided to the `EventCoordinator` endpoint within Qognify Ocularis. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data which leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the application's failure to properly validate and sanitize serialized data before deserialization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Qognify Ocularis installation.
- **SYSTEM Context:** The attacker can achieve code execution with the privileges of the SYSTEM user, granting them complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, allowing for remote exploitation.
- **EventCoordinator Endpoint:** The specific attack vector involves sending crafted serialized objects to the `EventCoordinator` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication to the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Qognify Ocularis server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor (Qognify) has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-07-14 and publicly disclosed on 2020-12-29.
