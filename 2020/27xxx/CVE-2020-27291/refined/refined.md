Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XLS files within the DOPSoft application, which is part of the CNCSoft-B software suite. This lack of validation can lead to a read operation before the start of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The vulnerability specifically involves reading data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer or data structure. This occurs during the parsing of XLS files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking the target user into opening a specially crafted malicious XLS file.
* **User Interaction Required:** The user must interact with the malicious file or a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** While the advisory mentions "remote attackers", the CVSS vector indicates Local access is required (`AV:L`).
*   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs to use social engineering to get the user to open the malicious file.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The CISA advisory indicates a low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is found in Delta Industrial Automation's CNCSoft-B software, specifically when parsing XLS files within the DOPSoft application.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor by kimiya, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Delta Electronics has released an update (v1.0.0.3) to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.8, with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
* The us-cert advisory mentions that the vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
* There are other related vulnerabilities in the same product mentioned in the advisory (CVE-2020-27287, CVE-2020-27289, and CVE-2020-27293).
