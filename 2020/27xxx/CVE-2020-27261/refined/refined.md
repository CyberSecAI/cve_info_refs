- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the CX-Position application while parsing NCI files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious NCI file or visits a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to create a malicious NCI file or host a malicious page, and then rely on user interaction to trigger the vulnerability by opening the file or visiting the page.
