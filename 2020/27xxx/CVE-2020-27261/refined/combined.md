## Omron CX-One NCI File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-183ZDI-CAN-11808

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-27261](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27261) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Omron](https://www.omron.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | CX-One |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Omron CX-One. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of NCI files by the CX-Position application. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Omron has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-09-04 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2021-02-10 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
