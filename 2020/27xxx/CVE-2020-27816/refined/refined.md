Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `elasticsearch-operator` in OpenShift Container Platform does not properly validate the namespace where Kibana logging resources are created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of namespace validation when creating Kibana resources.
- The `elasticsearch-operator` recreates console links based on new Custom Resources (CR) for new Kibana resources.
- The original console link is not restored when a rogue Kibana resource is removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary URL redirection: An attacker could create a malicious Kibana resource in a non-`openshift-logging` namespace, causing the cluster logging Kibana console link to redirect to a URL of their choice.
- Damage to the OpenShift cluster logging console link: The legitimate Kibana console link can be overwritten, and the original link will be lost if the malicious resource is removed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Creation of a malicious Kibana resource in a namespace other than `openshift-logging`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create Kibana resources within the OpenShift cluster. This implies they need a certain level of access and permissions within the cluster.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability arises from the `elasticsearch-operator`'s failure to restrict Kibana resource creation to the appropriate namespace. This allows an attacker to manipulate the cluster's logging console link by creating a rogue Kibana resource, potentially leading to arbitrary URL redirection or loss of the original console link.
