Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the NFC (Near Field Communication) subsystem. Specifically, it involves a lack of proper permission checks within the `getRadioAccessFamily` API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is categorized as an Information Disclosure (ID). The absence of sufficient permission validation for the `getRadioAccessFamily` API could expose sensitive information to unauthorized entities or processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information, though the content does not clarify the type of information leaked.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves interaction with the vulnerable `getRadioAccessFamily` API within the NFC subsystem. This likely means an attacker would need to be able to trigger this function call on an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would require the capability to make calls to the `getRadioAccessFamily` API. This may necessitate a malicious application installed on the device or the exploitation of other vulnerabilities to gain sufficient access.

**Additional Details:**
The information provided by the git commit logs indicates the following:
1.  A commit (`fe53fef3a8fe2aaedb5306f926e7346caf94caa8`) addresses the issue, specifically in the `system/nfc` component of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
2.  A related bug is mentioned: 150857259, which might be the original issue being fixed.
3.  The fix includes a check on the system's permissions before allowing access to the `getRadioAccessFamily` API.
4.  Another related commit log mentions preventing an out of bounds read in `nfc_ncif_proc_get_routing` which might be a related issue but not the main cause of CVE-2020-27033

The information provided does give a good understanding of the vulnerability and its fix, going beyond the basic description often found in CVE entries.
