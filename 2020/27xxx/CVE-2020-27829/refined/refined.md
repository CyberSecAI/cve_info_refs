Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow located in the `coders/tiff.c` file of ImageMagick.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The code allocates memory on the heap for processing TIFF image data. An error in calculating the required buffer size or how data is written to it leads to a buffer overflow. Specifically, the allocation size for `strip_pixels` is not large enough when `image->columns` is excessively large, potentially causing a write out of bounds in `memset`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Program Crash:** The heap buffer overflow can cause a program crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Denial of Service:**  A crash can lead to a denial of service, making the affected application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF Image:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the vulnerable ImageMagick code for processing. This could be through a web application, email attachment, or any other means where ImageMagick is used to process user-provided TIFF files.
*  The attacker does not need any specific privileges or be in any particular position to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided commit `6ee5059cd3ac8d82714a1ab1321399b88539abf0` on GitHub is the upstream patch that fixes the vulnerability. The fix addresses the memory allocation size for `strip_pixels`.
*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry [1922525](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1922525) tracks the vulnerability and links to the upstream patch and other related bugs. It also mentions the affected versions of ImageMagick.
*   The vulnerability is described as a medium severity issue by Red Hat.
