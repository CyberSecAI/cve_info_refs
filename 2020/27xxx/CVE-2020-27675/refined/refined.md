{
  "CVE-2020-27675": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel event channel handling code doesn't defend the handling of an event against the same event channel being removed in parallel. This can result in accesses to already freed memory areas or NULL pointer dereferences in the event handling code, leading to misbehaviour of the system or even crashes.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel event channel handling code lacks proper synchronization to prevent race conditions when an event channel is removed while it is being handled.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free",
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by sending events for a paravirtualized device while simultaneously reconfiguring it. This could lead to a denial of service (crash) in dom0.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious guest sending events for a paravirtualized device",
      "Simultaneous reconfiguration of the paravirtualized device"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "A malicious guest with the ability to send events and reconfigure paravirtualized devices in a Xen environment."
