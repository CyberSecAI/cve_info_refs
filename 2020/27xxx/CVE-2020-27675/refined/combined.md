            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27671 / XSA-346
                              version 3

                  undue deferral of IOMMU TLB flushes

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

To efficiently change the physical to machine address mappings of a
larger range of addresses for fully virtualized guests, Xen contains
an optimization to coalesce per-page IOMMU TLB flushes into a single,
wider flush after all adjustments have been made.  While this is fine
to do for newly introduced page mappings, the possible removal of
pages from such guests during this operation should not be "optimized"
in the same way.  This is because the (typically) final reference of
such pages is dropped before the coalesced flush, and hence the pages
may have been put to a different use even though DMA initiated by
their original owner mightstill be in progress.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data
leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege
escalation, cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.1 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

Only x86 HVM and PVH guests can leverage the vulnerability.  Arm guests
as well as x86 PV ones cannot leverage the vulnerability.

Only x86 HVM and PVH guests which have physical devices passed through
to them can leverage the vulnerability.

Only x86 HVM and PVH guests configured to not share IOMMU and CPU
page tables can leverage the vulnerability.  Sharing these page tables
is the default on capable Intel (VT-d) hardware.  On AMD hardware
sharing is not possible.  On Intel (VT-d) hardware sharing may also not
be possible, depending on hardware properties.  Whether it is possible
can be seen from the presence (or absence) of "iommu_hap_pt_share" on
the "virt_caps" line of "xl info" output.  Guests run in shadow mode
can leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid
the vulnerability.

On systems permitting page table sharing, not suppressing use of the
functionality will allow to avoid the vulnerability. This means guests
should not be run in
* shadow mode, i.e. hardware needs to be HAP (Hardware Assisted Paging)
  capable, there should not be "hap=0" in the guest's xl configuration
  file, and there should not be "hap=0" or equivalent on Xen's command
  line,
* non-shared page table mode, i.e. hardware needs to be capable of
  sharing, there should not be "passthrough=sync_pt" in the guest's xl
  configuration file, and there should not be "iommu=no-sharept" or
  equivalent on Xen's command line.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because removal of pass-through devices or their replacement by
emulated devices is a guest visible configuration change, which may lead
to re-discovery of the issue.  Similarly the possible guest
configuration changes can't be excluded to be noticeable to guests.

Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

AND: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

                              version 3

         Race condition in Linux event handler may crash dom0

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Linux kernel event channel handling code doesn't defend the
handling of an event against the same event channel being removed in
parallel.

This can result in accesses to already freed memory areas or NULL
pointer dereferences in the event handling code, leading to
misbehaviour of the system or even crashes.

IMPACT
======

A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by sending events for a
paravirtualized device while simultaneously reconfiguring it.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems with a Linux dom0 are vulnerable.

All Linux kernel versions are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jinoh Kang of Theori.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

xen/events: avoid removing an event channel while handling itToday it can happen that an event channel is being removed from the
system while the event handling loop is active. This can lead to a
race resulting in crashes or WARN() splats when trying to access the
irq\_info structure related to the event channel.
Fix this problem by using a rwlock taken as reader in the event
handling loop and as writer when deallocating the irq\_info structure.
As the observed problem was a NULL dereference in evtchn\_from\_irq()
make this function more robust against races by testing the irq\_info
pointer to be not NULL before dereferencing it.
And finally make all accesses to evtchn\_to\_irq[row][col] atomic ones
in order to avoid seeing partial updates of an array element in irq
handling. Note that irq handling can be entered only for event channels
which have been valid before, so any not populated row isn't a problem
in this regard, as rows are only ever added and never removed.
This is XSA-331.

This can cause a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated by a dom0 crash via events for an in-reconfiguration paravirtualized device, aka CID-073d0552ead5.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27672 / XSA-345
                               version 5

                x86: Race condition in Xen mapping code

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

Fix some version tags.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Xen code handling the updating of the hypervisor's own pagetables
tries to use 2MiB and 1GiB superpages as much as possible to maximize
TLB efficiency.  Some of the operations for checking and coalescing
superpages take non-negligible amount of time; to avoid potential lock
contention, this code also tries to avoid holding locks for the entire
operation.

Unfortunately, several potential race conditions were not considered;
precisely-timed guest actions could potentially lead to the code
writing to a page which has been freed (and thus potentially already
reused).

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can cause a host denial-of-service.  Data corruption
or privilege escalation cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Versions of Xen from at least 3.2 onward are affected.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Guests can only exercise the vulnerability if they have passed through
hardware devices.  Guests without passthrough configured cannot
exploit the vulnerability.

Furthermore, HVM and PVH guests can only exercise the vulnerability if
they are running in shadow mode, and only when running on VT-x capable
hardware (as opposed to SVM).  This is believed to be Intel, Centaur
and Shanghai CPUs.

MITIGATION
==========

Running all guests in HVM or PVH mode, in each case with HAP enabled,
prevent those guests from exploiting the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Hongyan Xia of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

xen/events: avoid removing an event channel while handling it

```
Today it can happen that an event channel is being removed from the
system while the event handling loop is active. This can lead to a
race resulting in crashes or WARN() splats when trying to access the
irq_info structure related to the event channel.

Fix this problem by using a rwlock taken as reader in the event
handling loop and as writer when deallocating the irq_info structure.

As the observed problem was a NULL dereference in evtchn_from_irq()
make this function more robust against races by testing the irq_info
pointer to be not NULL before dereferencing it.

And finally make all accesses to evtchn_to_irq[row][col] atomic ones
in order to avoid seeing partial updates of an array element in irq
handling. Note that irq handling can be entered only for event channels
which have been valid before, so any not populated row isn't a problem
in this regard, as rows are only ever added and never removed.

This is XSA-331.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-27670 / XSA-347
                              version 3

                  unsafe AMD IOMMU page table updates

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

AMD IOMMU page table entries are updated in a step by step manner,
without regard to them being potentially in use by the IOMMU.  Therefore
it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated
entry.  Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable
ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates.

In both case the specific outcome heavily depends on how exactly the
compiler translated the affected pieces of code.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data
leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege
escalation, cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable.

Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are
vulnerable.  Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or
without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable.

Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can
leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid
the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Amazon and Jan Beulich of
SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because removal of pass-through devices or their replacement by
emulated devices is a guest visible configuration change, which may lead
to re-discovery of the issue.

Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

AND: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2020-0427

    Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can
    lead to a use-after-free after a device is renamed.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25645

    A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE
    encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is
    configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the
    GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the
    encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.246-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

         Race condition in Linux event handler may crash dom0

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The Linux kernel event channel handling code doesn't defend the
handling of an event against the same event channel being removed in
parallel.

This can result in accesses to already freed memory areas or NULL
pointer dereferences in the event handling code, leading to
misbehaviour of the system or even crashes.

IMPACT
======

A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by sending events for a
paravirtualized device while simultaneously reconfiguring it.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems with a Linux dom0 are vulnerable.

All Linux kernel versions are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jinoh Kang of Theori.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the

Debian Bug     : 949863 968623 971058

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-19039

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    assertion failure (WARN).  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) if the panic_on_warn kernel parameter is set.

CVE-2019-19377

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19770

    The syzbot tool discovered a race condition in the block I/O
    tracer (blktrace) that could lead to a system crash.  Since
    blktrace can only be controlled by privileged users, the security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    out-of-bounds write.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0423

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could result in a use-after-free.  On systems using this driver, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28941

    Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Speakup screen
    reader subsystem.  Speakup assumed that it would only be bound to
    one terminal (tty) device at a time, but did not enforce this.  A
    local user could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.160-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
