{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) found in the `stripTags()` function of the Prototype JavaScript library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `stripTags()` function uses a regular expression that is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. Specifically, the regex `/<\w+(\s+([^\"]*\"|'[^']*'|[^>])+)?(\/)?>|<\/\w+>/gi` can lead to excessive backtracking when processing specially crafted input strings, causing the function to consume excessive CPU resources.",
      "The regular expression `/<\\w+(\\s+([^\"]*\"|'[^']*'|[^>])+)?(\\/)?>|<\\/\\w+>/gi` used in `stripTags` is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking because of nested quantifiers and alternations in the regex."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a specially crafted input string to the `stripTags()` function, leading to excessive CPU usage and potentially making the server unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is through input to the `stripTags()` function. A crafted string, designed to exploit the regex, is passed to this function.",
        "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a string with a large number of single quotes inside a tag, like `<a ''''''... >`"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `stripTags()` function. This could be through a web application that uses the Prototype library or any other application that utilizes this function.",
      "additional_details": "The provided proof of concept code demonstrates that by increasing the number of single quotes within a tag in the input string, the execution time of the `stripTags()` function increases significantly, indicating the ReDoS vulnerability. The vulnerable regex can cause catastrophic backtracking, consuming excessive resources."
