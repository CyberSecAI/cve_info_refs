Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `getAssets.jsp` page of OpenClinic GA 5.173.3. Specifically, user-supplied parameters passed through the HTTP request are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it doesn't neutralize special characters used in SQL commands. Multiple parameters are affected. In the case of CVE-2020-27236, the `compnomenclature` parameter is vulnerable.
- Vulnerable parameters include: `code`, `nomenclature`, `compnomenclature`, `description`, `serviceuid`, `serialnumber`, `assetStatus`, `componentStatus`, and `supplierUID`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code using the vulnerable parameters.
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
    - Modification or deletion of data.
    - Potential complete compromise of the database and underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/openclinic/assets/ajax/asset/getAssets.jsp` endpoint.
- The attacker sends crafted HTTP GET requests, injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters.
- For CVE-2020-27236, the vulnerable parameter is `compnomenclature`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to trigger this specific vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters and craft SQL injection payloads accordingly.

**Technical Details:**

- The `getAssets.jsp` page takes parameters from the request and uses them to create an `Asset` object.
- The `Asset` object's properties are used to build a SQL query dynamically without proper input sanitization.
- The following code snippet shows how the `compnomenclature` parameter is used in SQL query:
```
if (ScreenHelper.checkString(findItem.comment15).length() > 0) {
    sSql = sSql + " AND OC_ASSET_COMMENT15 LIKE '%" + findItem.comment15 + ";%'";
  }
```
-  The `ScreenHelper.checkString()` function does not appear to provide adequate sanitization or protection against SQL injection.

This analysis provides a detailed look into CVE-2020-27236, including its root cause, impact, attack vectors, and the necessary attacker capabilities.
