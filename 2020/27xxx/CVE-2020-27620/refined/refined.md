Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inconsistent use of `wfMessage()` calls in the Cosmos skin for MediaWiki. Specifically, some `wfMessage()` calls, which retrieve internationalized messages, were directly passed to `Html::rawElement()` without proper escaping. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. Because user-controlled data (within the i18n messages) could be rendered directly into the HTML output, an attacker could craft malicious i18n messages that would then execute arbitrary JavaScript within a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the page, potentially allowing them to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious i18n Message Injection:** An attacker would need to inject malicious content into a translatable message used by the vulnerable code. This can be done by:
    - Compromising the translation system.
    - Suggesting malicious translation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to i18n message translation:** Attackers need the ability to modify or create new entries in the i18n translation system.
- **No need to be authenticated:** If an attacker can inject a translation, the exploit would affect every user on the website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippets were located in `CosmosSocialProfile::getUserGroups()` within the Cosmos skin.
- The vulnerable lines specifically involved calls to `wfMessage()` that were not escaped before being passed to `Html::rawElement()`.
- The fix involved ensuring that all `wfMessage()` outputs were properly escaped using `Sanitizer::escapeIdForAttribute()` or using the text output mode (`->text()`).
- Patches were created and applied to the master, REL1_35, and REL1_34 branches of the `mediawiki/skins/Cosmos` repository.
