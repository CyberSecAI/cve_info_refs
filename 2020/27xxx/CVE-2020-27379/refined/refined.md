The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in Booking Core 1.7, and one of them is related to CVE-2020-27379.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not validate CSRF tokens when a request is sent using the GET method instead of POST.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- Improper handling of HTTP request methods for sensitive operations.
- Lack of CSRF token validation for GET requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover. An attacker can change the victim's email address, which can be used to reset the password, granting them full control of the account.
- Unauthorized modification of data, such as user approval, password changes, and content manipulation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a GET request with the desired changes (e.g., a new email address).
- The victim, while logged in to the application, clicks the crafted link.
- The application processes the request due to the lack of CSRF token validation on GET requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting the crafted URL.
