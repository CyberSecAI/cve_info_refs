2021-08-02 Publication

1. Vulnerability Description

SolarWinds Serv-U File Server through 15.2.1 does not correctly validate path information, allowing the disclosure of
files and directories outside of the user's home directory via a specially crafted GET request.

2. PoC

On a vulnerable Serv-U installation issue the following GET request to get a listing of files and directories above the
user's directory:

https://<serv-u host>/Web Client/?Command=List&dir=\..\*.*

The user *MUST* be locked to their directory, and only access granted must be the said directory. Directory listing
must be enabled. If any of the above is not present, the exploit will not work.

3. Solution

The vendor provides an updated version (15.2.2) which should be installed immediately.

# Serv-U File Server 15.2.2 release notes

Release date: December 21, 2020

Last updated: April 9, 2021

These release notes describe the new features, improvements, and fixed issues in Serv-U File Server 15.2.2. They also provide information about upgrades and describe workarounds for known issues.

If you are looking for previous release notes for Serv-U File Server, see [Previous Version](../previous_versions.htm) documentation.

Additional Serv-U documentation includes:

* [Serv-U Installation and Upgrade Guide](../servu_installation_guide.htm)
* [Serv-U 15.2 Administrator Guide](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/servu/Content/Servu_Administrator_Guide.htm)
* [System Requirements](../system_requirements/system_requirements.htm)
* [Getting Started with Serv-U](../servu_getting_started_guide.htm)

## New features and improvements

Serv-U 15.2.2 contains the following new features:

* Support for the following KEX algorithms (key exchange algorithms) for SSH
  + diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
  + diffie-hellman-group14-sha256
  + diffie-hellman-group16-sha512
* OpenSSL has been updated
* Periodic buffer flush interval during SFTP file upload setting added to Limits:

  To access this setting, navigate to the Limits and Settings screen for Global or Domain, and select Advanced from the Limit Type dropdown. The default is 300 seconds.
* Performance and stability improvements
* Security enhancements
* Serv-U 15.2.2 is signed with new code-signing certificate

If you upgrade from version 15.1.7 or older, 15.2.2 increases password security and automatically converts existing MD5 passwords using a more secure algorithm when users connect for the first time after upgrade.

If an account is not used within 90 days of the upgrade, access is restricted and the user will not be able to log in afterward. The administrator will be required to change their password.
