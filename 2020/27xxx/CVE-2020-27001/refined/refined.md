Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27001:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PAR files within Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.
- Specifically, the issue arises from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. When the application parses a specially crafted PAR file, it fails to validate the size of the incoming data. This leads to copying more data than the allocated buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory locations on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization application). This can potentially lead to complete control over the affected system.
- **Application Crash:** If the overflow does not lead to reliable code execution, it could crash the application leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PAR File:** The primary attack vector is a malicious PAR file crafted to contain oversized data.
- **User Interaction Required:** The victim user needs to either open the malicious file directly or visit a malicious webpage that triggers the parsing of the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PAR file to the victim. This could be done through various means, such as email attachments, malicious websites, or by planting the file on a shared network resource.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system; the user running the affected application needs to be tricked into opening the malicious file.
