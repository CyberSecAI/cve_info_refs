- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the OpenClinicMySQL service binary file within the installation directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The "Authenticated Users" group has change (write) privileges over the `mysqld.exe` service binary. This allows any authenticated user to modify the file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the service binary with malicious code, leading to privilege escalation when the service is restarted because the service executes with NT SYSTEM authority.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can leverage the file write permission to replace the `mysqld.exe` file with a malicious executable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where OpenClinic GA is installed.
