  "CVE-2020-27823": {
    "description": "The openjpeg library is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. When the -d option is used, the library performs a wrong calculation of x1,y1, leading to an out-of-bounds write in the `opj_tcd_dc_level_shift_encode` function during encoding of specially crafted input.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect calculation of x1 and y1 values when the `-d` option is used in the encoder.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to denial of service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of crafted JPEG 2000 image files",
      "Use of the `-d` option during encoding"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the vulnerable encoder and use the `-d` option.",
