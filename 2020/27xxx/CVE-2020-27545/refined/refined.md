{
  "vulnerability": "A carefully crafted object with an invalid line table could cause libdwarf to dereference a pointer reading a single byte outside of the intended .debug_line section and potentially outside of memory visible to the library.",
  "affected_component": "libdwarf",
  "root_cause": "The code testing for the error was coded incorrectly so an invalid dereference could occur.",
  "impact": "A segmentation fault is possible, leading to a crash of the application.",
  "attack_vector": "A specially crafted object file with a malformed .debug_line section.",
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malformed object file.",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is a result of incorrect bounds checking when reading a line table. The fix ensures the code now correctly detects the error, and returns a normal error rather than performing an invalid memory access."
