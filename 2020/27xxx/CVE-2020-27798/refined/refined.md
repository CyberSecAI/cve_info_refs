- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by an invalid value being returned by the `get_str_name` function which is then used in `strcmp`. Specifically, `get_str_name` returns `0xff`, an invalid memory address, leading to a segmentation fault when `strcmp` attempts to dereference this address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  The code lacks proper validation on the return value of `get_str_name`. It doesn't check if the returned address is valid before passing it to `strcmp`.
    -  The `abs_symbol_names` array contains null-terminated strings and the loop iterates based on this but `get_str_name` may not return a valid null-terminated string, causing issues.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A crafted input file can trigger a segmentation fault, causing the application to crash. This leads to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file (e.g., a packed executable). The provided POC tar.gz contains such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted input file to the vulnerable UPX program.
