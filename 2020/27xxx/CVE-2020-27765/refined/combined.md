    range of type `unsigned long long` in coders/txt.c

CVE-2020-27759

    In IntensityCompare() of /MagickCore/quantize.c, a
    double value was being casted to int and returned, which in some
    cases caused a value outside the range of type `int` to be
    returned.

CVE-2020-27760

    In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending
    on the `gamma` value, it's possible to trigger a
    divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file
    is processed.

CVE-2020-27761

    WritePALMImage() in /coders/palm.c used size_t casts
    in several areas of a calculation which could lead to
    values outside the range of representable type `unsigned long`
    undefined behavior when a crafted input file was processed.

CVE-2020-27762

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned char` in coders/hdr.c

CVE-2020-27763

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of math division by
    zero in MagickCore/resize.c

CVE-2020-27764

    Out-of-range values was found under some
    circumstances when a crafted input file is processed in
    /MagickCore/statistic.c

CVE-2020-27765

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of math division by
    zero in MagickCore/segment.c when a crafted file is processed

CVE-2020-27766

    A crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of
    type `unsigned long`

CVE-2020-27767

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of types `float` and `unsigned char` in MagickCore/quantum.h

CVE-2020-27768

    An outside the range of representable values of type
    `unsigned int` was found in MagickCore/quantum-private.h

CVE-2020-27769

    An outside the range of representable values of type
    `float` was found in MagickCore/quantize.c

CVE-2020-27770

    Due to a missing check for 0 value of
    `replace_extent`, it is possible for offset `p` to overflow in
    SubstituteString()

CVE-2020-27771

    In RestoreMSCWarning() of /coders/pdf.c there are
    several areas where calls to GetPixelIndex() could result in values
    outside the range of representable for the `unsigned char` type

CVE-2020-27772

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned int` in coders/bmp.c

    64-bit type `ssize_t`.

CVE-2020-27775

    Undefined behavior was found in the form of values outside the
    range of type `unsigned char` in MagickCore/quantum.h

CVE-2020-27776

    A crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of
    type unsigned long.

CVE-2020-29599

    ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which
    allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files.
    The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized
    and it was therefore possible to inject additional
    shell commands via coders/pdf.c.
    On debian system, by default the imagemagick policy
    mitigated this CVE.

CVE-2021-3574

    A memory leak was found converting a crafted TIFF file.

CVE-2021-3596

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in ReadSVGImage() in
    coders/svg.c

CVE-2021-20224

    An integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's
    ExportIndexQuantum() function in MagickCore/quantum-export.c.

CVE-2022-44267

    A Denial of Service was found. When it parses a PNG image,
    the convert process could be left waiting for stdin input.

CVE-2022-44268

    An Information Disclosure was found. When it parses a PNG image,
    (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded
    the content of an arbitrary. file.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

image manipulation programs. An attacker could cause denial of service
and execution of arbitrary code when a crafted image file is
processed.

CVE-2017-14528

    The TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c has incorrect
    expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values
    imply that data validation has occurred, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an
    invalid call to TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted
    file.

CVE-2020-19667

    Stack-based buffer overflow and unconditional jump in ReadXPMImage
    in coders/xpm.c

CVE-2020-25665

    The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to
    AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it
    needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read
    later on in the routine. This could cause impact to reliability.

CVE-2020-25674

    WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for
    loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an
    out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because
    it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values
    but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass
    invalid colormap data to the event logger.

CVE-2020-27560

    ImageMagick allows Division by Zero in OptimizeLayerFrames in
    MagickCore/layer.c, which may cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-27750

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and
    MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that
    is processedcould trigger undefined behavior in the form of values
    outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by
    zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application
    availability, but could potentially cause other problems related
    to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-27760

    In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the
    `gamma` value, it's possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition
    when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could
    lead to an impact to application availability.

CVE-2020-27763

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/resize.c. An attacker who submits a
    crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This
    would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
    but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined
    behavior.

CVE-2020-27765

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/segment.c. An attacker who submits
    a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger
    undefined behavior in the form of math division by zero. This
    would most likely lead to an impact to application availability,
    but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined
    behavior.

CVE-2020-27773

    A flaw was found in MagickCore/gem-private.h. An attacker who
    submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could
    trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range
    of type `unsigned char` or division by zero. This would most
    likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could
    potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior.

CVE-2020-29599

    ImageMagick mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows
    setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The
    user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it
    was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via
    coders/pdf.c.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u11.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.
