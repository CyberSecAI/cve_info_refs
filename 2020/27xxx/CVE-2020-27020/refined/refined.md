  "description": "Kaspersky has fixed a security issue in Kaspersky Password Manager product for several platforms (CVE-2020-27020). Password generator was not completely cryptographically strong and potentially allowed an attacker to predict generated passwords in some cases. An attacker would need to know some additional information (for example, time of password generation).",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The password generator in Kaspersky Password Manager was not cryptographically strong enough.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak password generation algorithm leading to predictable passwords."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially predict generated passwords if they have additional information about the password generation (e.g., time of generation).",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Exploitation requires knowledge of additional information such as password generation time."
    ],
    "attackerRequirements": "An attacker needs to know some additional information (for example, time of password generation)."
