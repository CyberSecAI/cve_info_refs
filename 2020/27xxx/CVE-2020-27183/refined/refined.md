## Analysis of CVE-2020-27183

The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in `konzept-ix publiXone`. This analysis focuses on **CVE-2020-27183**, which relates to **Missing Access Control for API Endpoints**.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of authentication and access control checks on several API endpoints within the Java applet component of the `publiXone` software.

**Vulnerability:** Publicly accessible API endpoints that do not require authentication. These endpoints communicate via serialized Java Objects.

**Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute several functions by abusing unprotected API endpoints. This can lead to:

*   Escalation of privileges within the application.
*   Leakage of all user profiles (`GetUserData`).
*   Arbitrary email sending (`SendMail`).
*   File Upload (`UploadFile`).
*   File Download (`DownloadFile`).
*   Setting user data (`SetUserData`).
*   Create Directories (`CreateDir`).

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can directly access the unprotected API endpoints identified in the Java applet's source code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to decompile the Java applet to identify the available endpoints. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability once the endpoints are known.

**Affected Versions:** 2019.045

**Fixed Version:** 2020.015
