Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-27284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to two instances of **out-of-bounds write** errors within the Delta Electronics TPEditor software when processing project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** The application does not properly validate the boundaries when writing data during the processing of project files, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious project file specifically designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs to have the victim open the malicious project file using the vulnerable TPEditor software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create specially crafted project files.
*   The attacker needs to get the crafted file onto the victim's machine. Social engineering tactics could be used to trick the user into opening the file.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the local network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document states that exploitation requires a user to open a specially crafted project file.
*   The document notes that these vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, which is considered high severity. The CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The affected versions of TPEditor are v1.98 and prior.
*   The suggested mitigation is to update to version 1.98.03 or later.
