- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The communication protocol of the insulin pump and its mobile applications does not adequately protect encryption keys during transit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unprotected Transport of Credentials (CWE-523)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can sniff encryption keys via Bluetooth Low Energy.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via Bluetooth Low Energy communication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in physical proximity to the insulin pump and be able to intercept Bluetooth Low Energy communications.
