### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. Opening a specifically crafted OPC UA message could allow an attacker to crash the server and remotely execute code.

[CVE-2020-27265](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27265) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.2    [HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. Opening a specifically crafted OPC UA message could allow an attacker to crash the server and potentially leak data.

[CVE-2020-27263](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27263) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [USE AFTER FREE CWE-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)

The affected products are vulnerable to a use after free vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to create and close OPC UA connections at a high rate that may cause a server to crash.

[CVE-2020-27267](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-27267) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

Software Toolbox has [released updates](https://www.softwaretoolbox.com/quickfaq.asp?faqid=3924) and recommends users update their installations.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
