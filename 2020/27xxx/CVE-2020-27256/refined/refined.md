This document provides a detailed breakdown of multiple vulnerabilities affecting SOOIL Dana Diabecare RS insulin pumps and associated mobile applications, including CVE-2020-27256.

**CVE-2020-27256 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of a hard-coded physician PIN within the physician menu of the insulin pump.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798)
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can use this hardcoded PIN to change the insulin therapy settings, potentially leading to incorrect insulin delivery.
*   **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the insulin pump is required.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical possession of the device and knowledge of the hardcoded PIN.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Described in the Document:**
The document also describes other vulnerabilities in the same devices, including:

*   **CVE-2020-27258:** Insufficiently protected credentials, allowing extraction of the pump's keypad lock PIN via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27264:** Use of insufficiently random values, allowing brute-forcing of keys via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27266:** Use of client-side authentication, allowing bypass of user authentication checks via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27268:** Client-side enforcement of server-side security, allowing bypass of checks for default PINs via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27269:** Authentication bypass by capture-replay, due to lack of replay protection via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*  **CVE-2020-27270:** Unprotected transport of credentials, allowing sniffing of encryption keys via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27272:** Key exchange without entity authentication, allowing eavesdropping and spoofing via Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **CVE-2020-27276:** Authentication bypass by spoofing, allowing eavesdropping of the authentication sequence via Bluetooth Low Energy.

**General Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   Access sensitive information.
*   Modify therapy settings.
*   Bypass authentication.
*   Crash the device.

These vulnerabilities can directly impact patient safety.

**Mitigation:**
The document provides the following mitigation steps:

*   Update Dana Diabecare insulin pumps and mobile applications (AnyDana-A, AnyDana-i) to version 3.0 or higher.
*   Operate the pump in airplane mode if updates cannot be performed.
*   Maintain tight physical control of the pump and connected devices.
*   Be attentive to pump notifications and alarms.
*   Immediately cancel unintended boluses.
*   Do not connect the pump to unauthorized third-party devices or software.
*   Seek immediate medical help if any unexpected changes occur.
