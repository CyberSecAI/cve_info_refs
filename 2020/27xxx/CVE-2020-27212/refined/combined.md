* Shedding too much Light on a Microcontroller’s Firmware Protection

# Shedding too much Light on a Microcontroller's Firmware Protection

Proceedings of the 11th USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT '17) - Vancouver, BC, Canada            [CVE number 2017-18347](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-18347)

Almost every microcontroller with integrated flash features firmware readout protection. This is a form of content protection which aims at securing intellectual property (IP) as well as cryptographic keys and algorithms from an adversary. One series of microcontrollers are the STM32 which have recently gained popularity and thus are increasingly under attack. However, no practical experience and information on the resilience of STM32 microcontrollers is publicly available. The paper presents the first investigation of the STM32 security concept, especially targeting the STM32F0 sub-series. Starting with a conceptual analysis, we discover three weaknesses and develop them to vulnerabilities by demonstrating corresponding Proofs-of-Concept. At first, we discover that a common security configuration provides low protection which can be exploited using our Cold-boot Stepping approach to extract critical data or even readout-protected firmware. Secondly, we reveal a design weakness in the security configuration storage which allows an attacker to downgrade the level of firmware protection, thereby enabling additional attacks. Thirdly, we discover and analyze a hardware flaw in the debug interface, attributed to a race condition, that allows us to directly extract readprotected firmware using an iterative approach. Each attack requires only low-priced equipment, thereby increasing the impact of each weakness and resulting in a severe threat altogether.

## Laboratory setup for Cold Boot Stepping

[![](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr:content/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset/imageComponent/image.img.jpg/1501770805414/1-coldbootStepping-setup1.jpg)](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr%3Acontent/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset/imageComponent/image.img.4col.large.jpg/1501770805414/1-coldbootStepping-setup1.jpg)

By observing changes in SRAM, one can reverse-engineer the basic control flow, find out the usage of specific addresses and may also discover briefly visible secret data. The system is only allowed to run for a precisely controlled duration and is then stopped. The contents of the SRAM is read out and a snapshot is created. With well chosen and increasing runtime duration this is similar to stepping through the firmware, since only a few instructions are executed between each SRAM snapshot.

## UV-C irradiation setup for Security Downgrade

[![](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr:content/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset_0/imageComponent/image.img.jpg/1501770832653/2-uv1.jpg)](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr%3Acontent/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset_0/imageComponent/image.img.4col.large.jpg/1501770832653/2-uv1.jpg)

The STM32 Readout Protection Level protection mechanism is based on the RDP and nRDP bytes in the option byte memory region. At the power-on event, the option bytes are loaded from flash memory and the corresponding RDP Level is set. We show by experiment, that a flaw in the implementation evolves to a practical threat. The option byte memory region can be modified specifically by UV-C light performing optical fault injection.

## Setup for firmware extraction out of a device using RDP Level 1

[![](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr:content/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset_1/imageComponent/image.img.jpg/1501770858638/3-lvl1Extract.jpg)](/en/FirmwareProtection/jcr%3Acontent/contentPar/sectioncomponent_0/sectionParsys/textwithasset_1/imageComponent/image.img.4col.large.jpg/1501770858638/3-lvl1Extract.jpg)

The STM32F0 series microcontrollers use the Serial Wire Debug interface for debugging and flash programming. When a debugger becomes attached to this interface in Readout Protection Level 1, the flash protection logic cuts access to flash memory. Due to a race condition in the implementation not only a single access can be performed, but the whole firmware can be extracted from a microcontroller.

### Security and Trust in Open Source Security Tokens

Marc Schink, Alexander Wagner, Florian Unterstein, and Johann Heyszl

##### Abstract

Using passwords for authentication has been proven vulnerable in countless security incidents. Hardware authentication tokens effectively prevent most password-related security issues and improve security indisputably. However, we would like to highlight that there are new threats from attackers with physical access which need to be discussed. Supply chain adversaries may manipulate devices on a large scale and install backdoors before they even reach end users. In evil maid scenarios, specific devices may even be attacked while already in use. Hence, we thoroughly investigate the security and trustworthiness of eight commercially available open source authentication tokens, including devices from the two market leaders: SoloKeys and Nitrokey. Unfortunately, we identify and practically verify significant vulnerabilities in all eight examined tokens. Some of them based on severe, previously undiscovered, vulnerabilities of three major microcontroller products which are used at a large scale in various products. Our findings clearly emphasize the significant threat from supply chain and evil maid scenarios since the attacks are practical and only require moderate attacker efforts. Fortunately, we are able to describe software-based countermeasures as effective improvements to retrofit the examined devices. To improve the security and trustworthiness of future authentication tokens, we also derive important general design recommendations.

# Security and Trust in Open Source Security Tokens

Passwords are the most common authentication mechanism for private as well as professional IT services such as social media, banking or enterprise infrastructure. Unfortunately, the use of passwords leads to many security issues. Weak passwords allow for guessing or dictionary attacks, password re-use may lead to credential stuffing where stolen passwords are used for other services of the same users.

This is why hardware security tokens are often used as a second authentication factor to increase the security. These tokens have been designed to prevent the described threats effectively by using strong cryptography and a securely stored key. Although the use of security tokens is generally helpful to improve authentication security, tokens could be manipulated at multiple points before they reach the end user. Starting from the actual token designs going into internationally distributed production, then to the supply chain and distribution to end users, there is significant additional attack surface for malicious manipulation.

In the paper **[Security and Trust in Open Source Security Tokens](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/640.pdf)**, we investigated the trustworthiness of security tokens. We specifically concentrate on security tokens which are marketed as open source and focus on hardware attacks in supply chain and evil maid scenarios. We perform a systematic analysis of the most important commercially available candidates. The trustworthiness of the security tokens was assessed according to a top-down methodology which we outline shortly in the following. We uncovered several vulnerabilities for which we were able to contribute effective software-based mitigation measures to the respective open source projects. All details can be found in the paper. The uncovered vulnerabilities in hardware indicated that respective microchips must only be used with caution when security is important for a product.

#### **Architectural Attacks**

We started with an evaluation of the device architecture and by identifying components which are used for the storage of secrets and authentication operations. Based on the preliminary analysis, we investigated whether the existing inter-chip and debug interfaces have any exploitable logical flaws or are prone to known vulnerabilities. Within this step we successfully compromised the Nitrokey FIDO U2F and the Nitrokey Pro 2 token security measures. The Librem Key from Purism is identical to the Nitrokey Pro 2 and as such it is by this attack affected as well. The attacks are explained in detail in chapter 5 and 6 of this paper.

**Relevant CVEs:**

* Nitrokey FIDO U2F - CVE-2020-12061
* ST Microelectronics STM32F1 - CVE-2020-8004

##

#### **Side-Channel Attacks**

If the previous attempts did not reveal any weaknesses, we focused on the cryptographic implementations that are used during the authentication operations. For that, we used pen-like EM measurement probes with coarse spatial resolution and oscilloscopes operating in a sub-GHz range. This side-channel analysis led to the successful recovery of the private keys for the micro-ecc library, which is used within the Solokeys Solo and the Nitrokey FIDO2 token, and the ARM CryptoCell hardware accelerator, which is contained in the nRF52840 microcontroller and which is part of the Google OpenSK and the Feitian OpenSK token. The details about the side-channel analysis and key recovery is explained in chapter 7.1 and 8.1.

**Relevant CVEs:**

* micro-ecc - CVE-2020-27209
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 - CVE-2020-27211

© Fraunhofer AISECFault Injection Attacks

#### **Fault Injection Attacks**

To further assess the security, we investigated the hardware security features of the included chips in more detail. In this step, we evaluated if included chips exhibit exploitable vulnerabilities with the help of side-channel analyses and fault injections. Due to the black box nature of the implemented security measures reverse engineering effort is needed. We were able to circumvent the read-out protection of the STM32L4 and the nRF52840 microcontroller, which are used in the SoloKeys Solo & Somu, the Nitrokey FIDO2, the Google OpenSK and the Feititan OpenSK. The details of these attacks can be found in chapter 7.2 and 8.2.

**Relevant CVEs:**

* ST Microelectronics STM32L4 - CVE-2020-27212, CVE-2021-29414
* Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 - CVE-2021-29415
* SoloKeys Solo & Somu - CVE-2020-27208
* Nitrokey FIDO2 - CVE-2020-27208

Despite our findings, authentication tokens and second factor authentication are clearly beneficial for security. However, our findings show that it is not always easy to rely on hardware security features which are provided by chip manufacturers. **We conclude that it is highly important to carefully assess the security of microchips against physical attacks in a capable laboratory**. Some vulnerabilities can be mitigated using proper countermeasures, as it was the case here. We proposed effective countermeasures which, at the time of writing, have already been partially implemented. In this way we were able to contribute to the security of current and future authentication tokens. In other cases, however, hardware vulnerabilities may be unrecoverable. This shows the high relevance of hardware security for the security of end products. The full details of the analysis, attacks as well as countermeasures can be found in the paper, which is open access and linked below.
