Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-27212:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a flaw in the implementation of the read-out protection mechanism of the ST Microelectronics STM32L4 microcontroller. This flaw allows attackers to circumvent the intended protection. Specifically, fault injection attacks were used to bypass the read-out protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Circumvented Read-Out Protection:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the read-out protection mechanism of the STM32L4 microcontroller. This mechanism is meant to prevent the extraction of firmware from the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firmware Extraction:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract the firmware from the microcontroller, potentially exposing sensitive information like cryptographic keys, algorithms, and intellectual property.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Fault Injection:** The attack vector is fault injection. Fault injection techniques, in combination with side-channel analysis, are used to manipulate the behavior of the microcontroller and bypass the read-out protection mechanism.
*   **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the device containing the vulnerable microcontroller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:**  The attacker needs physical access to the device containing the STM32L4 microcontroller.
*   **Fault Injection Expertise:** The attacker needs expertise in fault injection techniques and side-channel analysis. They need to be able to setup and execute these types of attacks.
*   **Specialized Equipment:** The attacker requires access to specialized equipment for fault injection and side-channel analysis such as UV-C light sources, EM probes, and oscilloscopes.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions the STM32L4 is used in several devices, including the SoloKeys Solo & Somu, the Nitrokey FIDO2. This means that the vulnerability affects multiple products using this microcontroller.
*   The content also describes attacks against the nRF52840 microcontroller, which is related to CVE-2021-29415, and micro-ecc (CVE-2020-27209).
* Countermeasures are mentioned as a way to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
