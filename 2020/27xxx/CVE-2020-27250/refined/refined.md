Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` method within the SoftMaker Office PlanMaker application when parsing a crafted Microsoft Excel file. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when handling record type 0xf150 within an OfficeArtDggContainer record, where the application trusts the length field from the record header, leading to a buffer overflow when copying data into a fixed-size buffer in memory.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The application copies data from a record into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow in the heap.
- Trust of untrusted data: The application relies on the length field from the record header, which is controlled by the attacker, when copying data.
- Lack of sufficient size checks: The application does not validate if the length of data to be copied exceeds the size of the destination buffer.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Heap corruption: Overwriting heap metadata or other heap objects
- Code execution: The attacker can gain control of the application's execution flow by corrupting heap memory to overwrite function pointers, which can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- Application crash: Due to memory corruption, the application may crash, leading to denial of service.

Attack vectors:
- File parsing: An attacker crafts a malicious Excel document containing specific Office Art records within an MsoDrawingGroup container
- User interaction: The attacker entices a user to open the malicious Excel document using SoftMaker Office PlanMaker.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to craft a malicious Excel file with specific formatting and record structure.
- Requires user interaction to open the malicious file, meaning the attacker must be able to deliver the file to the victim and convince them to open the file.
