{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `DecGTK()` function during the processing of the WPA2 4-way handshake, specifically in the AES decryption phase.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on user-controlled size parameters when using `AES_UnWRAP()` and `_wrap_memcpy()`.",
       "Lack of proper input validation for the size of the encrypted GTK in the EAPOL-Key message.",
       "Missing buffer overflow mitigations such as canaries or ASLR."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to remote code execution on the Wi-Fi module, which could potentially grant root access on the OS (such as Linux or Android) of the embedded device using this module, allowing complete control over the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device or know the network's PSK to initiate the 4-way handshake.",
      "The attack is performed by sending a crafted EAPOL-Key message with an overly large encrypted GTK value during the WPA2 4-way handshake process.",
      "The attacker can impersonate the access point by sending deauth packets and making the victim connect to a malicious AP."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to passively monitor Wi-Fi traffic to identify a vulnerable network, and then actively participate in the WPA2 handshake process as a rogue access point. Knowledge of the network PSK is required to perform the attack."
