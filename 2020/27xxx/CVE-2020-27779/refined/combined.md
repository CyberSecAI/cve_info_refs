**GRUB** is a multiboot secondary [bootloader](/wiki/Bootloader "Bootloader") capable of loading kernels from a variety of [filesystems](/wiki/Filesystem "Filesystem") on most system architectures. GRUB supports PC BIOS, PC EFI, IEEE 1275 (Open Firmware), SPARC, and MIPS Lemote Yeeloong.

GRUB, or more formally **GRUB 2**, replaces the original "GRUB Legacy" (or "GRUB 1") with an entirely separate code base featuring a new shell-like syntax for advanced scripting capabilities.

Since GRUB 2 superseded GRUB legacy long ago, today it is commonly called simply "GRUB".

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The GRUB\_PLATFORMS variable in make.conf controls what **target** GRUB will use with grub-install. The **amd64** architecture includes a profile default which works for most systems.

FILE **`/etc/portage/make.conf`****Example of setting the GRUB\_PLATFORMS variable for EMU, EFI, and PC platforms**
```
GRUB_PLATFORMS="emu efi-32 efi-64 pc"

```

The following platforms are supported depending on the target CPU:

| Platform | Target | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| i386 | ia64 | mips | mipsel | powerpc | sparc64 | x86\_64 |
| ARC | No | No | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Coreboot | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | 32-bit |
| EFI | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| EMU | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| IEEE 1275 (Open Firmware) | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | 32-bit |
| Loongson | No | No | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Multiboot | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | 32-bit |
| QEMU | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | 32-bit |
| QEMU-MIPS | No | No | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| PC | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | 32-bit |

 **Note**
Whenever the values in the GRUB\_PLATFORMS variable are adjusted GRUB will need to be re-emerged in order to build the changed binary. Be sure to use the `--newuse --deep` options as shown in the [emerge section](/wiki/GRUB#Emerge "GRUB") below.

The **amd64** profiles enable support for (U)EFI functionality by default. When using a BIOS-based system, set GRUB\_PLATFORMS variable to `pc` to avoid unneeded dependencies.

### Emerge

 **Important**
Installing GRUB with [emerge](/wiki/Emerge "Emerge") does not *enable* the boot loader's operation. This only installs the "GRUB system and utilities" to the appropriate subdirectories of the Gentoo root filesystem. To install GRUB from there so that it will be used when booting the system, additional steps need to be taken. These steps are covered in the [Configuration](/wiki/GRUB#Configuration "GRUB") section.

To install GRUB use the following emerge syntax:

`root #``emerge --ask --newuse --deep sys-boot/grub`
 **Tip**
On Gentoo, *os-prober* is neither installed nor enabled when installing GRUB, because of security concerns. If this is needed, see the [additional software](#additional_software_os-prober) section for more information.
### Additional software

#### os-prober to automatically detect available operating systems

Optionally, the os-prober utility (provided through the [sys-boot/os-prober](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-boot/os-prober) package) can be installed to let GRUB probe and generate boot entries for other operating systems when running the grub-mkconfig command. In most instances, this will enable GRUB to automatically detect other operating systems including Windows 7, 8.1, 10, other distributions of Linux, etc.

`root #``emerge --ask --newuse sys-boot/os-prober`
 **Tip**
Due to security concerns, os-prober is disabled by default. Set GRUB\_DISABLE\_OS\_PROBER=false in /etc/default/grub to enable it. See [corresponding troubleshooting section](#os-prober_not_running).
#### libisoburn for rescue image creation with grub-mkrescue

[dev-libs/libisoburn](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/libisoburn) may be installed to allow creation of rescue images with the grub-mkrescue utility:

`root #``emerge --ask dev-libs/libisoburn`
#### Boot from ISOs from your main storage - without USB

<https://wiki.grml.org/doku.php?id=rescueboot>

From Guru:

`root #``emerge --ask sys-boot/grml-rescueboot`

Or manually launch discs with GRUB's loopback device:

FILE **`/etc/grub.d/40_custom`**
```
menuentry "systemrescue-11.02-amd64.iso" {
     iso_path="/systemrescue-11.02-amd64.iso"
     export iso_path
     search --set=root --file $iso_path

     # support booting recent GRUB versions on UEFI systems
     rmmod tpm

     loopback loop $iso_path
     set root=(loop)
     # the path below is on the SystemRescue ISO, not the hard drive
     configfile /boot/grub/loopback.cfg
}

```

After saving the entry, to update GRUB:

`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
#### sys-fs/mdadm for RAID device detection

[sys-fs/mdadm](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-fs/mdadm) may be installed to enable RAID device detection:

`root #``emerge --ask sys-fs/mdadm`
## GRUB Bootloader Installation

Installing GRUB as the system's boot loader depends on how the system is meant to boot (through which type of firmware, e.g. on PCs either the legacy [BIOS](/wiki/BIOS "BIOS") or its successor [UEFI](/wiki/UEFI "UEFI")) and how the disk on which the boot loader should be installed is partitioned (e.g. on a PC, whether it is using the [MBR](/wiki/Master_Boot_Record "Master Boot Record") or the [GPT](/wiki/GPT "GPT") [partition](/wiki/Partition "Partition") layout).

This article covers the following situations:

* [BIOS with MBR](/wiki/GRUB#BIOS_with_MBR "GRUB") or (U)EFI using the CSM (often called 'BIOS mode' or 'legacy/compatibility mode')
* [BIOS with GPT](/wiki/GRUB#BIOS_with_GPT "GRUB")
* [UEFI with GPT](/wiki/GRUB#UEFI_with_GPT "GRUB"), the native (U)EFI boot mode
* [Open Firmware (IEEE 1275) on PowerPC](/wiki/GRUB#Open_Firmware_.28IEEE_1275.29_on_PowerPC "GRUB")

Select the installation instructions appropriate for the system.

### UEFI with GPT

 **Warning**
Even though 64-bit processors of Intel/AMD architecture ("x86\_64", for which Gentoo uses the **amd64** notation) support running 32-bit software, it is not possible for an EFI implementation to do the same. A 64-bit EFI will not be able to run 32-bit .efi loaders! It should be noted that some early 64-bit-capable systems, used a 32-bit implementation of EFI, like some early MacBooks (Intel Core 2) and some pre-2010 Windows computers. In such cases, even though the processor is 64-bit, (U)EFI is implemented as 32-bit software, so `efi-32` would be the correct GRUB platform.
 **Note**
If the CSM is used, refer to [BIOS with MBR](/wiki/GRUB#BIOS_with_MBR "GRUB") or [BIOS with GPT](/wiki/GRUB#BIOS_with_GPT "GRUB") instead. CSM stands for "Compatibility Support Module" and is a BIOS emulation, making the UEFI behave like a BIOS. In the firmware setup user interface it is often called "Legacy Mode" or "Compatibility Mode". CSM has always been optional and was phased out on mainstream systems (such as PCs) in 2020.
#### Partitioning for UEFI with GPT

UEFI systems boot from executable files (.efi files) in a variant of Microsoft's Portable Executable format —PE32+, specifically—, on their [EFI System Partition](/wiki/EFI_System_Partition "EFI System Partition") (ESP). The EFI System Partition can be just about any size, [with implementation considerations in mind](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/esp-size-guide.html).

 **Important**
For UEFI GPT boot, the system *must* have a dedicated ESP containing a [FAT](/wiki/FAT "FAT") filesystem.

Only the bootloader's .efi file is *required* to be in EFI System Partition. Typically, /boot contains the kernels, [initramfs](/wiki/Initramfs "Initramfs") if needed, and GRUB's configuration file and support files.

 **Note**
The EFI System Partition is usually mounted at /boot, /boot/efi or /efi. Using /efi allows files like the kernel, initramfs and bootloader support files to be stored on a separate partition and filesystem, or on the root filesystem itself; the later requires that GRUB can access the root filesystem and read the required files, which may not always be possible or very hard to set up (like with root filesystem encryption).

A size of 128MB for the EFI System Partition is reasonable, this allows multiple PE32+ .efi files to be stored. There is little harm in keeping backups of working PE32+ files, which could still be booted if a new one is installed.

Create the partition using the partitioning [tool of choice](/wiki/Partition#GUID_Partition_Table_.28GPT.29 "Partition").

##### Partitioning with fdisk

 **Note**
In the example contained in [Preparing the disks](/wiki/Handbook%3AAMD64/Installation/Disks "Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks"), an EFI System Partition with a FAT32 filesystem mounted at /efi is shown. Depending on the preferred system configuration, a separate partition for /boot may be desirable, e.g. in the case of filesystem encryption.

If using fdisk to do the partitioning, start by opening the disk for modification, /dev/sda in this example:

`root #``fdisk /dev/sda`
```
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.38.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

```

A new partition table can be created using **g**:

`Command (m for help):``g`
```

Created a new GPT disklabel (GUID: 4AB36B49-BAAD-D544-AC45-E3154565018D).
```

A new partition can be created using **n**:

`Command (m for help):``n`
```

Partition number (1-128, default 1): 1
First sector (2048-121012190, default 2048):
Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-121012190, default 121010175): +128M

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 128 MiB.

```

Once the partition is created, its Partition Type GUID must be set to that of the EFI System Partition; this can be accomplished with the **t** option, to change the *partition type*, and then selecting **1** to set it to "EFI System Partition":

`Command (m for help):``t`
```

Selected partition 1
Partition type or alias (type L to list all): 1
Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'EFI System'.

```

Finally, the changes can be saved by running **w**:

`Command (m for help):``w`
```

The partition table has been altered.
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.

```

Now, the partition can be formatted to use the FAT32 filesystem with:

`root #``mkfs.fat -F 32 -n efi-boot /dev/sda1``root #``mount /dev/sda1 /efi``root #``mkdir -p /efi/EFI`

To determine the *partition UUID* (PARTUUID) of the new partition, the following command can be used:

`user $``lsblk -o name,partuuid`
```
NAME   PARTUUID
sda
└─sda1 20f3d6cc-9781-3640-9232-0f5a8c662a60

```

To create a [fstab](/wiki//etc/fstab "/etc/fstab") entry for this partition:

FILE **`/etc/fstab`****Adding the ESP's mountpoint**
```
PARTUUID=20f3d6cc-9781-3640-9232-0f5a8c662a60       /efi      vfat    noauto,noatime  1 2

```
#### Installing GRUB for EFI

 **Note**
Gentoo's **amd64** profiles set a reasonable default for the GRUB\_PLATFORMS variable, and grub-install can usually figure out whether to install GRUB for EFI, for BIOS with MBR or for BIOS with GPT, so setting GRUB\_PLATFORMS in /etc/portage/make.conf is usually not necessary. Users might want to set it so that it matches their computer's platform, to make emerge sys-boot/grub install fewer files. As mentioned before, 32-bit UEFI systems need `efi-32` set in GRUB\_PLATFORMS.

Before installing GRUB, the EFI System Partition must be mounted. If there is an entry for it in the [fstab](/wiki//etc/fstab "/etc/fstab"), it can be mounted just by specifying the corresponding mountpoint. Assuming it is /efi, like in the example from the Handbook:

`root #``mount /efi`

grub-install copies GRUB's support files to /boot/grub, GRUB's PE32+ executable to the \EFI\gentoo directory of the ESP with name grubx64.efi (making its full pathname /efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi if the ESP is mounted at /efi), and calls [efibootmgr](/wiki/Efibootmgr "Efibootmgr") to add a boot entry.

 **Important**
In order for grub-install's call to efibootmgr to succeed, the efivarfs pseudo-filesystem must be mounted read-write, before using the grub-install command. If support for this pseudo-filesystem was built as a module, the efivarfs kernel module must be loaded.

If the ESP is mounted at /boot/efi:

`root #``grub-install`
```
Installation finished. No error reported.

```

If the ESP is mounted elsewhere, an `--efi-directory` option specifying its mountpoint's pathname must be used. So, if the ESP is mounted at /efi, like in the example from the Handbook:

`root #``grub-install --efi-directory=/efi`
```
Installation finished. No error reported.

```

 **Note**
By default, GRUB installs targeting the platform of system which the command is executed on. If another system platform is used (e. g. if the computer was booted in CSM mode, making the platform BIOS with GPT), the `--target=x86_64-efi` option (or `--target=i386-efi` for a 32-bit UEFI target) can be used to target an EFI platform.
 **Note**
The `--removable` option can be used to install GRUB's PE32+ executable to the \EFI\BOOT directory of the ESP with name BOOTX64.efi (making its full pathname /efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi if the ESP is mounted at /efi). This is only recommended when installing to a removable medium, or when installing on a computer with limited UEFI firmware that does not support boot entries with arbitrary pathnames very well. See also [EFI System Partition #Removable media](/wiki/EFI_System_Partition#Removable_media "EFI System Partition").
### BIOS with MBR

 **Note**
When the system is meant to dual-boot with another (pre-installed) operating system, such as Microsoft Windows, make sure that the Linux bootloader can coexist or dual-boot both operating systems. On PCs it is recommended to use the same boot method as the pre-installed system, e.g. when Windows is using the legacy MBR partitioning, it is also booted in 'legacy BIOS' mode (UEFI calls it CSM, short for Compatibility Support Module, in essence a BIOS emulation). If the mode is changed, e.g. from EFI-CSM (BIOS mode) to native (U)EFI mode, the pre-installed system will most certainly no longer be bootable.

Make sure that the /boot location is available - if this uses a separate partition, make sure that it is mounted:

`root #``mount /boot`

Run the grub-install command to copy the relevant files to /boot/grub. On the PC platform, this also installs a boot image to the Master Boot Record (MBR) or a partition's boot sector. If all goes well, after running grub-install an output such as the one below is to be expected:

`root #``grub-install /dev/sda`
```
Installation finished. No error reported.

```

grub-install accepts a `--target` option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, grub-install will attempt to guess the proper values; on an **amd64**/**x86** system it will use `i386-pc` by default. grub-install also accepts a `--boot-directory` option to tell the GRUB installer which directory to look for the boot files. This defaults to the current /boot but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

#### Partitioning for BIOS with MBR

Be sure to leave enough free space before the first partition. Starting the first partition at sector 2048 leaves at least 1 MiB of disk space for the master boot record. It is recommended (but not mandatory) to create an additional partition for GRUB called the *BIOS boot partition*. This partition just needs to be defined, but not formatted. It is only needed if the system is later migrated to the GPT partition layout. When sticking with MBR, this is not needed.

If the [Gentoo installation instructions](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page") were followed, this BIOS boot partition will already be available.

### BIOS with GPT

 **Warning**
Although GPT was not designed for legacy BIOS systems, it defines a [protective MBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Protective_MBR_(LBA_0)) to maintain compatibility and prevent MBR-based utilities from misinterpreting GPT disks. In dual-boot setups with legacy OSes that rely on MBR (common in BIOS-based systems), partitions must be accessed via the MBR. This is achievable using hybrid GPT/MBR partitions, which combine a standard GPT layout with a modified MBR to bridge compatibility. However, this approach comes with some limitations.

On a BIOS system with GPT partitioning, GRUB relies on a partition called "BIOS boot partition". This partition is not formatted with a file system, instead grub-install will copy parts of the boot loader to it. The "BIOS boot partition" is not the same partition as a /boot partition.

 **Note**
See also [What is the BIOS boot partition?](/wiki/Handbook%3AX86/Blocks/Disks#What_is_the_BIOS_boot_partition.3F "Handbook:X86/Blocks/Disks") in the **x86** Handbook.

If a /boot partition is needed, start by mounting the /boot partition:

`root #``mount /boot`

If all goes well, after running the grub-install command an output such as the one below is to be expected:

`root #``grub-install /dev/sda`
```
Installation finished. No error reported.

```

grub-install accepts a `--target` option to set the CPU architecture and system platform. If unspecified, grub-install will attempt to guess the correct values; on an **amd64**/**x86** system in BIOS mode it will use `i386-pc` by default and in conjunction with a GUID partition table (GPT) a "BIOS boot partition" will be automatically used when present.

grub-install also accepts a `--boot-directory` option to tell the GRUB installer which directory to look in for the boot files. This defaults to the current /boot but is useful when trying to move a root partition.

#### Dual-boot with Windows

When the system is meant to dual-boot with Microsoft Windows installed in BIOS mode, full and native GPT partitioning isn't possible. Windows only allows to be booted from an MBR partition when in BIOS mode, which includes the BIOS emulation mode of (U)EFI called 'CSM'. For Linux however it is still possible to use a GPT partitioning scheme even from BIOS (or EFI-CSM) mode, but for the dual-boot with Windows this requires hybrid partitioning: up to four partitions can be defined in both the GPT and the MBR partition tables simultainiously.

 **Note**
Traditionally x86-PCs used a BIOS as firmware. After the switch to (U)EFI on PCs (around 2005) there used to be a BIOS emulation called 'Compatibility Support Module' (CSM), PCs were therefore still compatible with existing operating systems. On mainstream PCs the EFI-CSM has been phased out since 2020. Even before 2020 some (U)EFI implementations, such as servers, lacked the CSM completely. 'Legacy BIOS mode' is therefore no longer available on modern UEFI systems. UEFI in its native boot mode demands the GUID Partition Table (GPT), a pre-installed operating system will therefore already be using a GPT partitioning scheme.

An already installed Windows will refuse to boot when the boot mode or the partitioning scheme is changed. Also, older Windows systems don't support GPT (or EFI) at all, demanding that a BIOS or the EFI-CSM along with an MBR must be used. If Windows supports EFI it can be re-installed in the native UEFI mode and the GPT partitioning scheme, as well as Linux; see section [UEFI with GPT](/wiki/GRUB#UEFI_with_GPT "GRUB").

[Hybrid partitioning](/wiki/Hybrid_partition_table "Hybrid partition table") between GPT and MBR creates both a valid GPT partition table and a valid MBR partition table at the same time, but limits the total number of hybrid partitions to four because of the four primary partition limit of the MBR. Since the ESP (the [EFI System Partition](/wiki/EFI_System_Partition "EFI System Partition") holding the EFI bootloaders) takes up one partition this leaves only three shared partitions between MBR and GPT. When one partition is used for Windows and one for Linux, there is only one additional hybrid partition possible, like a separate Linux /boot partition or a shared data partition between the two operating systems.

 **Warning**
Normally, a GPT partition table will always also create an MBR partition table which holds only one partition spanning over the whole disk. This will ensure that older software doesn't mistake the disk as 'empty'. The MBR with its protective partition is therefore called a 'protecive MBR' and is part of the GPT specification. By defining hybrid partitions, this protective feature of the GPT is sacrificed! Legacy software will no longer see used space when analyzing the hybrid MBR. Software that is unaware of the GPT and only sees the MBR may mistake undefined disk space as unused and empty space. Data written outside the defined MBR partitions may cause data loss to the underlying GPT partitions!

If there are two physical disks available to the system, a great solution is to have one disk use the GPT and the other the MBR partitioning scheme. Normally, the Windows installation uses only one partition as 'system partition' and 'boot partition', called 'drive C:'. When in BIOS mode the initial partition for booting, the 'system partition', must be an MBR partition. This applies to every Windows version since Windows XP and includes Windows 10. Since Windows Vista (actually Windows XP x64 Edition) the Microsoft operating system supports accessing GPT partitions. The solution is to relocate the 'system partition' part of an installation to the MBR partitioned disk, and convert the 'boot partition' (the one containing \WINDOWS) into a GPT partitioned disk. Windows can thereafter access all the GPT partitions on the one disk, and will continue to use the MBR partitions (or hybrid partitions) on the disk containing the 'system partition'. The Windows installation (containing \WINDOWS) would be a GPT partition, even when booted in BIOS mode. Windows 11 no longer supports BIOS/CSM/MBR mode.

#### Partitioning for BIOS with GPT

When a GPT partition table is present on the system, a small *BIOS boot partition* with type `EF02` (which is different from the *EFI System Partition (ESP)* which has type `EF00`) will need to be available. 1 MiB will be enough to work, but 2-4 MiB is a safer option. This BIOS boot partition will hold the stage 2 of the bootloader. BIOS boot partitions do not need to be formatted with a filesystem; the grub-install command will overwrite any existing filesystem with one of its own.

 **Important**
The BIOS boot partition is *not* the same partition that is commonly mounted at /boot. The /boot and BIOS boot are different partitions and should be handled separately. The BIOS boot partition should *not* be regularly mounted on the system (i.e., it should *not* be defined in /etc/fstab). The /boot partition *can* be regularly mounted with no issues and therefore can be present in the /etc/fstab file.

To set a partition as a BIOS partition use the command-line tool parted ([sys-block/parted](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-block/parted)) by typing (change `1` to the number of the partition to mark as a BIOS boot partition!):

`(parted)``set 1 bios_grub on`

With [sys-apps/gptfdisk](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-apps/gptfdisk)'s cgdisk utility, this is accomplished by setting the partition type to `0xEF02` and giving it a label of `gptbios`.

An EFI System Partition is not required, but it would be sensible to make sure that the BIOS boot partition is large enough to be converted to one, should the system motherboard later be upgraded to an UEFI board.

The following is the output of pressing the `p` key using the gdisk utility on a GPT-partitioned disk with both a BIOS boot [0xEF02] partition and an EFI [0xEF00] partition:

`root #``gdisk /dev/sdc`

Creating partitions in gdisk is straightforward for users familiar with the fdisk partitioning utility. After starting gdisk, type `n` (for new) in the main menu, provide beginning and end sectors (if needed), and set the partition type to `EF00` for an EFI system partition.

Users who have followed the [Gentoo installation instructions](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page") will already have the proper partitioning layout set up.

### Open Firmware (IEEE 1275) on PowerPC

See [GRUB on Open Firmware (PowerPC)](/wiki/GRUB_on_Open_Firmware_%28PowerPC%29 "GRUB on Open Firmware (PowerPC)").

### Install on encrypted partition

If the whole disk is encrypted, including /boot, extra steps need to be taken, to allow GRUB to decrypt and mount the device.

The [device-mapper](https://www.gentoo.org/support/use-flags/) [USE flag](/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag") needs to be set when emerging the GRUB package. Then the [sys-fs/cryptsetup](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-fs/cryptsetup) package needs to be installed. The partition needs to be encrypted as [luks1](/wiki/Dm-crypt#Full_disk_encryption_booting "Dm-crypt") partition type.

After installing GRUB on the device, depending on the way the kernel is setup, [initramfs](/wiki/Dm-crypt_full_disk_encryption#Generating_an_initramfs "Dm-crypt full disk encryption") might need to be modified in order for the system to boot completely. If a [distribution kernel](/wiki/Kernel#Distribution_kernels "Kernel") is installed, [Dracut](/wiki/Dracut "Dracut") will be installed on the system as well and can be used to finish the configuration.

## Configuration

Once GRUB has been installed, it can be configured to suit the specific system. In most cases, no additional configuration is required.

### Main configuration file

The grub-mkconfig script is used to generate a grub configuration. It uses the scripts under /etc/grub.d/\* together with the /etc/default/grub configuration file to generate the final /boot/grub/grub.cfg - the only configuration file used by GRUB itself.

| File | Format | Edits recommended? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig | POSIX shell script | No | Installed as part of the [sys-boot/grub](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-boot/grub):2 package. Run this script to generate /boot/grub/grub.cfg after configuring the files described below. |
| /boot/grub/grub.cfg | GRUB shell script | No | The file generated by grub-mkconfig. This file is evaluated by GRUB's built-in script interpreter and doesn't necessarily support all POSIX commands or syntax. See the [scripting reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Shell_002dlike-scripting) in the GRUB manual for supported features. Be aware that modifications to this file won't persist to the next time grub-mkconfig is run. |
| /etc/grub.d/\* | POSIX shell scripts | Maybe | Each script under /etc/grub.d/\* that has its execute bit set is evaluated in sequence, and the stdout is concatenated to form the final /boot/grub/grub.cfg (or whatever file is given to the grub-mkconfig `-o` option). These scripts use the current system shell and therefore can use any supported syntax. Ideally they should be POSIX-compatible scripts, and the output script must be compatible with the GRUB interpreter. It may be necessary to disable or add scripts. For instance, to add menu items that couldn't be automatically generated. |
| /boot/grub/custom.cfg | GRUB shell script | Maybe | The /etc/grub.d/41\_custom script will reference this file to be read in at boot time if it exists. This file provides a place to add additional entries or commands and does not require regeneration of the main grub.cfg file. |
| /etc/default/grub | POSIX shell script | Yes | In most cases this is the only file that should be modified directly. It is mainly used to assign variables used by the scripts in /etc/grub.d to generate a working configuration file. See [GRUB configuration variables](/wiki/GRUB/Configuration_variables "GRUB/Configuration variables") or the [official reference](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Simple-configuration) for supported variables. |

GRUB does not require the administrator to manually maintain a boot option configuration (as is the case with boot loaders such as GRUB Legacy and [LILO](/wiki/LILO "LILO")). Instead it can generate its configuration file (/boot/grub/grub.cfg) using the grub-mkconfig command. This utility will use the scripts in /etc/grub.d/ and the settings in /etc/default/grub.

 **Warning**
The grub-mkconfig utility does not work properly when using software RAID. Manual configuration of the scripts in /etc/grub.d/ is necessary, as otherwise after installation the system will be left in a non-bootable state.

After modifying one or more settings, run the grub-mkconfig utility with the `-o` option pointing to the output file located at /boot/grub/grub.cfg (this is GRUB's default output location):

`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
```
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.3.0-gentoo
done

```

Each time the grub-mkconfig utility is called a new configuration will be generated.

 **Warning**
If grub-mkconfig does not report any found entries then no entries were found. In this case GRUB will offer no boot selections when upon system restart which may be a tricky, time consuming situation to resolve. Make sure the output is satisfactory before restarting the system.
### Setting configuration parameters

The following variables in /etc/default/grub are the most common ones to set to control how GRUB will function:

| Variable | Explanation | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GRUB\_DEFAULT | Defines the default menu entry selected on boot. May be a numeric index, a menu title, or "saved". | Defaults to first detected entry. |
| GRUB\_TIMEOUT | Delay (in seconds) before booting default menu entry. Set to `0` to boot immediately or `-1` to wait indefinitely. | The default is 5 seconds. |
| GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX | Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for all Linux menu entries. For instance, to support hibernation, users will need to add `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="resume=/dev/sdXY"` with /dev/sdXY being the swap partition. |  |
| GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX\_DEFAULT | Parameters to be passed on the kernel command line for non-recovery Linux menu entries. |  |
| GRUB\_DEVICE | The initial root device (i.e. the kernel's `root=` parameter). Set this to override the grub-mkconfig command's root device auto-detection. For example, `GRUB_DEVICE=/dev/ram0` will force `root=/dev/ram0` to be used in the kernel command line. |  |

For a more complete list, please refer to the [configuration variables](/wiki/GRUB/Configuration_variables "GRUB/Configuration variables") sub-page and as the info page of grub-mkconfig.

After modifying the parameters, regenerate the GRUB configuration file with grub-mkconfig.

### Enabling or disabling configuration scripts

The directory /etc/grub.d/ contains the scripts that grub-mkconfig uses to generate a grub.cfg file. By default the contents of this directory should be similar to the following:

`user $``ls /etc/grub.d/`
```
00_header  10_linux  20_linux_xen  30_os-prober  40_custom  41_custom README

```

GRUB will use all installed scripts that are marked as executable (which by default, they all are). To disable any of the scripts simply remove the executable bit from the script's file permissions using the chmod command. In the following example every script but 00\_header and 10\_linux are disabled:

`root #``chmod -x /etc/grub.d/{20_linux_xen,30_os-prober,40_custom,41_custom}`

After modifying the scripts (or removing the executable bit), regenerate the configuration file using grub-mkconfig.

### Manipulating configuration scripts

Some features or functionalities are only possible to be exploited by modifying the configuration scripts. For instance, to support dual-booting with FreeBSD, the following manipulation needs to be done.

Change the /etc/grub.d/40\_custom script to:

FILE **`/etc/grub.d/40_custom`****Adding an entry for dual booting**
```
menuentry "FreeBSD" --class freebsd --class bsd --class os {
 insmod ufs2
 insmod bsd
 set root=(hd0,1)
 kfreebsd /boot/kernel/kernel
 kfreebsd_loadenv /boot/device.hints
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom=ufs:/dev/ada0s1a
 set kFreeBSD.vfs.root.mountfrom.options=rw
 set kFreeBSD.hw.psm.synaptics_support=1
}

```

/dev/sda1 or `(hd0,1)` is the partition in which FreeBSD resides. If the normal UFS install was used for the FreeBSD partition then /dev/sda1 is a container (something like a logical partition). It consists of the swap and root partition. Verify the 40\_custom script is executable by running ls -la /etc/grub.d/40\_custom. If the executable bit is not set then set it using the chmod u+x 40\_custom command.

 **Note**
Users familiar with how GRUB Legacy numbered partitions should note partitions starting from 1, not 0, with GRUB.

Next install GRUB and update the configuration file:

`root #``grub-install /dev/sda``root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
## Extended features

GRUB 2 has many features that make it a very powerful boot loader. It supports:

* Booting from UEFI platforms.
* Booting from GPT partitioned drives without needing a hybrid MBR (hybrid MBR can enabled as needed for compatibility or portability).
* Booting from a [btrfs](/wiki/Btrfs "Btrfs") formatted /boot partition.
* Booting from a [ZFS](/wiki/ZFS "ZFS") pool.
* Booting directly from a [btrfs](/wiki/Btrfs "Btrfs") RAID set without needing an [initramfs](/wiki/Initramfs "Initramfs") for early mount setup.
* Booting directly from logical volume management (such as [LVM2](/wiki/LVM "LVM")).
* Booting with support for DM-RAID (RAID 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10).
* Booting from encrypted devices (LUKS).

Some specific features are explained in more detail next.

### Chainloading

GRUB 2 was built with a truly improved chainload mode when compared to GRUB Legacy. To chainload another boot loader, use the `chainloader` option.

FILE **`/etc/grub.d/40_custom`****Chainloading another bootloader**
```
menuentry "Custom Super-bootloader example" {
     insmod part_msdos
     insmod chain
     chainloader (hd1,1)+1
}

```

For more information on chainloading, please see the [Chainloading](/wiki/GRUB/Chainloading "GRUB/Chainloading") sub-page.

### Password protection of GRUB menu

To secure GRUB so it is not possible for anyone to change boot parameters or use the command line, add a user/password combination to GRUB's configuration files. The program grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 generates password hashes for GRUBː

`user $``grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2`
```
Password:
Reenter password:

PBKDF2 hash of your password is grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.9CA4611006FE96BC77A...
```

Then, add the following toː

FILE **`/etc/grub.d/35_auth:`**
```
# Grub user
echo 'set superusers="<username>"'
# Grub password
echo 'password_pbkdf2 <username> <password-hash>'

```

The above may lock all Grub menu entries, even the default entry. In that case, to allow users to boot some menu entries without a password, see [Securing the grub boot loader](https://daniel-lange.com/archives/75-Securing-the-grub-boot-loader.html).

The permissions for the file need to be properly set before doing grub-mkconfig:

`root #``chmod 755 /etc/grub.d/35_auth`
### Using framebuffer display

To have GRUB use a [framebuffer](/wiki/Framebuffer "Framebuffer") graphical display, re-emerge GRUB with the `truetype` USE flag enabled. This will install a default True Type font as well as a font conversion utility.

`root #``emerge --ask --newuse sys-boot/grub:2`

Proceed to configure the default configuration file located at /etc/default/grub. For example:

FILE **`/etc/default/grub`****Framebuffer related settings**
```
# Set resolution and color depth
GRUB_GFXMODE=1366x768x32

# Keep resolution when loading the kernel
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep

# Set a background image
GRUB_BACKGROUND="/boot/grub/bg.png"

# Use a custom font, converted using grub-mkfont utility
GRUB_FONT="/boot/grub/fonts/roboto.pf2"

# Set the menu colors
GRUB_COLOR_NORMAL="light-blue/black"
GRUB_COLOR_HIGHLIGHT="light-cyan/blue"

```
#### HiDPI displays

On modern displays with high DPI ("HiDPI"), e.g. UHD (3840x2160), the standard font will look very small. If you like to have the same font as the kernel, Terminus can be used, which resembles a BIOS built-in textmode font.

To select this font in-kernel, `CONFIG_FONT_TER16x32` has to be enabled.

KERNEL **Kernel compiled-in fonts**
```
Library routines  --->
      [*] Select compiled-in fonts
      [*] Terminus 16x32 font (not supported by all drivers)

```

The same font is available as [media-fonts/terminus-font](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-fonts/terminus-font), which can then be used for GRUB as well.

`root #``emerge --ask media-fonts/terminus-font`
`root #``grub-mkfont -s 32 -o /boot/grub/fonts/terminus32b.pf2 /usr/share/fonts/terminus/ter-u32b.otb`

In the above example the filename chosen for `grub-mkfont` output is `terminus32b.pf2`. The font's path has to be accessible to GRUB during boot, so it should reside in the same mount point as GRUB does; this example uses `/boot/grub/fonts`. The font then has to be set as `GRUB_FONT` in `/etc/default/grub` in order to be used.

FILE **`/etc/default/grub`****Framebuffer related settings**
```
# Use a custom font, converted using grub-mkfont utility
GRUB_FONT="/boot/grub/fonts/terminus32b.pf2"

```

Updating the GRUB configuration file `grub.cfg` will then activate the configuration with the new font.

`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
## Installing a new kernel

Whenever a new kernel is installed, GRUB must be reconfigured to recognize it. This can be done using grub-mkconfig, as shown below, or can be [done manually](/wiki/GRUB2_Quick_Start#Manual_configuration "GRUB2 Quick Start").

 **Note**
Make sure the /boot partition is mounted for this step.
`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
```
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/kernel-3.3.8-gentoo
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.3.8-gentoo
Found linux image: /boot/kernel-3.2.12-gentoo
Found initrd image: /boot/initramfs-genkernel-x86_64-3.2.12-gentoo
done

```

Note that GRUB only needs to be reconfigured, not *reinstalled* to the boot drive's Master Boot Record (MBR). On the other hand, when GRUB itself has been upgraded it does need to be reinstalled on the boot drive, but usually does not need to be reconfigured.

### Automatic GRUB reconfiguration

If the package [sys-kernel/installkernel](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-kernel/installkernel) is installed and the [USE flag](/wiki/USE_flag "USE flag") grub is set, then on every installation of a kernel, grub-mkconfig will run automatically.

## After updating sys-boot/grub

After [sys-boot/grub](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-boot/grub) is updated (either explicitly or via a [world update](/wiki/Upgrading_Gentoo "Upgrading Gentoo")), the core boot files and modules should be reinstalled. This is mentioned in the following post-install message:

CODE
```
* Re-run grub-install to update installed boot code!
* Re-run grub-mkconfig to update grub.cfg!

```

To re-install these files, follow the steps in the relevant sections:

* [Installing GRUB for EFI](#Installing_GRUB_for_EFI)
* [BIOS with MBR](#BIOS_with_MBR)
* [BIOS with GPT](#BIOS_with_GPT)
* [Open Firmware (IEEE 1275) on PowerPC](#Open_Firmware_.28IEEE_1275.29_on_PowerPC)
* [Install on encrypted partition](#Install_on_encrypted_partition)

## Troubleshooting

 **See also**
For more troubleshooting, please refer to the **[Troubleshooting](/wiki/GRUB/Troubleshooting "GRUB/Troubleshooting")** sub-article.

Most of the issues can be resolved by ensuring that the partition layout is correct. Make sure enough space is available before the first partition of the disk, or optionally make sure that a *BIOS boot partition* is available. Also verify that /boot/grub/grub.cfg was correctly generated with grub-mkconfig, or generate one with a custom menu entry.

### os-prober not running

When running the grub-mkconfig command, os-prober is not running as expected, even though it is installed:

`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
```
Generating grub configuration file ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-5.11.14-gentoo-x86_64

```

This can be corrected by setting the GRUB\_DISABLE\_OS\_PROBER variable to `false` in /etc/default/grub file.

FILE **`/etc/default/grub`**
```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

```

Upon the next run, grub-mkconfig should find additional bootable partitions:

`root #``grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`
```

### Motherboard firmware not finding the .EFI file

Some especially older (pre-2020) motherboards from certain manufacturers seem to only support one location for PE32+ files in the EFI System Partition (ESP): the [fallback or removable media path](/wiki/EFI_System_Partition#Removable_media "EFI System Partition"). If this seems to be the case, GRUB's  file can be renamed and moved to the \EFI\BOOT directory of the ESP. First, make sure the ESP is mounted. Presuming it is mounted at /efi, as suggested in the Handbook, execute:

`root #``mkdir -p /efi/EFI/BOOT``root #``cp /efi/EFI/gentoo/grubx64.efi /efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi`

On a 32-bit EFI implementation use name `BOOTIA32.efi` instead:

`root #``cp /efi/EFI/gentoo/grubia32.efi /efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.efi`

Alternatively, the `--removable` option of grub-install can be used to generate this file automatically:

`root #``grub-install --efi-directory=/efi --removable`
```

This should aid the motherboard firmware in loading GRUB's executable. Reboot the system to see if the firmware now correctly loads GRUB.

### os-prober and UEFI in chroot

The [sys-boot/os-prober](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/sys-boot/os-prober) utility is used to discover alternate installs, such as Microsoft Windows. To function properly, it needs to have access to information from the live environment's udev to test for the EFI System Partition.

Run these commands in the host environment to provide the required files (example shows Gentoo mounted on /mnt/gentoo like in the Handbook):

`root #``mkdir -p /mnt/gentoo/run/udev``root #``mount -o bind /run/udev /mnt/gentoo/run/udev``root #``mount --make-rslave /mnt/gentoo/run/udev`
