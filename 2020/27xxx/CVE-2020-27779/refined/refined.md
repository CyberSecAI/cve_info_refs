Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27779:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `cutmem` command within the GRUB2 bootloader. This command, intended for privileged users, allows the removal of memory regions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Handling of Memory Removal:** The `cutmem` command does not properly enforce Secure Boot locking. This means that even when Secure Boot is enabled, an attacker can use `cutmem` to remove address ranges from memory.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker with local privileged access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Secure Boot:** By removing specific memory regions, an attacker can potentially bypass Secure Boot protections.
*  **Data Confidentiality and Integrity, System Availability:** The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Circumventing Secure Boot could potentially allow for the loading of unsigned code, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could also result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system with root privileges to execute the `cutmem` command within the GRUB2 environment.
*   **GRUB2 Command Line:** The attack is performed by utilizing the GRUB2 command line interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker must have root or equivalent privileges to utilize the `cutmem` command.
*   **Bootloader Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the GRUB2 bootloader environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in GRUB2 versions prior to 2.06.
*   The issue is related to Secure Boot bypass and involves the ability to manipulate memory mappings.
*  The fix involves ensuring that the `cutmem` command respects secure boot locking and does not allow memory regions to be removed by an attacker after triage about grub's memory layout.

This information is derived from multiple sources, including:

*   **Red Hat Bugzilla:** Specifically bug report 1900698, which directly references CVE-2020-27779 and details the vulnerability and its impact.
*   **Gentoo Security Advisory:** GLSA 202104-05, which lists CVE-2020-27779 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in a GRUB2 update.
*   **NetApp Security Advisory:** NTAP-20220325-0001, which lists CVE-2020-27779 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting NetApp products using Grub2.
*   **Fedora Project Mailing List:** The update notification for shim-15.4-4 mentions fixes for CVE-2020-27779, indicating the vulnerability is related to bootloader security and secure boot.

These sources confirm that the vulnerability is related to the `cutmem` command in GRUB2 and its ability to bypass Secure Boot mechanisms, and outline the potential for an attacker to gain control over the system.
