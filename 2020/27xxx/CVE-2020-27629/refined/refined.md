The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-27629.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Secure dependency parameters could be not masked in depending builds when there are no internal artifacts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Improper masking of secure dependency parameters in TeamCity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (secure dependency parameters) to unauthorized users in the context of builds that have no internal artifacts.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user could potentially access secure dependency parameters by observing the build process when no internal artifacts are involved.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the build process or build configurations within TeamCity. Specifically, access to builds that have no internal artifacts and where secure dependency parameters are used.
