- **Root cause of vulnerability**: APTARE versions prior to 10.5 included code that bypassed the normal login process when specific authentication credentials were provided to the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication weakness, login process bypass
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated user could login to the application and gain access to the data and functionality limited to that which the targeted user account has access. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, sending crafted authentication credentials to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need prior authentication or a privileged position, but needs to provide specific authentication credentials. The attack has high complexity, but can be executed over the network.
