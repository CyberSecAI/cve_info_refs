## Revisions

* 1.0: October 14, 2020, Initial release

## Summary

APTARE version 10.5 contains fixes for security issues. It is recommended that Veritas
customers update APTARE software to the latest 10.5 release.

## Description

APTARE 10.5 address the following security vulnerabilities:

| Issue | Description | Severity | Fixed version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Authorization Bypass](#issue1) | Critical | 10.5 |
| 2 | [Authentication Weakness - Login Process Bypass](#issue2) | High | 10.5 |

## Issues

Issue #1

Authorization Bypass

* CVE ID: [CVE-2020-27156](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27156)
* Severity: Critical
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

APTARE versions prior to 10.5 did not perform adequate authorization checks. This
vulnerability could allow for remote code execution by an unauthenticated user.

Issue #2

Authentication Weakness - Login Process Bypass

* CVE ID: [CVE-2020-27157](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27157)
* Severity: High
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.1 ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

APTARE versions prior to 10.5 included code that bypassed the normal login process when
specific authentication credentials were provided to the server. An unauthenticated user
could login to the application and gain access to the data and functionality limited to that
which the targeted user account has access.
