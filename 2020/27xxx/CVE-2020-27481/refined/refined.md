{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input passed via the 'id' parameter in the 'gdlr_lms_cancel_booking' function. This input is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any validation or escaping, leading to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Unauthenticated Access to Vulnerable Function"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to data breaches, manipulation of data, denial of service, or potentially complete compromise of the application's database.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the 'wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' endpoint. The vulnerable function, 'gdlr_lms_cancel_booking', is invoked by setting the 'action' parameter and the malicious SQL payload is passed through the 'id' parameter in the POST request body.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability as the function is accessible to unauthenticated users ('wp_ajax_nopriv' action hook).",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is located within the file `goodlayers-lms/include/lightbox-form.php`, specifically between lines 682 and 701. The plugin version affected is <= 2.1.4."
