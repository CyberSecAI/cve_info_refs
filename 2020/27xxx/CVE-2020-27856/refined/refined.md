  "summary": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data while parsing CR2 files in Foxit Studio Photo, which allows a read past the end of allocated structure potentially leading to information disclosure and code execution in the context of the current process. The attack requires user interaction via opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage."
