Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the SOAP API endpoint of NETGEAR R7450 routers. This endpoint listens on TCP port 80 by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The SOAP API endpoint lacks proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to disclose stored credentials.
*   **Further Compromise:** Disclosed credentials can lead to further compromise of the affected device and potentially the network it is connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Adjacent Attack:** The attack is performed from a network-adjacent position. This means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected router, or have network access to it.
*   **SOAP API Endpoint:** The attack targets the SOAP API endpoint of the router, which listens on TCP port 80.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be within the network or have access to the network where the vulnerable NETGEAR router is located.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication to the router.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-21-072 and ZDI-CAN-11559.
*   A fix for this vulnerability is included in the firmware update v1.2.0.76 for the R7450 router.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-08-21 and publicly released on 2021-01-18.
* The vulnerability is also identified as PSV-2020-0355 in the Netgear advisory.
