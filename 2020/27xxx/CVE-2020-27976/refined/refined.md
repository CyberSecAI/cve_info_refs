```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient filtering and misuse of the php mail function when sending emails to customers. Specifically, the `from` parameter in the mail function is not properly sanitized and is passed directly to the underlying `sendmail` command via the `-f` option, allowing for command injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to command injection vulnerability in the email functionality.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system by crafting a malicious `from` parameter. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors: By sending a specially crafted POST request to `admin/mail.php` including the malicious `from` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated in the admin area of the affected OScommerce Phoenix CE application, specifically version 1.0.5.4.
