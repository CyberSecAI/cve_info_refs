Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27870:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths within the `ExportToPDF.aspx` file. This insufficient validation allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw, where an attacker can manipulate user-supplied path parameters to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected SolarWinds Orion Platform installation. The attacker gains access to files within the context of the SYSTEM account, potentially exposing system and application configuration files, databases, and other sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** This vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers manipulate the path parameters passed within the HTTP request to the `ExportToPDF.aspx` to traverse directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the SolarWinds Orion Platform to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected SolarWinds Orion Platform installation.
