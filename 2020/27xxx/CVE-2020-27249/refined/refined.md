Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `CEscherObject::ReadNativeProperties` method of SoftMaker Office PlanMaker when parsing Microsoft Excel documents. Specifically, it occurs when handling the 0xf150 record type with a Version/Instance field of either 0x0004 or 0x0015. The method uses a `uint32` length field from the record header to copy data from the stream into a fixed-size buffer within a `CEscherObject`.  The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow due to trusting the provided length from the record's header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow due to the lack of proper bounds checking when copying data into a fixed-size buffer.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `uint32` length value from the record header is not validated against the size of the destination buffer, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Corruption:** Overwriting the heap leads to heap corruption and eventually to application crash. 
- **Potential Code Execution:** Heap-based buffer overflows can often be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Parsing:** The attack vector is through the parsing of a specially crafted Microsoft Excel document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation/Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a Microsoft Excel document.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to open the malicious document using the vulnerable software.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs within a specific parsing path involving `MsoDrawingGroup` (record type 0x00eb), `OfficeArtDggContainer` (record type 0xf000) and `record type 0xf150`.
- The specific vulnerable code is within the handler for the 0xf150 record when the version/instance is either 4 or 0x15.
- The destination buffer for the overflow has a size of 0x64 bytes.
- The provided proof-of-concept sets the length to a value exceeding this bound, resulting in a memory corruption.
- This vulnerability is one of several similar issues within the same method, differentiated only by different Version/Instance values, and different destination offsets.
