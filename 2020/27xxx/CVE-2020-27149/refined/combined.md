## Description

By exploiting the vulnerability, a user with “Read Only” privilege level can send requests via the web console to have the device’s configuration changed.
Scope
Scope changed: the security of serial devices connected to NPort can be affected

CVSS v3

0.0

([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

---

Exploitability

Remotely exploitable: network access to port 80/TCP or 443/TCP is required

## Attack complexity

Low skill level to exploit

## Privilege required

Low privilege level required: an account with “Read Only” privileges is required

## User interaction

None

## Impact

A remote attacker that has an account with “Read Only” privileges is able to execute requests, that should only be available to users with “Read Write” privileges.

Existence of exploit

Unknown

KL mitigation

Disable all unused user accounts with “Read Only” privileges

Set up a border firewall (or a similar network traffic control solution) passing traffic into the device’s network segment to allow traffic to ports 80/TCP, 443/TCP from authorized parties only.

Disable all unused network services

**Firewall.** Configure the firewall to restrict access to the industrial network in such a way that only essential communications from authorized sources are allowed. This will help reduce the attack surface. Make sure that the firewall restrictions do not affect core business workflows.

**VPN.** Use virtual private networks (VPN) to secure remote access to the industrial network. A VPN encrypts network traffic between VPN clients and the VPN server, as well as providing secure authorized access to local resources on the company’s internal network. Traffic encryption protects against traffic eavesdropping attacks, including man-in-the-middle (MitM) and other types of traffic analysis attacks.

**Network monitoring.** Implement a network intrusion detection solution (NIDS). A comprehensive IDS solution is capable of detecting unusual network connections and abnormal traffic sent to the device, providing timely information about various suspicious activities and sufficiently reducing the attacker’s chances of successful exploitation.

**Network segmentation.** Compartmentalize your network: implement network segmentation and strict access control for each segment to provide more comprehensive and effective protection against a wide range of threats. Proper network segmentation prevents attackers from reaching critical assets in the event of a network breach

###### SUMMARY

### NPort IA5000A Series Serial Device Servers Vulnerabilities

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-210401
* Version: V1.0
* Release Date: Apr 28, 2021
* Reference:
  + CVE-2020-27149, CVE-2020-27150, CVE-2020-27184, CVE-2020-27185
  + KLCERT-20-018, KLCERT-20-019, KLCERT-20-020, KLCERT-20-021

Multiple product vulnerabilities were identified in Moxa’s NPort IA5000A Series Serial Device Servers. In response to this, Moxa has developed related solutions to address these vulnerabilities.

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Improper Access Control (CWE-284) CVE-2020-27149, KLCERT-20-018 | Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to elevate the privilege level of the user controlled by them or to receive requests that require a higher privilege level. |
| 2 | Unprotected Storage of Credentials (CWE-256) CVE-2020-27150, KLCERT-20-019 | An attacker can extract authentication credentials from a configuration file sent over an insecure communication channel. The data extracted can subsequently be used to authenticate via Moxa Service and change the device’s configurations. |
| 3 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) CVE-2020-27184, KLCERT-20-020 | An attacker could read all data transferred between the client and the device if the communication is carried out over Telnet, including authentication credentials, device configuration data, the device version, and other sensitive data. |
| 4 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319) CVE-2020-27185, KLCERT-20-021 | Successfully exploiting this vulnerability could enable attackers to read all traffic sent when Moxa Service is enabled. This includes authentication data, device configurations, the device version, and other sensitive data. |

###### AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS

## Affected Products:

The affected products and firmware versions are shown below.

| Product Series | Affected Versions |
| --- | --- |
| NPort IA5150A/IA5250A Series | Firmware Version 1.4 or lower |
| NPort IA5450A Series | Firmware version 1.7 or lower. |

## Solutions:

Moxa has developed appropriate solutions to address the vulnerabilities. The solutions for affected products are shown below.

| Product Series | Solutions |
| --- | --- |
| NPort IA5000A Series | * For item 1 (CVE-2020-27149): NPort IA5150A/IA5250A Series, please upgrade to firmware version 1.5 or higher. For NPort IA5450A Series, please upgrade to firmware version 2.0 or higher. You can download it from [here](https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/software-and-documentation/search?psid=48846). * For item 2 (CVE-2020-27150), Moxa products support a pre-shared key function to encode the configuration file to mitigate this risk. Please refer to the Export/Import section in the user manual for more details. * For item 3 (CVE-2020-27184), Moxa products can disable the Telnet service to mitigate this risk. Please refer to the Console Settings section in the user manual for more details. Firmware version 1.5 or higher will disable Telnet by default on the NPort IA5150A/IA5250A Series. Firmware version 2.0 or higher will disable Telnet by default on the NPort IA5450A Series. * For item 4 (CVE-2020-27185), Moxa products can disable Moxa Service to mitigate this risk.
