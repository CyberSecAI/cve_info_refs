Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper access control within the Moxa NPort IA5000A series web interface. Specifically, a user with "Read Only" privileges can send requests that are intended for users with "Read Write" privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Broken access control (CWE-284). The web interface does not correctly enforce privilege separation, allowing lower-privileged users to perform actions they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with "Read Only" access can modify the device's configuration, potentially leading to:
    -  Changes to device settings.
    -  Compromise of serial devices connected to the NPort.
    -  Denial of service or other forms of disruption of the device's intended function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web console interface of the Moxa NPort IA5000A series, accessible via ports 80/TCP or 443/TCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- The attacker must possess valid "Read Only" user credentials.
- No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in firmware versions 1.4 or lower for NPort IA5150A/IA5250A series and firmware version 1.7 or lower for NPort IA5450A series.
- Moxa has provided firmware updates to address the issue (version 1.5 or higher for NPort IA5150A/IA5250A and version 2.0 or higher for NPort IA5450A).
- Mitigation also includes disabling unused read only accounts, limiting network access via a firewall and other standard network segmentation and security measures.
