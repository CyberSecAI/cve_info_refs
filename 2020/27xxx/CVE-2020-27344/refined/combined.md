3. Manage your CM Download from Left Side Admin Menu
4. All download are located on /cmdownloads/
5. User dashboard is located on /cmdownload/dashboard/
6. Before adding first download please define download categories

Note: You must have a call to wp\_head() in your template in order for the JS plugin files to work properly. If your theme does not support this you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).

## FAQ

> [More FAQ’s](//www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/downloadsmanager/#faq/)
>
> [Detailed User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/8-download-manager-cmdm)

### How can I customize the look & feel of the plugin?

In your template you can create a directory called “CMDM”. Inside this you can place a structure that is similar to the one inside “cm-download-manager/views/frontend/”. If the file can be found in your template directory, then it will have a priority. Otherwise, the default file from the plugin directory will be used.

After installing the plugin it was very unresponsive on mobile, I had layout issues, pages overflowing outside the viewport width. Other than that it just has a very outdated look to it, which isn’t shown on the CM website. The plugin looks like a site from the mid 2000s.
I requested help multiple times from their support, to which they just respond with links to their documentation with no reference, and half the time the link they send doesn’t even answer your query.
After having a painful week back and forth with their support I asked for a refund as I had to seek another plugin that actually did as asked.
They refused a refund, unsurprisingly once I asked for my money back they were very quick to respond telling me why I couldn’t get my money back. They wanted me to reinstall the plugin so they could address the issues I had brought to their attention a week before, absolutely laughable.
AVOID AVOID AVOID!

Do not buy any plugins from Creative Minds. Their plugins do not do what they claim and require you to download and install no less than 3-4 add-on plugins to get the functionality it should have out of the box. Plus once you have the now 4-5 plugins installed you will find it is missing one or more basic features that it really should have. For this particular plugin just trying to customize the user front end was impossible and after several emails to support I was told they would do it for me at a rate of $60 per hours and a minimum of 12 hours. There are always better options for less out there so please do your research before purchasing anything from Creative Minds. Oh and there is no demo or trial period so again do not waste your money because they will fight you for a refund when you realize they lied and their plugin isn’t capable of doing what you expected without hours of additional customization by their ridiculously slow “experts”.

# Warning about bidirectional Unicode text

* [code](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code/)
* [repos](https://github.blog/changelog/label/repos/)
* [security-and-compliance](https://github.blog/changelog/label/security-and-compliance/)

October 31, 2021

A warning is now displayed when a file's contents include bidirectional Unicode text. Such text can be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears in a user interface. For example, hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters can be used to swap segments of text in a file. This can cause code to appear one way and be interpreted or compiled another way.

![image](https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/1767415/139425260-6d62b200-d486-486e-94bf-e27a26523844.png?ssl=1)

This security issue is the topic of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) publication: [CVE-2021-42574](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42574). **If your use of bidirectional Unicode characters is intentional and not malformed, you can ignore the warning.**

To review a file for which this warning is displayed, open it in an editor that will display the hidden, bidirectional Unicode characters, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which highlights the characters by default. Then, verify that the characters are necessary and not disguising text that will be interpreted or compiled differently than it appears.

## [Pull Request Merge Queue Limited Beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-pull-request-merge-queue-limited-beta)

October 27, 2021

* [merge-queue](https://github.blog/changelog/label/merge-queue/)
* [pull-requests](https://github.blog/changelog/label/pull-requests/)

Pull Request Merge Queue is now available in limited beta. Learn more about the feature and how to request early access.

### Why a merge queue?

Maintaining high velocity and keeping your main branch green can be a challenge today. Many repositories try to do this by requiring all pull requests be up to date with the main branch before merging. This ensures the main branch is never updated to a commit that has not passed all required status checks, but forces developers to update (or rebase) their pull request branches multiple times and then wait for status checks to complete before trying to merge again. On some projects, status checks can take 30 or more minutes and if another pull request gets merged during this time, the process starts over (for everyone). This can have a significant impact on the overall velocity of the team and make it harder for developers to move onto their next task.

Merge Queue provides the benefits of requiring pull request branches to be up to date before merging, but without requiring developers to go through this process.

### How it works

Merge Queue works by validating different combinations of pull requests identified as “ready to merge” in parallel so that pull requests can merge efficiently and without the typical delays that exist between merges today.

![GIF of merge queue demo](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GitHub-merge-queue-demo.gif)

Once a pull request has been approved and has passed all required status checks, a user with write access in the repository can queue the pull request to be merged. The pull request branch does not need to be up to date with the base branch before being queued. The merge queue then creates a temporary branch that includes the pull request and any non-failing pull requests ahead of it in the queue. This branch is based on the latest version of the base branch and is what the history of the base branch will look like if it passes all required status checks. Assuming it does pass these checks, the base branch is fast-forwarded and the pull request is marked as merged.

### Early access

Merge Queue is currently available in limited beta. This gives us the opportunity to better understand your requirements as we improve the quality and capability of the feature. In the first phase of this beta, access to the feature is limited to a select number of organizations that meet certain requirements like having a consistently high volume of changes from multiple users being merged each day.

Organization admins can request early access for their organization by joining the waitlist: <https://github.com/features/merge-queue/signup>. You will need to provide the name of a repository in this organization that you plan on using merge queue on, but you will have the opportunity to test the feature on other repositories during the beta. We will contact you prior to onboarding to work through the details.

Early access will expand to more organizations over the coming months.

### Learn more

For the latest updates on this feature, see the [public roadmap issue](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/272) and [`#merge-queue` posts](https://github.blog/changelog/label/merge-queue/) in the GitHub Changelog.

## [New Codespaces features launching at Universe 2021](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-new-codespaces-features-launching-at-universe-2021)

October 27, 2021

* [api](https://github.blog/changelog/label/api/)
* [cli](https://github.blog/changelog/label/cli/)
* [codespaces](https://github.blog/changelog/label/codespaces/)
* [Universe](https://github.blog/changelog/label/universe/)

GitHub Codespaces allows teams and organizations to spin-up developer environments directly from a browser or through Visual Studio Code, without the hassle of setting up a brand new environment tailored to a specific repository.

We've been hard at work since our [general availability announcement in August](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-11-codespaces-is-generally-available-for-team-and-enterprise/) making Codespaces the best way for you to develop software, which is why we're so happy to announce several new features at GitHub Universe 2021.

We know that many developers use the `gh` CLI to speed up or fully automate daily tasks, and we've received dozens of requests to add Codespaces support to the CLI. As of today, the `gh codespace` (or `gh cs` for those saving keystrokes) command now allows developers to manage their codespaces from the GitHub CLI. In addition to codespace creation, listing, and starting/stopping, users can forward ports, set port visibility, SSH into their codespaces, and copy files to/from their codespaces.

```
# Create a new codespace via the CLI
gh codespace create --repo monalisa/octocat --branch main
```

We're especially excited about `ssh` access, as it allows developers who prefer to use editors like `vim` and `emacs` to more easily develop in Codespaces. Just `gh cs ssh` into your codespace and launch your editor of choice; we'll set up the environment and grab all your dotfiles so you're ready to develop in seconds.

```
# SSH into the codespace created above
gh codespace ssh -c monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r
```

Complimenting the CLI, we are also launching an API in beta. The API provides control plane operations around a user's codespaces including creating, starting/stopping, listing available machine types, and setting user secrets. These APIs will allow developers to build Codespaces integrations into their favorite editors and tools, as well as allow for additional automation around Codespaces.

```
# Stop a running codespace via the API
curl https://api.github.com/user/codespaces/monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r/stop \
  -H "Authorization: token <Personal Access Token>" \
  -X POST
```

We also know that security and privacy are critical, and we've gotten a lot of feedback on providing additional visibility options for forwarded ports beyond `public` and `private`. Today we're launching a third option: `org` visible ports, which are accessible to any user in the organization the codespace has been created in. This is great for securely collaborating with your teammates on new and exciting features in your codespaces.

```
# Make port 80 visible to all users in an org
gh codespace ports visibility 80:org -c monalisa-monalisa-octocat-1337h4x0r
```

Continuing with security improvements, we have also heard from developers having difficulty launching codespaces from devcontainers stored in private container registries. To make this easier, we are offering streamlined access to containers stored in the GitHub Container Registry; you no longer have to provide a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Speaking of devcontainers, we know that there's a wide gap between using a predefined devcontainer and building a custom devcontainer. To help make that transition a little easier, we're launching the ability to extend devcontainers with `features`, which include shells, package managers, programming languages, and other common tools. For example, adding Terraform to a supported base image is as easy as adding the following to your `devcontainer.json`.

```
"features": {
  "terraform": "latest"
}
```

If you have any feedback about these features, or Codespaces in general, we'd [love to hear from you](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/codespaces-feedback)!
