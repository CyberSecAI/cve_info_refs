Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27344:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `filename` parameter within the `Content-Disposition` header of a POST request. Specifically, the CM Download Manager plugin for WordPress does not sufficiently sanitize the filename when adding a new download.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Malicious code can be injected into the `filename` parameter, which is then reflected back in the response when the download is processed, potentially executing in the user's browser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `filename` parameter of the `Content-Disposition` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `filename` parameter, leading to the execution of the script in the victim's browser. This can result in:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and impersonating the user.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data that the user has access to.
    - **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or displaying fake login forms.
    - **Website Defacement:** Modifying the visual presentation of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited via a remote attack vector through the HTTP protocol.
- **POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/cmdownload/add/` endpoint.
- **`Content-Disposition` Header:** The malicious payload is injected into the `filename` parameter within the `Content-Disposition` header of the multipart/form-data request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/cmdownload/add/`) and the vulnerable parameter (`filename` in `Content-Disposition` header).
- **No Authentication Needed:** Based on the provided information, the XSS is triggered without needing authentication

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable page is located at `cmdownload/add/`.
- The malicious payload is inserted into the `filename` attribute of the `Content-Disposition` header:
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="CMDM_AddDownloadForm_package"; filename="users.doc<img src=a onerror=alert('XSS')>"
```
- The server processes the request, and the injected payload is reflected in the response, leading to XSS execution in the client's browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the CM Download Manager plugin before 2.8.0.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 2.8.0 and later versions of the plugin.
- The provided example demonstrates a simple alert as the XSS payload, but more complex and malicious payloads can be used.
