Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability within the R programming language's package manager, CRAN. This vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of installed source packages, specifically within the `tar.gz` archive format used for packaging.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is the ability to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) within the file paths embedded in the `tar.gz` archive. This allows an attacker to write files outside of the intended installation directory when the archive is extracted.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The R package installation process fails to properly sanitize or validate the file paths contained within the archive, leading to the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to any location on the file system that the user running the installation process has write permissions to.
*   **Code Execution:**  By overwriting legitimate system binaries, creating cron jobs, or writing SSH keys (`authorized_keys`) to the affected host, the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the package installation is done with elevated privileges (e.g., root), the attacker gains the ability to modify system-critical files and settings, leading to privilege escalation and complete system control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Packages:** Attackers can craft malicious R packages containing the path traversal payloads.
*   **Remote Repositories:** These malicious packages can be hosted on a custom repository, tricking users into downloading from a non-standard source.
*  **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability can also be exploited locally using the `R CMD INSTALL` feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Packages:** The attacker needs the ability to create `tar.gz` archives containing the path traversal payloads using tools like `evilarc`.
*   **Package Hosting:** The attacker must be able to host the malicious package, either on a custom repository or by replacing a legitimate package in an existing repository (less likely for the main CRAN repository but possible in local or custom repos)
*   **Social Engineering/Redirection:** The attacker needs to entice or trick a user into installing the malicious package.
*   **User Installation Permissions:** The attacker can leverage the privileges of the user who is installing the package, potentially leading to root compromise if the installation occurs with such privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects R versions 4.0.2 and prior, and is fixed in version 4.0.3.
*   The `evilarc` tool from GitHub is mentioned as a method for creating the malicious archives.
*   The exploit was successfully demonstrated using both `install.packages` with a remote repository and `R CMD INSTALL` locally.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Medium" risk level but can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
