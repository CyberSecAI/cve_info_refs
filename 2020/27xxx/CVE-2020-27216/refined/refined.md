  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-27216",
    "description": "On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "<= 9.4.32.v20200930",
      "<= 10.0.0.beta2",

    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the creation of temporary directories within a shared system temporary directory, where a local attacker can manipulate the creation process to gain unauthorized access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-378",
      "CWE-379"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation can lead to local privilege escalation. By winning the race condition, an attacker can gain read and write permissions to the temporary directory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files, enabling them to execute code out of this directory.",
     "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with access to the shared system temporary directory can exploit the race condition.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be a collocated user with the ability to observe and interact with the shared temporary directory."
