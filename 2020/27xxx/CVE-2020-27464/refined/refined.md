Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Unauthenticated RCE via `ajaxArchiveFiles.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Blind command injection in the `ext` parameter of the `ajaxArchiveFiles.php` file.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user-supplied input passed to a system command.
*   **Impact:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user (typically `apache`).
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `ajaxArchiveFiles.php` with a malicious payload in the `ext` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No authentication is required; the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rConfig instance.

**Vulnerability 2: Authenticated RCE via `ajaxEditTemplate.php`**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper sanitization when saving connection templates, allowing injection of PHP code into a file accessible via the web.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure file handling and lack of input validation. The application appends `.yml` to filenames, but an attacker can use `../` to place the php file in the webroot.
*   **Impact:** Remote attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker must be authenticated and send a POST request to `ajaxEditTemplate.php` with the PHP payload inside the `code` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker must be authenticated (or use the described auth bypasses).

**Vulnerability 3: Unauthenticated RCE via `updater.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient checks in the `updater.php` file that allows a malicious ZIP to be uploaded and installed, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of uploaded ZIP files during the update process
*   **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code via a modified update package.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to create a malicious update ZIP file, upload it to the server using `updater.php` via an HTTP GET request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No authentication is required; the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rConfig instance.

**Vulnerability 4: Unauthenticated Authentication Bypass via `userprocess.php` (User Creation)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `register` function in `userprocess.php` does not enforce authentication, allowing the creation of an administrative user account.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authentication checks on user creation function.
*   **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated attacker can create a new administrative account.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `userprocess.php` with user registration data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No authentication is required; the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rConfig instance.

**Vulnerability 5: Unauthenticated Authentication Bypass via `useradmin.inc.php` and `userprocess.php` (User Modification)**

*   **Root Cause:** Information leakage in `useradmin.inc.php` reveals existing user details and lack of authentication when modifying user accounts via `userprocess.php`.
*   **Weakness:** Information leakage and missing authentication checks on user modification functions.
*   **Impact:** Remote unauthenticated attacker can modify existing user accounts, including resetting passwords of administrative accounts.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker first sends an HTTP GET to `useradmin.inc.php` to retrieve usernames. Then, sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `userprocess.php` to modify a selected user account.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No authentication is required; the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rConfig instance.

**Summary of Exploitation Chain**

The advisory highlights that these vulnerabilities can be chained together:

1.  An unauthenticated attacker can use the authentication bypass in `userprocess.php` to create a new admin user.
2.  The attacker can then use the `ajaxArchiveFiles.php` vulnerability to achieve unauthenticated RCE, or log in using the created account and use the `ajaxEditTemplate.php` to achieve RCE. Alternatively the attacker can use the `updater.php` vulnerability to achieve RCE.
3.  Alternatively, an attacker can use information leakage on `useradmin.inc.php` and then modify an existing account including the admin password, using the unauthenticated user edit function on `userprocess.php` to gain access to the system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory mentions that `CVE-2019-19509` (related to command injection) was not resolved and remains present.
*   The vendor was not responsive to the security researchers and has not released a patch at the time of the advisory publication.
*   The advisory includes a Python exploit that demonstrates the vulnerability chain.
