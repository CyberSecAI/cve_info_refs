Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27304:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the CivetWeb web library when handling file uploads on non-Windows systems. Specifically, the `mg_handle_form_request` API does not sanitize user-controlled filenames, making it susceptible to directory traversal. The `mg_path_suspicious` function that checks for suspicious characters only does so for Windows backslashes and lacks path sanitization for Linux based systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, which allows an attacker to upload a file to an arbitrary location on the server file system, by providing a malicious filename containing path traversal sequences (e.g., "../").

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the web server is running with high privileges (e.g. as root) a successful path traversal attack can be used to write executable files to arbitrary locations. The attacker can overwrite existing files that may lead to code execution.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can create or overwrite files anywhere on the server's file system accessible to the user running the CivetWeb server.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Successful exploitation can compromise confidentiality (if sensitive data is exposed/overwritten), integrity (by overwriting legitimate system files), and availability (by corrupting system files and/or causing a denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Form Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint that uses the built-in HTTP form-based file upload mechanism.
- **Malicious Filename:** The attacker needs to embed path traversal sequences within the filename field of the HTTP form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CivetWeb server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication if the affected endpoint is publicly accessible or if the attacker has already obtained access to the service.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP form file upload requests, which can be achieved using command-line tools like `curl` or `wget`, web debug tools or custom programs.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in CivetWeb versions 1.8 to 1.14.
*   It specifically affects applications that directly use the `mg_handle_form_request` API and relies on the filename input argument to construct the output file path.
*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete check for path traversal sequences. The `mg_path_suspicious` function only checks path separators for windows builds, but not forward slashes for linux builds.
*   The vulnerability is demonstrated in the `embedded_c.c` example provided with the CivetWeb source code prior to version 1.15.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the path by removing dot segments as described in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-5.2.4) in addition to filtering path seperators `/` or `\` as defined in [RFC 7578](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7578#section-4.2)

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to CivetWeb version 1.15 or later. If unable to update, sanitize user-supplied filenames before using them to construct output paths, adhering to the recommendations of RFC 3986 and RFC 7578.
