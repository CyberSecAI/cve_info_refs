The provided content relates to CVE-2020-27173.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `rust-vmm/vm-superio` implementation of the serial console, emulating a UART port type 16550A, allows buffering an unlimited number of bytes from input sources when using the FIFO functionality. This unbounded buffering can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded memory allocation: The FIFO buffer in the serial console implementation could grow without limit when receiving input from the host side.
- Lack of input validation: The code did not check for the available space in the input buffer before enqueueing bytes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could send a large amount of data to the serial console, causing the host system to exhaust memory, potentially impacting all virtual machines running on the same host.
- Memory Pressure: If no rate limiting is applied, the host system may experience significant memory pressure due to the unbounded buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Host-side input: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending data to the serial console from the host side. This data is then buffered by `vm-superio` potentially consuming excessive memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the serial console from the host side. This could mean having control over the input stream directed to the emulated serial port. The attacker does not need to have access to the guest VM.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to `vm-superio` version 0.1.1, which includes a fix for this issue.
- Implement memory limits for the process using `vm-superio`.
- Apply rate limiting on the process standard input.
