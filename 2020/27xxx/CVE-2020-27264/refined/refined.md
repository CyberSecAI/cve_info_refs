- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The communication protocol of the insulin pump and its mobile applications uses deterministic keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of insufficiently random values in the key generation process for the communication protocol.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can brute-force the keys, allowing them to potentially access sensitive information, modify therapy settings, or cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via Bluetooth Low Energy by unauthenticated, physically proximate attackers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be physically close to the device and have the ability to intercept and analyze Bluetooth Low Energy communications.
