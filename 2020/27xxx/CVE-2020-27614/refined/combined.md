# CVE-2020-27614: macOS XPC privilege escalation

## Problem type

Incorrect Access Control / XPC LPE

## Description

AnyDesk 6.0.2 for macOS contains a privileged XPC service that does not properly validate client requests. An attacker can exploit this service and use the installation routines provided by it to change the permissions of an arbitrary file or directory in the filesystem.

## Impact

An attacker that can execute code with user permissions can use this vulnerability to change permissions of protected system directories. This can be used to escalate to root privileges through `launchd`.

## Affected products

The vulnerability affects AnyDesk for macOS versions 6.0.2 and older.

## Resolution

The vulnerability has been fixed in AnyDesk for macOS version 6.0.3.

selected. The Direct Draw renderer now draws the remote cursor as intended.
- A black image was shown instead of the remote screen in certain cases when "Use fast
render method" was selected in the view options. The image is rendered normally now
if this mode is selected.
- If a 16 bpp mode is selected, the Direct Draw renderer now tests if a 32 bpp mode is

the same fallback mechanism.

the keyboard layout of the remote user, AnyDesk can translate the keys. This enables
you to type special characters on your keyboard regardless if the remote keyboard
supports them. You can disable this feature in the main menu in case you want raw key
to be transmitted. This is useful for example for playing games which depend on the
hardware key code.
- Select "Auto-Adjust resolution" from the main menu during a session in order to change
the remote screen resolution to fit the dimensions of your local AnyDesk window. You
can use this feature as often as needed, for example after you maximized the AnyDesk
window. After the session ends, the remote resolution is restored to the original mode.
- Added privacy tab to user settings. You can now decide what to broadcast, your windows
user name or a custom one, your windows account image, a custom one or none.

frontend window when there are no more sessions.

after two seconds. Put the mouse cursor on the screen edge to display it again.

Instead, an error message box was displayed. AnyDesk uses the local app data folder as
a fallback now.

if available.

in the settings tab or the accept window.
- Fixed the remote mouse cursor position in original view mode.
New Features
- New performance option for rendering ("Use fast render method"). Set the checkbox as follows:
Checked: Always uses 16 bits per pixel for uploading (decreases required memory bandwidth).
Use this setting to speed up rendering on slow machines.
Indeterminate (default behaviour): Use the 16 bit render mode on single processor systems.
Unchecked: Never use 16 bits per pixel mode. Uncheck if you have a single processor machine
but the image quality is too low.

08.04.2015 - Beta 1.3.0
-----------------------
Fixed Bugs
- Improved the network code. This adds to the overall performance and fixes some random connection
freezes which occured in rare cases.
- Windows 8: When no mouse was attached to the machine being controlled, the mouse cursor was
missing. Provided a workaround which enables the mouse cursor during the AnyDesk session.
- Fixed a bug in the d3d renderer on multi monitor systems which caused the display to turn grey
when the AnyDesk window reached a certain size.

state was invalid which caused all permissions to be in the state disallowed.
Permissions can be changed before the session starts now.

settings.
