Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-27614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **incorrect access control** issue within a privileged XPC service in AnyDesk for macOS. This service does not properly validate client requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with user-level code execution to exploit the flawed XPC service to manipulate file system permissions, which can lead to a privilege escalation to root.
*   **XPC Service Vulnerability:** Specifically, the issue lies in how the XPC service handles incoming requests from clients, lacking sufficient validation of these requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File/Directory Permission Changes:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to change permissions of arbitrary files or directories in the file system.
*   **Root Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the permissions of protected system directories, an attacker can potentially escalate to root privileges, likely through interaction with `launchd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Code Execution:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target macOS system with user-level privileges to leverage the vulnerability.
*   **XPC Service Interaction:** The attacker then needs to interact with the vulnerable XPC service by sending specially crafted requests to trigger the permission manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Level Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a standard user on the macOS system where AnyDesk is installed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects AnyDesk for macOS versions 6.0.2 and older.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in AnyDesk for macOS version 6.0.3.

This analysis provides more details than the official CVE description, particularly in detailing how the attack works via the XPC service and its exploitation for privilege escalation through protected system directories.
