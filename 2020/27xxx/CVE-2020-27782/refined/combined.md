| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2020-11-24 19:48:03 UTC  ``` undertow handles certain query string characters improperly. An attacker could use this flaw to send a malicious request and trigger server errors, resulting in denial of service.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c2)  Jean-frederic Clere    2020-11-26 07:41:33 UTC  ``` The description is wrong, that is not a mod_cluster bug that is a general AJP problem, it affects mod_jk and mod_proxy_ajp. The work-around is easy: use HTTP/1.1 instead AJP to proxy to the back-end.  I confirm the problem is for example in <https://github.com/apache/httpd/blob/trunk/modules/proxy/ajp_header.c#L327> The query string is copied to AJP payload without any checks. and the same for mod_jk see <https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/blob/master/native/apache-2.0/mod_jk.c#L969>  The checks can also be done in the AJP of tomcat/undertow to reject URL/query string that are not conforming to RFC 7230 and RFC 398.  The problem needs to be reported to the ASF httpd and tomcat security lists for further investigations.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c3)  Jean-frederic Clere    2020-11-26 07:53:15 UTC  ``` Also note that only undertow seems to create a deny of service because it doesn't return anything to httpd and close the session abruptly and that marks the node as broken.  Tomcat AJP just wrongly process the illegal request so it is up to the webapp to process the query string and reject it.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c4)  Jean-frederic Clere    2020-11-26 08:08:48 UTC  ``` Also a note from <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBCS-1019>: "Note that the AJP issue was discovered by Richard Opalka <ropalka>"   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c26)  Kunjan Rathod    2021-01-25 06:17:05 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The issue can be mitigated by using HTTP/1.1 instead of AJP to proxy to the back-end.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-25 16:19:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2021:0250 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0250](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0250)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-25 16:29:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2021:0246 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0246](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0246)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-25 16:33:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2021:0247 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0247](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0247)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-25 16:38:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.3 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2021:0248 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0248](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0248)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1901304#c32)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-01-25 16:47:10 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
