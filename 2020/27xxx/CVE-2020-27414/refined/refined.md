  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Mahavitaran Android application transmits user credentials (username and password) as URL parameters during the login process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure communication of sensitive data",
      "Credentials sent as URL parameters",
      "Lack of encryption or secure transmission of credentials"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks",
      "Interception of network traffic",
      "Exposure through server logs or referrer headers",
      "Browser history or proxy software"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to intercept the network traffic between the application and the server, which can be done by being on the same network as the user or having access to a network device through which the user traffic is routed. Also, having physical access to a device that has logged into this app would grant the attacker access to the credentials"
