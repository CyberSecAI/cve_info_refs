December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill! Pathetic app and overall service!2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR6aEhEgEf3QqKFtkt_DSqw5ZNfFQAg3ZqnJ8dIMZ8b4kZEHSP=s32-rw)Gaurav Gulati*more\_vert*

[3 Comments on CVE-2020-13474: NCH Express Accounts- Privilege Escalation](https://cvewalkthrough.com/cve-2020-13474-nch-express-accounts-privilege-escalation/#comments)[Uncategorized](https://cvewalkthrough.com/category/uncategorized/) [tp9222@gmail.com](https://cvewalkthrough.com/author/tp9222gmail-com/)[December 12, 2020June 25, 2023](https://cvewalkthrough.com/cve-2020-13474-nch-express-accounts-privilege-escalation/)

**Vulnerable Software:**NCH Express Accounts

Vulnerability: Privilege Escalation

**Affected Version:** 8.24 and prior

**Vendor Homepage:** <https://www.nchsoftware.com/>

**CVE:** CVE-2020-13474

**CVE Author:** Tejas Nitin Pingulkar

**Exploit Available:** [Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMQrelwFy8s)

**About Affected Software**

Express Accounts is professional business accounting software, perfect for small businesses needing to document and report on incoming and outgoing cash flow, including sales, receipts, payments, and purchases.

**Additional Information**

NCH Express Accounts software allows you to access it over the web.

A web interface provides three types of user

* Administrator
* User
* Viewer

The administrator user has access to all modules, including Create a new invoice, Create a new quote, Create new sales order, Create new purchase order, Apply customers payment, View Credit notes, Enter new accounts payable, view chart of Accounts, Make a Payment, Receive a payment, Add new item, Add new customer, Suppliers list, Add/Edit users.

User with viewer privileges don’t have access to above-mentioned functionalities by forceful browsing. We will access admin modules using viewer user privileges

**Exploit**

I have created below users for POC

Admin user: admin@tejas.com

Viewer user: lowuser@tejas.com

As demonstrated in video, “chart of accounts” has only one entry, and lowuser@tejas.com don’t have access to “chart of accounts” functionality (or any other module mentioned above) reference video [2:14 min]

login as low privileged user and enter the below URL

http://[website:port]/acclist

Click add new account

fill in all details click okay

Via forceful browsing, we were able to add an entry as low user

Similarly below via forceful browsing, we can access below mentioned functions

Add New Invoice: http://[website:port]/invoiceprop?onok=invoicelist&oncancel=invoicelist

Add New Quote: http://[website:port]/quoteprop?onok=quotelist&oncancel=quotelist

Add New Sales Order: http://[website:port]/orderprop?onok=orderlist&oncancel=orderlist

Add New Purchase Order: http://[website:port]/porderprop?onok=porderlist&oncancel=porderlist

Payment:http://[website:port]/porderprop?onok=paymentlist&oncancel=paymentlist

Credit Notes:http://[website:port]/creditnotelistperiod

Account Payable: http://[website:port]/accpayable?onok=billlist&oncancel=billlist

Chart of Accounts: http://[website:port]/acclist (video POC)

Payments and Purchases: http://[website:port]/cashtxn?payment=1

Receipts and Deposits: http://[website:port]/cashtxn?payment=0

Add New Item: http://[website:port]/itemprop?onok=itemlist&oncancel=itemlist

Add New Customer: http://[website:port]/customerprop?onok=customerlist&oncancel=customerlist

Suppliers List: http://[website:port]/supplierlist

[No Comments on CVE-2020-35398: UTI Mutual fund Android Application- Username Enumeration](https://cvewalkthrough.com/cve-2020-35398-uti-mutual-fund-android-application-username-enumeration/#respond)[Uncategorized](https://cvewalkthrough.com/category/uncategorized/) [tp9222@gmail.com](https://cvewalkthrough.com/author/tp9222gmail-com/)[September 23, 2021June 25, 2023](https://cvewalkthrough.com/cve-2020-35398-uti-mutual-fund-android-application-username-enumeration/)

**Vulnerable Software:** UTI Mutual fund Android Application

**Vulnerability:**Username Enumeration

**Affected Version:** 5.4.28

Patch: Not Released (03-December-2021)

**Vendor Homepage:** [https://utimf.com/](https://www.nchsoftware.com/)

**CVE:** CVE-2020-11561

**CVE Author:** Tejas Nitin Pingulkar

**Exploit Available:** POC available

**About Affected Software**

Investing in Mutual Funds is now easy with the UTI MF (UTI Mutual Funds) App. It gives you a hassle-free experience to invest in any mutual fund scheme of your choice from anywhere, anytime, with just a few clicks. The paperless transactions allow new investors to start a SIP or invest a lumpsum with ease.

**Exploit**

Input an incorrect username (one that doesn’t exist), and the application will respond with an error message “We are unable to recognize the use user id entered.” If the valid username is entered and an invalid password is provided, application responds with “the password entered is incorrect,” which assists the attacker in enumerating valid usernames.

**Proof Of Concept**

The first screenshot shows that the user exists

The second screenshot shows that the user does not exist

| backstage — backstage | @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default Backstage software templates. In affected versions a malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template is able to manipulate the template in a way that writes files to arbitrary paths on the scaffolder-backend host instance. This vulnerability can in some situation also be exploited through user input when executing a template, meaning you do not need write access to the templates. This method will not allow the attacker to control the contents of the injected file however, unless the template is also crafted in a specific way that gives control of the file contents. This vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`. This attack is mitigated by restricting access and requiring reviews when registering or modifying scaffolder templates. | 2021-11-29 | [5.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-43783&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-43783](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-43783)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-mg3m-f475-28hv)[MISC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/f9352ab606367cd9efc6ff048915c70ed3013b7f) |

The problem was that validation was happening in the check\_prereg\_key\_and\_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ – meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register.

| bluez — bluez | An issue was discovered in bluetoothd in BlueZ through 5.48. The vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC\_ATTR\_REQ by the SDP implementation. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking arbitrary heap data. The root cause can be found in the function service\_attr\_req of sdpd-request.c. The server does not check whether the CSTATE data is the same in consecutive requests, and instead simply trusts that it is the same. | 2021-11-29 | [3.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2019-8921&vector=AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2019-8921](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2019-8921)[MISC](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-linux-bluez-information-leak-and-heap-overflow/)[CONFIRM](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211203-0002/) |
