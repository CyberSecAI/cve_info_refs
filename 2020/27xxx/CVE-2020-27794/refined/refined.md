Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a double free error. The `core->table_query` pointer is freed in two different places without proper nullification:
1. When the `in` command is executed in `cmd_info.c:cmd_info()`.
2. During the cleanup process in `core.c:r_core_fini()`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The same memory location pointed to by `core->table_query` is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- **Lack of Nullification:** After freeing `core->table_query` in `r_core_fini`, the pointer is not set to `NULL`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The double free leads to a program crash, as shown in the error message: `*** Error in `r2': free(): invalid pointer: 0x00007fffed1bcd00 ***`
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While a simple crash is the immediate impact, double frees can sometimes be leveraged for more serious vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command Sequence:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of radare2 commands, `in 0`, `oc 0`, `in 0`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Direct radare2 access:** The attacker needs to have direct access to a vulnerable version of radare2 and the ability to execute commands.

**Technical Details:**

- The `in` command, within `cmd_info.c:cmd_info()`, frees the existing `core->table_query` and then allocates a new value based on the provided input.
- The `oc` command, which triggers `core.c: r_core_fini` during radare2 exit, also frees the `core->table_query` which was previously freed by `in`.
- The fix implemented in commit `cb8b683758edddae2d2f62e8e63a738c39f92683` replaces the `free` call with `R_FREE` which also sets the pointer to NULL after freeing it.

This detailed information confirms the vulnerability and provides insights into its exploitation and fix.
