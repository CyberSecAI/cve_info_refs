Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27181

**Description:** The web application uses a Java applet for editing marketing materials. In the decompiled source-code of the applet a hardcoded AES key has been identified. This key can be exploited to accomplish the account takeover vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27179.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Hardcoded AES key within the Java applet used for password reset token encryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key.
- Lack of proper key management practices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The hardcoded key allows an attacker to generate valid password reset tokens for any user.
- This enables the attacker to reset the passwords of arbitrary accounts and gain unauthorized access to those accounts (account takeover - CVE-2020-27179).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to decompile the Java applet to extract the hardcoded AES key.
- Once the key is obtained, they can craft malicious password reset requests by generating valid password reset tokens for any user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access and decompile the Java applet.
- Basic understanding of cryptography and token generation.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is directly linked to and enables the account takeover vulnerability (CVE-2020-27179).
- The vulnerability was found in version 2019.045 of publiXone.
- It was fixed in version 2020.015.
