Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-27839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ceph-dashboard frontend application stores the JSON Web Token (JWT) used for user authentication in the browser's localStorage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage:** Using localStorage for sensitive data like JWTs makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, they can access the JWT stored in localStorage.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability stems from the potential for XSS attacks. If any of the application's dependencies are compromised or other injection vectors are found, an attacker could potentially steal the JWT.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** If the JWT is stolen, an attacker can impersonate the user and perform actions within the Ceph dashboard, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain complete access to the Ceph dashboard and all its functionality using the stolen JWT.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XSS Attacks:** Malicious JavaScript injection into the ceph-dashboard application.
- **Compromised Dependencies:** If any of the npm or other dependencies are compromised.
- **Injection through translation files:** although this approach was not successful, it is mentioned as a possible attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to find a way to inject JavaScript into the ceph-dashboard web application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Ceph dashboard interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The suggested mitigation was to stop using localStorage for JWT storage and to use secure cookies with appropriate flags (secure, HttpOnly, SameSite).
-  The issue was addressed by storing the JWT in an HTTPOnly cookie and employing SameSite=Strict flag for cookie security along with custom `Accept` header for added protection.
- The vulnerability was fixed in ceph-dashboard versions 14.2.17 and 15.2.9.
- Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 is not affected as it does not use authentication for the dashboard.
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments use the ceph package directly from the Ceph channel and will not be updated at this time.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) 4 shipped ceph package for the usage of RHOCS 4.2 only which has reached End of Life.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 does not include the ceph dashboard component.
