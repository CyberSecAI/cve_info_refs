{
  "CVE-2020-27781": {
    "Root cause": "User credentials could be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "An OpenStack Manila user can request access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users.",
      "The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers.",
      "All users of the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key."
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential privilege escalation. An attacker can target any resource that the compromised user has access to, including admin users, potentially compromising the Ceph administrator.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An OpenStack Manila user requests access to a share."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs to be a user in an OpenStack Manila project.",
      "The attacker requires knowledge of CephFS and OpenStack Manila interactions."
    ]
  }
