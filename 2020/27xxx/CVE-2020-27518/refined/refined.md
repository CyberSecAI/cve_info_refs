Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27518 (though not explicitly stated in the content, the context strongly suggests this is the vulnerability being described.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windscribe VPN application allowing users to specify custom OpenVPN configuration files. These config files are then processed by an OpenVPN executable that runs with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Configuration:** Windscribe allows users to provide arbitrary OpenVPN configuration files without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Privileged Execution:** The OpenVPN executable, which parses user-provided configurations, runs with SYSTEM privileges.
- **`script-security` Directive:** The OpenVPN configuration directive `script-security` can be used to specify external scripts to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage a crafted malicious OpenVPN configuration file to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This effectively allows the attacker to gain full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious OpenVPN Configuration File:** The attacker crafts a custom OpenVPN configuration file that contains malicious script directives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the Windscribe VPN application is installed.
- **Ability to Provide Config:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious OpenVPN configuration file to the Windscribe application.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content references the OpenVPN manual, specifically mentioning the `script-security` directive and provides a proof of concept using a batch script (`payload.bat`). This further clarifies the attack mechanism. The vulnerability is present in all versions of Windscribe VPN prior to v2.02.10.
