Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Synology Router Manager (SRM) using HTTP instead of HTTPS to transmit sensitive credentials when updating Dynamic DNS (DDNS) information with the dnsExit provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information: The `dnsexit.php` script sends the dnsExit username and password in the URL query parameters over an unencrypted HTTP connection. This exposes the credentials to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A successful man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack allows an attacker to intercept the HTTP request and steal the dnsExit credentials.
- Account Takeover:  By obtaining the credentials, an attacker can take control of the registered subdomain associated with the victim's dnsExit account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack: An attacker positioned between the Synology router and the dnsExit server can intercept network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Proximity: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Synology router and the dnsExit server. This could be on the local network or on the path to the external dnsExit server.
- Passive Eavesdropping: The attacker passively listens to the communication to capture the credentials sent in cleartext.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Synology SRM versions before 1.2.4-8081.
- The vulnerability is specific to the dnsExit DDNS provider.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a moderate severity with a CVSS v3 score of 6.5.
