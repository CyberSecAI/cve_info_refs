Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Kamailio handles SIP INVITE requests containing duplicate header fields. Specifically, the `build_local_reparse` function in `t_msgbuilder.c` does not correctly manage duplicate headers like CSeq, To, From, and Call-Id during the parsing/rebuilding of the SIP message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code doesn't adequately validate the presence of duplicate critical SIP headers (CSeq, To, From, Call-Id). It attempts to detect them using flags, but the logic is flawed and allows for the insertion of duplicate headers.
*   **Memory Corruption:** When duplicate headers are present, the `build_local_reparse` function can overwrite memory, leading to a crash. This is due to the function attempting to append data to a buffer that may have insufficient space. The issue manifests as a heap buffer overflow. Specifically, the overwrite occurs within the quick memory (qm) allocator, as shown by the "qm_debug_check_frag()" error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious actor can trigger a server crash by sending INVITE requests containing specific duplicate header fields leading to a denial of service condition. This prevents the server from processing legitimate requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network by sending crafted SIP INVITE messages to the Kamailio server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target Kamailio server.
*   **SIP Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of the SIP protocol to construct malformed INVITE requests with duplicate headers.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**

*   The fix was addressed in version `5.2.1-1+deb10u1` for Debian 10 buster.
*   The issue was discovered through fuzzing with tools like AFL, which helped identify the crash scenario.
*   The commit `ada3701d22b1fd579f06b4f54fa695fa988e685f` on the kamailio git repository addresses the vulnerability by preventing the addition of duplicate headers in local requests.
*   The crash occurs within the `build_local_reparse` function in `src/modules/tm/t_msgbuilder.c`, specifically around line 337, where memory is corrupted due to the flawed header duplication check.
*   The crash is triggered when the server attempts to build a new local request or ACK by re-parsing an existing message and adds duplicate headers
*   The provided GDB output and the crash log clearly show the memory corruption occurring during the memory reallocation (`__memmove_sse2_unaligned_erms`) and the following crash (`qm_debug_check_frag`).
