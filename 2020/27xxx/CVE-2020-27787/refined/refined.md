{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A crafted input file can cause a segmentation fault in `PackLinuxElf64::invert_pt_dynamic` during the unpacking process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the handling of dynamic section data within the ELF file parsing logic of UPX. Specifically, it occurs when accessing the symbol value at line 5173 in `p_lx_elf.cpp` during the `invert_pt_dynamic` function. There is insufficient validation of the input data, leading to an out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted input file can lead to a segmentation fault, causing the UPX tool to crash during unpacking. This could be exploited to cause a denial of service. It's important to note that this is not remote code execution but rather a crash during a specific UPX operation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted ELF file given as input to the UPX tool, specifically when the -d option is used to decompress.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious ELF file as input to the UPX tool. There's no mention of the need for special privileges or network access. Simply running the upx tool with a specially crafted input file is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_function": "PackLinuxElf64::invert_pt_dynamic at p_lx_elf.cpp:5173",
    "affected_versions": "UPX 3.96 (latest version as of Jan 14, 2020). Specifically the commit `1bb93d4`.",
    "poc": "A proof-of-concept file (`upx_poc2`) is available [here](https://github.com/cxy20103657/software_poc/blob/master/upx_poc2).",
    "debug_information": "The provided debug information pinpoints the exact crash location at `acc_ua_get_le64` within the `miniacc.h` header file at line 6208. This occurs after a series of function calls originating from the `PackLinuxElf64::invert_pt_dynamic` function during the unpacking process.",
    "related_issue": "[Issue #333](https://github.com/upx/upx/issues/333) contains a detailed description of the vulnerability."
