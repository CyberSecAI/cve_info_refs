Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27560:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a division-by-zero error within the `OptimizeLayerFrames` function in the `MagickCore/layer.c` file of the ImageMagick library. This occurs when the `curr->ticks_per_second` value is zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Division by Zero:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation to ensure the divisor `curr->ticks_per_second` is not zero before performing division.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** A crafted input file can cause `curr->ticks_per_second` to be zero, thus triggering the division by zero.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The division-by-zero error leads to a crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted image file as input to ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious image file to an application that uses the vulnerable ImageMagick library.
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction (opening/processing the image file) is needed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-13454, indicating a pattern of similar issues in ImageMagick.
*   The fix involves preventing the division-by-zero by validating that `curr->ticks_per_second` is not zero, as can be seen in the provided patch:
    ```c
    time +=(size_t) (curr->delay*1000*
             PerceptibleReciprocal((double) curr->ticks_per_second));
    ```
    
* The fix was applied in multiple versions of the software across different distributions, including SUSE and openSUSE, and Debian.
