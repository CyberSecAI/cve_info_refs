December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill! Pathetic app and overall service!2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR6aEhEgEf3QqKFtkt_DSqw5ZNfFQAg3ZqnJ8dIMZ8b4kZEHSP=s32-rw)Gaurav Gulati*more\_vert*

**Exploit**

Authentication bypass using OTP Fixation

OTP reset functions use the id field

An attacker can manipulate the OTP ID field as each OTP id has a fixed OTP code.

Let’s generate OTP for a password reset.

Now as demonstrated in Video POC below OTP ID is 7310828, and Correct OTP for this id is 565449

Now we know that for OTP ID 7310828 Correct OTP is 565449; hence we can use the same OTP ID and OTP pair to reset any user account and take full control.
