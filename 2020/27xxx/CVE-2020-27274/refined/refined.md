Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-27274:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions within some parsing functions of the affected product. Specifically, the functions do not check the return value of `malloc`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure to check the return value of `malloc`. This can lead to a situation where `malloc` fails (returns NULL), but the program continues without handling this error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service (DoS). When `malloc` fails and the return value isn't checked, the thread handling the message is forced to close, which can lead to a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the affected product that trigger the vulnerable parsing functions.
- No specific privileges or user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability
- Low skill level required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is the Honeywell Matrikon OPC UA Tunneller.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 6.3.0.8233.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely with a low complexity.
