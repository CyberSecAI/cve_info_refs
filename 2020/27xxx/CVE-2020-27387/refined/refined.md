Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27387:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-27387. The description across the different sources consistently points to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS that allows remote code execution.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is an insufficient file extension check within the HorizontCMS file manager.
   - While there's a blacklist for dangerous file extensions during the initial upload, the rename function within the file manager does not enforce the same restrictions. This discrepancy allows a user to upload a file with a benign extension (e.g., .txt) and then rename it to a malicious executable one (e.g., .php), bypassing the initial upload checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate file extensions during renaming, permitting the upload of arbitrary files after an initial check bypass.
   - **Insufficient Input Validation:** The rename function lacks adequate checks to prevent malicious file extensions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and rename a malicious PHP file, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
   - **Full system compromise:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise and data breaches.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited remotely through HTTP requests to the web application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with access to the file manager in HorizontCMS.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the vulnerable HorizontCMS instance.

**Additional Notes (from the provided content):**
*   The vulnerability is present in HorizontCMS version 1.0.0-beta and prior.
*   A patch has been implemented to address this issue; however, the version number remains at 1.0.0-beta (as of the time the vulnerability was reported).
*   Metasploit module: `exploit/multi/http/horizontcms_upload_exec` is available, demonstrating the exploitability of this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is of high value to attackers because it is easy to weaponize and gives privileged access to the system.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 (High)

In summary, CVE-2020-27387 stems from a flaw in HorizontCMS that bypasses file extension validations during file renaming, leading to a high-impact vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
