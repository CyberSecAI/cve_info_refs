Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Skype ID" field during user profile editing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the "Skype ID" field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users, including administrators.
  - **Cookie Stealing:** The injected script can be crafted to steal user cookies, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate other users or gain unauthorized access.
  - **Other Malicious Activities:** The attacker can perform other malicious actions depending on the attacker crafted XSS payload, such as redirecting to a malicious page or performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **User Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Skype ID" field during user registration or profile editing.
  - **Web Browser:** The malicious script is executed when the victim visits a page that displays the attacker's profile data, including the crafted "Skype ID". This includes both the manage user section of the admin panel and on the home page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the platform.
  - **Ability to Edit Profile:** The attacker needs the ability to edit their profile, specifically the "Skype ID" field.
