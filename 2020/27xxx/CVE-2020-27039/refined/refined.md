Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27039:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit message "Make system-generated FGS notification PendingIntents immutable" indicates the vulnerability arises from the system generating Foreground Service (FGS) notifications with mutable PendingIntents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Mutable `PendingIntent` objects associated with FGS notifications
   - A mutable `PendingIntent` allows modification of the intent's data and flags by a third party, potentially causing unintended actions or information leaks
 
**Impact of exploitation:**

- A malicious application could potentially modify the `PendingIntent` associated with an FGS notification, potentially leading to:
   - Executing arbitrary code when the user interacts with the notification.
   - Causing the application to perform unauthorized actions.
   - Information disclosure due to modification of data within the intent.

**Attack vectors:**

- A malicious application on the same device could exploit the vulnerability to intercept and modify the `PendingIntent` of a system-generated FGS notification.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device. The application does not seem to require special permissions.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided information is a commit message and does not go into significant detail about the technical implementation of the vulnerability.
- The fix implemented by the commit makes the generated PendingIntents immutable.
