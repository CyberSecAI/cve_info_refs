### CVE-2020-27840
The provided content describes a heap corruption vulnerability in Samba, specifically affecting the parsing of Distinguished Names (DNs) in LDAP bind requests.

- **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Samba handles DN strings that contain arbitrary amounts of space around the component values. While these spaces are meant to be ignored, they can cause a zero-byte to be written into out-of-bounds memory when processing invalid DN strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Heap corruption due to out-of-bounds write
    - Improper input validation of DN strings with spaces
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - The most likely outcome of an attack is a crash of the Samba AD DC LDAP server.
    - There is a potential for non-fatal data corruption, though targeted exploitation is difficult.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can exploit the vulnerability through LDAP bind requests by sending crafted DN strings as the username.
    - Other methods to trigger the bug remotely may exist, but LDAP bind is considered the easiest unauthenticated method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An anonymous attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing valid credentials.
    - The attacker needs to send a crafted DN string during an LDAP bind request.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is present in all Samba versions since 4.0.0.
- The issue is related to the `ldb_handler_fold()` function, which is used for case-insensitive string handling in Active Directory.
- Patches and updated versions (4.14.2, 4.13.7, and 4.12.14) have been released to address this issue.
-  The CVE is also tracked in several distributions (Debian, Fedora and Gentoo) where it causes a similar out of bounds access/crash.
