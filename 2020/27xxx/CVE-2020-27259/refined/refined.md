{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer during the parsing of NCI files by the CX-Position application.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Untrusted pointer dereference",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by having a user open a malicious NCI file or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious NCI file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page."
