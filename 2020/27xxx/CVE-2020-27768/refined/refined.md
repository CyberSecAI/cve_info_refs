Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-27768:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-range representable value of type `unsigned int` in `MagickCore/quantum-private.h`. This means a calculation or data manipulation within the `MagickCore/quantum-private.h` file is resulting in a value that cannot be correctly stored within an `unsigned int` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Integer overflow or out-of-range values. Specifically, the value exceeds the maximum limit for an `unsigned int` type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is **undefined behavior**.  This could lead to various issues, including application crashes or other unspecified impacts. The provided Red Hat bugzilla entry marks this as **Low severity** because no specific impact was demonstrated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when ImageMagick processes a crafted input file designed to cause the out-of-range value during processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image or input file that ImageMagick processes, triggering the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.9-0 and also addressed in Debian LTS updates.
-  The vulnerability exists in `MagickCore/quantum-private.h`.
-  The upstream patch was found at <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/95d4e94e0353e503b71a53f5e6fad173c7c70c90>
