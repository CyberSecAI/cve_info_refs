Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3096-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany

Package        : ghostscript
Version        : 9.27~dfsg-2+deb10u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-27792

A heap-based buffer over write vulnerability was found in GhostScript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter. An attacker could trick a user to open a crafted
PDF file, triggering the heap buffer overflow that could lead to memory
corruption or a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
9.27~dfsg-2+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.

For the detailed security status of ghostscript please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ghostscript>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
