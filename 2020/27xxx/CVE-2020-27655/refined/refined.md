Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27655

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in the iptables rules within the Synology Router Manager (SRM) operating system. Specifically, packets originating from the QuickConnect VPN interface (tun1000) are accepted without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control for traffic originating from the QuickConnect VPN interface.  The iptables rules are not configured to filter or restrict this traffic, resulting in unrestricted communication with any service on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unrestricted Access to Internal Services:** An attacker can bypass intended access restrictions and communicate with any service running on the Synology router, despite the user's QuickConnect service configuration (which is intended to restrict access to specific services).
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining unrestricted access, an attacker can leverage other vulnerabilities (e.g. TALOS-2020-1065) to achieve more severe impacts such as arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Access to internal services could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored on or processed by the router.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The vulnerability can be exploited together with other vulnerabilities (e.g. TALOS-2020-1064) to communicate with devices connected to the VPN.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **QuickConnect VPN:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via the QuickConnect VPN connection. This connection can be established remotely by using the QuickConnect service.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to establish a QuickConnect VPN connection to the target router. This could be achieved by owning a router and connecting to it via SSH or, alternatively, using the vulnerability described in TALOS-2020-1058.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote network access to the target Synology router.
*   **QuickConnect ID:** The attacker needs to know or be able to obtain a valid QuickConnect ID for the target router.
*   **Exploitation of other vulnerabilities (optional):** The attacker may need to chain this vulnerability with others to achieve root privileges, e.g. exploiting TALOS-2020-1065.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Synology SRM version 1.2.3 RT2600ac 8017-5.
*   Synology has addressed the vulnerability in SRM version 1.2.4-8081 and later.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 6.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
*   The related CWE is CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
