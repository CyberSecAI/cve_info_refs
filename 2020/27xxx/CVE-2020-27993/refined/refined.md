{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows downloading files using a 'filename' parameter without proper sanitization, leading to local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download any readable file from the server without permission or login session.",
   "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a path traversal sequence in the 'filename' parameter of the 'download' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application and the ability to manipulate the URL."
