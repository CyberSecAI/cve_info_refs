Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27055:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-27055 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Wi-Fi settings of Android. The vulnerability arises from a lack of validation in the domain field when users choose a CA certificate for a Wi-Fi network. This can lead to the saving of a Wi-Fi configuration with an empty domain, which is not desired when using a CA certificate for server validation.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the insufficient validation of the domain field in the Wi-Fi settings when a CA certificate is selected for a Wi-Fi network. The application doesn't enforce the entry of a domain name before saving the configuration, which can then be exploited

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Lack of input validation: Specifically, the domain field is not checked for emptiness when a CA certificate is selected.
- Incorrect configuration: The ability to save a Wi-Fi configuration with a CA certificate and an empty domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially induce a user to connect to a Wi-Fi network that lacks proper server validation, potentially leading to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This would make the user susceptible to information disclosure. This vulnerability does NOT grant remote code execution, elevation of privilege, or denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves manipulating the user interface (Settings) for configuring Wi-Fi networks. A user could install a certificate and then attempt to connect to a Wi-Fi network. If they do not enter the domain they will connect insecurely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have an understanding of the Android Wi-Fi settings interface and the process of configuring networks with CA certificates.
- The attacker does not need any special system permissions or privileges other than the ability to present a valid network the user may attempt to connect to.
- The attacker requires a user to choose an insecure Wi-Fi connection.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves disabling the "Save" button in the Wi-Fi settings when a CA certificate is chosen, and the domain field is empty. The "Save" button is enabled only after a user inputs something into the domain field.
- Test cases are provided to ensure this is working as expected.
