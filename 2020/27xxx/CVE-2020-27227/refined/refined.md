- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, specifically within the `shell.jsp` file of OpenClinic GA. The application executes user-supplied input as a command without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Command Injection (CWE-77)
  - Lack of input sanitization
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with NT SYSTEM privileges.
  - Potential for exfiltration of the database and user credentials.
  - Complete compromise of the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/openclinic/util/shell.jsp` with a `c` parameter containing a malicious command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Network access to the OpenClinic GA server.
  - Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
  - Requires the attacker to first obtain a valid `JSESSIONID` cookie by sending an initial request with a random `JSESSIONID` then using the new cookie value in a subsequent request to trigger the vulnerability.
