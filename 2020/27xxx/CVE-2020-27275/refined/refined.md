The provided content relates to CVE-2020-27275.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XLS and DPA files in Delta Industrial Automation DOPSoft. This lack of validation can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing XLS and DPA files.
* Specifically, the vulnerability can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer or before the start of a data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves user interaction, specifically the target user opening a malicious XLS or DPA file or visiting a malicious web page.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of these specially crafted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious XLS or DPA file.
*   The attacker must induce the victim to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page, making user interaction a prerequisite for successful exploitation.
