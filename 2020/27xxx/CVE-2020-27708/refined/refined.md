Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Origin Client instantiates Qt applications, specifically how Qt is configured to load plugins. This allows a local user to manipulate the locations from which Origin loads Qt plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted plugin loading: The Origin client does not properly restrict the locations from which it loads Qt plugins, enabling an attacker to introduce malicious plugins.
- Privilege escalation: A non-administrative user can exploit the plugin loading vulnerability to gain either Administrator or SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full system control: Once an attacker has elevated privileges to Administrator or System, they can take full control of the system, including performing actions reserved for high-privileged users and system administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the machine where the vulnerable Origin client is installed.
- File System Manipulation: The attacker needs to create a specifically named directory at a fixed location (`C:\`) and place a specially crafted Qt plugin in it.
- Service Manipulation: The attacker needs to stop and restart the Origin Client Service to elevate to SYSTEM privileges or, they need to induce an administrative user to run an Origin application with elevated privileges via the UAC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have a valid user account on the target machine.
- Ability to manipulate the file system: The attacker must be able to create directories and place files in specific locations on the hard drive.
- Technical Knowledge: The attacker needs to have knowledge about how Qt plugins work and create the specially crafted Qt plugin to execute their malicious code

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Origin client versions 10.5.86 and earlier for both Mac and PC.
- The fix restricts the dynamic loading of Origin Qt plugins to specific, predefined directories that are only editable by an Administrator account.
- The provided document also mentions that the "Restricted Access Mode" does not prevent this vulnerability as it does not restrict the locations used by third-party components.
- The vulnerability was reported by security researchers and was not known to be exploited against EA's customers at the time of the advisory.
- The advisory also mentions the CVSS score for the vulnerability as 7.8, indicating high severity.
