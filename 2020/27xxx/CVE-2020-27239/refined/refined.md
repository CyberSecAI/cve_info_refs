- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `assetStatus` parameter in the `getAssets.jsp` page is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL queries, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying data, or performing other malicious database operations.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `getAssets.jsp` page, specifically manipulating the `assetStatus` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
