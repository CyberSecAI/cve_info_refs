- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references in the `getNews` method.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information in the context of SYSTEM. The XML parser is forced to access a URI provided in a specially crafted XML document, embedding the content into the XML for further processing.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, the attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
