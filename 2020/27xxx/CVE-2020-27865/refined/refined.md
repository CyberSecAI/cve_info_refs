Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-27865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to incorrect string matching logic within the uhttpd service. Specifically, when the request contains `unauth.cgi` or `securityquestions.cgi`, authentication is bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: The primary weakness is that authentication is bypassed when certain strings are present in the request.
-  Incorrect String Matching Logic: The flawed logic in the uhttpd service is the root cause of the authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device in the context of the webserver.
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and gain control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-Adjacent Access: The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
- HTTP Requests: The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the device's uhttpd service running on port 80.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be network adjacent to the target device.
-  No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in D-Link DAP-1860 hardware revision Ax using firmware v1.04b03 and below.
- The vulnerability was reported by chung96vn of Vietnam Cyber Security Center working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- D-Link has released a hotfix (v1.04b06) to address this issue.
