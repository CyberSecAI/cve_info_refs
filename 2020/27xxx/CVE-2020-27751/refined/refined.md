Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-27751:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `MagickCore/quantum-export.c` file of ImageMagick. Specifically, it involves issues related to how the software handles the export of quantum values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates values that can exceed the maximum value of an `unsigned long long` data type.
*   **Excessive Shift Exponent:**  The code uses a shift exponent that is too large for a 64-bit type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:**  The above vulnerabilities lead to undefined behavior due to out-of-range values and excessive shift exponents.
*   **Application Availability:** The primary impact is likely to be a denial of service due to application instability and crashes. However, there's potential for other issues related to undefined behavior that could lead to other impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Image File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted image file to be processed by ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted image file to a system that uses ImageMagick for processing. This implies that the attacker could be external or internal, as long as they can get the malformed image processed by the vulnerable software.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick version 7.0.9-0
*   The issue was initially reported on github (<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1727>) and the upstream patch can be found here: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/f60d59cc3a7e3402d403361e0985ffa56f746a82>
*   The vulnerability affects Debian 9 and 10.
