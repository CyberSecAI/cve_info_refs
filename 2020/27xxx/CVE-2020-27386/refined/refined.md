Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload combined with insufficient file extension validation within the FlexDotnetCMS application. Specifically, the application blacklists certain file extensions during the upload process, but not during the file renaming process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows authenticated users to upload files of various types, including those with potentially malicious content.
*   **Insufficient File Extension Validation:** The application only checks the file extension during the upload process. It fails to perform proper validation of file extensions when a user renames the file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The rename function within the application permits users to change file extensions, bypassing the initial upload restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a file with a benign extension (e.g., .txt), rename it to an executable extension (e.g., .asp), and then execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the renamed file.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** The attack results in remote code execution with the same privileges as the user running the web server process, which often has elevated privileges in IIS environments.
*  **System Compromise**: By gaining remote code execution, the attacker can potentially access sensitive information, modify system configurations, or install additional malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability using HTTP requests to interact with the web application, specifically by uploading files, renaming them, and then accessing the renamed files.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the application's web interface, specifically using the File Manager and File Editor components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the FlexDotnetCMS application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable FlexDotnetCMS instance.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable application**: The attacker needs to be aware of the file upload functionality and the ability to rename files.

**More Detailed Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in FlexDotnetCMS versions 1.5.8 and prior.
* The vulnerability can be exploited through two methods: using the rename function in the FileManager (in v1.5.7 and prior) or using the FileEditor (in v1.5.8 and prior).
* The attacker uploads a file with a safe extension (.txt), then renames the file with an executable extension (.asp).
* After renaming, the attacker can execute the file via HTTP GET request to /<path_to_file>.
*  A Metasploit module was created to exploit this vulnerability.
