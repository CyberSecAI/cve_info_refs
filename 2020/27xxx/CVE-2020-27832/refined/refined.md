**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious scripts into the repository's email notification display.
- A user views the notification, triggering the execution of the injected script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into repository email notifications. This likely requires some level of access or privileges to modify repository settings or create notifications with malicious content.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick another user into viewing the malicious notifications.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in quay version 3.3.2.
- The fix involves input validation and sanitization.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as PROJQUAY-1344 and PROJQUAY-1377 in Red Hat's issue tracker.
