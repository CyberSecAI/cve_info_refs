Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Poppler, a PDF
rendering library, that could lead to denial of service or possibly other
unspecified impact when processing maliciously crafted documents.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.71.0-5+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

For the detailed security status of poppler please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/poppler>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-23 15:10:40 UTC  ``` In poppler-v0.75.0 in pdftohtml there is a buffer overflow.  Upstream issue: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/issues/742>  Upstream fix: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/commit/30c731b487190c02afff3f036736a392eb60cd9a>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c3)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-23 15:11:04 UTC  ``` Created poppler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1900713](show_bug.cgi?id=1900713 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-27778 poppler: buffer overflow in pdftohtml could result in a DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-03 09:29:45 UTC  ``` This flaw revolves around the usage of the FILE pointer 'page' declared as a member variable of the HtmlOutputDev class. Under some circumstances this pointer is never initialized between the point in time when a HtmlOutputDev object is created and the time the same object is deleted. When the object is deleted, the destructor could use the same uninitialized pointer leading to undefined behavior (most likely a crash of the application).  /* class declaration */ class HtmlOutputDev: public OutputDev { private:   FILE *page; };  /* destructor */ HtmlOutputDev::~HtmlOutputDev() {   if (page != nullptr) {     fputs("</body>\n</html>\n", page);   <= access to uninitialized pointer   } }   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-03 09:44:50 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c0): > Upstream fix: > <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/commit/30c731b487190c02afff3f036736a392eb60cd9a>  The patch initializes 'page' in the HtmlOutputDev constructor, effectively preventing the destructor from doing damage in case the pointer is never modified during the object's life cycle.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-03 14:09:49 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c6): > This flaw revolves around the usage of the FILE pointer 'page' declared as a > member variable of the HtmlOutputDev class.

When the object > is deleted, the destructor could use the same uninitialized pointer leading > to undefined behavior (most likely a crash of the application).  Code execution might be possible, depending on the ability of the attacker to control and shape the heap state when the HtmlOutputDev destructor is executed. However, it does seem quite difficult to achieve and RHEL mitigations like ASLR would prevent this flaw from being exploited in any meaningful way.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-05-18 15:49:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:1881 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1881](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1881)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1900712#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-18 20:37:13 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
