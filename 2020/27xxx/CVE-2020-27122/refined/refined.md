Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect privilege assignment within the Microsoft Active Directory integration of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). Specifically, a crafted Active Directory account can be used to gain higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266):** The system doesn't properly restrict access, allowing an authenticated user with a specifically crafted Active Directory account to escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to elevate their privileges from a valid administrator account to *root* privileges on the affected device.
*   **Integrity Impact (High):** The attacker gains unauthorized control of the system, potentially allowing them to modify system settings, install malicious software, or steal sensitive data.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
*   **Active Directory CLI Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered by logging into the system using a crafted Active Directory account via the CLI. Note that Active Directory CLI authentication is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by a user with *administrator* access for the exploitation to work.
*   **Crafted Active Directory Account**: The attacker needs to use an Active Directory account with a specific format that triggers the privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Administrator Account:** The attacker must already possess a valid *administrator* account on the Cisco ISE device.
*   **CLI access:** The attacker must be able to access the CLI and log in with the crafted Active Directory account.
*   **Active Directory CLI Capability Enabled:** An administrator must have enabled both the Active Directory CLI capability and Active Directory CLI authentication on the device for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects devices that have the CLI configured to support Active Directory authentication.
*   Other uses of Active Directory (Domain Services, Certificate Services) within ISE are not affected.
*   Cisco ISE releases 2.6 and 2.7 are vulnerable; the fix is available in patches 2.6 Patch 9 and later, 2.7 Patch 3 and later, and 3.0 and later.
*   There are no workarounds, but administrators can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the Active Directory CLI capability. However, an administrator can re-enable it.
