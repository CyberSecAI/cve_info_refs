- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the dynamic use of parameters in prepared SQL statements within the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page. Specifically, user-supplied input for the `immoService` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because the value of `immoService` is directly concatenated into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `listImmoLabels.jsp` page, where the `immoService` parameter is modified to contain malicious SQL code.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to exploit this vulnerability.
