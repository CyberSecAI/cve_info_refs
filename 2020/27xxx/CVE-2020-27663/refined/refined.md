Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-27663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) present in the `ajax/getDropdownValue.php` script within the GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application allows an attacker to directly manipulate the parameters of the `ajax/getDropdownValue.php` script to access data from various object types within GLPI, without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with a valid (even a self-service) account can read data (specifically id and name fields) from any item type in GLPI, such as Tickets, Users, and other sensitive entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct manipulation of request parameters**: Attacker can modify parameters in requests to `ajax/getDropdownValue.php` to access unauthorized data

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs a valid account on GLPI. Even a self-service profile is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found by @indevi0us.
- The fix was implemented in commit `e0d6a24d16f11505663928cc47292aec77ca2612` and included in GLPI version 9.5.3.
- The impact is described as moderate, because the attacker can only get id and name values of items, not all their attributes.
