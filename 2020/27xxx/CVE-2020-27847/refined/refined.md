Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-27847

**Description:**
This CVE is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability in the SAML connector of the `github.com/dexidp/dex` library. The vulnerability stems from issues in how the library processes SAML Signature Validation.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the way Go's `encoding/xml` library handles XML parsing and serialization, specifically related to:
  - Element namespace prefix instability
  - Attribute namespace prefix instability
  - Directive comment instability
  These instabilities allow for malicious XML manipulation during round-trips (decode and encode cycles) which can be exploited in SAML authentication processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SAML Signature Validation Bypass:** Attackers can inject malicious XML markup into a signed SAML message. The altered message still appears correctly signed due to the round-trip instability in XML parsing, but the semantics of the message can be changed.
- **XML Round-Trip Instability:** The `encoding/xml` library doesn't preserve the semantic integrity of XML during decode/encode cycles. This means that if an application parses XML, then re-serializes it, and parses it again, the final parsed result may not match the original input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating SAML messages, attackers can potentially bypass authentication mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to systems and resources.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could impersonate other users, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or access to sensitive data.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and System Availability:** The vulnerability can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system due to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential system disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SAML Message Manipulation:** An attacker crafts malicious XML within a SAML message.
- **XML Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious XML into a SAML message. This is usually done before the signature, so the signature is on a message that has the malicious code within.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the SAML message before the server processes it.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to exploit the XML parsing instability in the SAML authentication flow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `github.com/dexidp/dex` library versions <= 2.26.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in dex version 2.27.0.
- The issue stems from a weakness within Go's `encoding/xml` library, specifically its handling of XML namespaces and comments.
- Mattermost was also affected by this vulnerability, but has released a patch to address it.
- The Go security team is planning to introduce changes to `encoding/xml` that deprecate existing behaviors from a security perspective and introduce a new API. This new API will allow disabling namespace prefix parsing entirely.
- A workaround/fix is available via the `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` library.
