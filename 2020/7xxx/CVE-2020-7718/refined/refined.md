  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `deepSet` and `deepMerge` functions in the `gammautils` library are vulnerable to prototype pollution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Unsafe Object recursive merge",
      "Property definition by path"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can manipulate the `__proto__` attribute to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, which can lead to denial of service (DoS), remote code execution (RCE), or property injection.",

      "Manipulating the `__proto__` attribute in the input to vulnerable functions.",
      "Using malicious payloads in the `deepSet` and `deepMerge` functions."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the input to the vulnerable functions, specifically the properties used in the `deepSet` or `deepMerge` functions. No special privileges or user interaction is needed."
