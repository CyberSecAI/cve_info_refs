Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `mosc` package utilizes the `eval` function to process user-provided input within the `properties` argument in the `parse_properties` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use of `eval` on user-controlled input allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can gain access to all resources on the impacted component.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify data, although the extent of control over the modification's consequence and its impact on the impacted component is limited.
*   **Reduced Availability:** There may be interruptions in resource availability, although the attacker's ability to completely deny service is limited.
*   **High Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.6.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is network-bound, making it remotely exploitable across the Internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need prior access or authorization.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack can be executed without any user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious string to the properties argument.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Package:** `mosc`
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `parse_properties`
*   **Vulnerable Argument:** `properties`
*   **PoC:** Provided example code demonstrates how to inject and execute code.
*   **No Fix:** There isn't a fixed version of the `mosc` package.
*   **Snyk ID:** SNYK-JS-MOSC-571492
*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7672
*   **CWE ID:** CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command)
