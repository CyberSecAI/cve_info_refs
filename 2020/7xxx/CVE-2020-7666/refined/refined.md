Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a "Zip Slip" vulnerability affecting the `github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio` package. This vulnerability stems from improper handling of file paths within CPIO archives during extraction. Specifically, the code does not adequately sanitize paths containing `..` sequences, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By crafting a CPIO archive with filenames containing `../` sequences, an attacker can cause files to be written to arbitrary locations outside the intended extraction directory. This includes:
    *   Leading and non-leading relative path traversal using `../`
    *   Symlink-based path traversal using relative and absolute symlinks

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to any location where the user running the extraction has write access.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Overwriting critical files such as executables or configuration files can lead to arbitrary code execution. For example, the provided content describes overwriting the `authorized_keys` file in the `.ssh` directory with malicious content, which can then grant attackers unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted CPIO Archive:** The attack vector is a specially crafted CPIO archive. This archive includes file entries with paths containing `../` sequences, or symlinks pointing outside the intended directory.
*   **Archive Extraction:**  The vulnerability is triggered during the extraction of a maliciously crafted archive using the vulnerable package's file extraction functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious Archive:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable software with a malicious CPIO archive.
*   **Write Permissions on Target System:** The attacker needs write access to the filesystem locations they are trying to target.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying how filepaths are joined. Instead of using `filepath.Join(base, file)`, the fix uses `filepath.Join(base, filepath.Join("/", file))`. Joining to "/" effectively normalizes the path, removing `..` sequences.
*  The fix was initially implemented in pull request #1817, and later properly addressed in pull request #2344.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of `github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio` prior to 0.9.0.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with leading, non-leading `../` sequences, and relative/absolute symlinks.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) was provided, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability using a CPIO archive with malicious filepaths.
*   Snyk assigned a severity score of 7.5 (High) for this vulnerability.
