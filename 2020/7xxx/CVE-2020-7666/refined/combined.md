The fix is simple: given a base path and file path, instead of

filepath.Join(base, file)

do

filepath.Join(base, filepath.Join("/", file))

## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio` to version 0.9.0 or higher.

## Overview

[github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio](http://github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio) is a package that provides Go versions of standard Linux tools and bootloaders. It also provides tools for compiling Go programs in a single binary and creating initramfs images.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). It is vulnerable to leading, non-leading relative path traversal attacks and symlink based (relative and absolute) path traversal attacks in cpio file extraction.

### PoC

// poc.go:

```
package main

import (
    "io"
    "log"
    "os"
    "github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/cpio"
)

func main() {
    archiver, err := cpio.Format("newc")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Format -H newc not supported: %v", err)
    }

```
var inums map[uint64]string
inums = make(map[uint64]string)

rr := archiver.Reader(os.Stdin)
for {
    rec, err := rr.ReadRecord()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf(&quot;error reading records: %v&quot;, err)
    }

    if rec.Info.FileSize == 0 {
        if _, ok := inums[rec.Info.Ino]; ok {
            err := os.Link(inums[rec.Info.Ino], rec.Name)
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
            }
            continue
        }
    }
    inums[rec.Info.Ino] = rec.Name
    if err := cpio.CreateFile(rec); err != nil {
        log.Printf(&quot;Creating %q failed: %v&quot;, rec.Name, err)
    }
}

```

}

```

* Build the executable `go build poc.go`
* Run `./poc < archive.cpio`
  with "archive.cpio" being a cpio archive that includes at least one of the following:

1. file with filepath that uses leading or non-leading "../"
2. file symlink that point outside of the current directory (relative or absolute)
3. directory symlink that point outside of the current directory (relative or absolute) followed by a file under that directory
## Details

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you‚Äôve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within¬†[Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we‚Äôll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found¬†[here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at¬†report@snyk.io.
