Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the `angular` JavaScript library handles HTML input. Specifically, the regex-based input HTML replacement can lead to sanitized code becoming unsanitized. Wrapping `<option>` elements within `<select>` tags changes parsing behavior which can result in unsanitized code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, stemming from the improper sanitization of HTML input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The `angular` library does not correctly handle HTML input, particularly when `<option>` elements are nested within `<select>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal cookies and hijack user sessions.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive information can be exposed.
*  **Access to Privileged Services:** Attackers might gain unauthorized access to privileged services and functionalities.
*   **Malware Delivery:** XSS can be used as a vector for delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker delivers a malicious link externally to a user, which when clicked, executes malicious code reflected back by the vulnerable website.
*  **Mutated XSS:** The attacker injects seemingly safe code that the browser modifies while parsing, leading to the execution of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request, typically via a link, that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires basic user privileges to affect settings or files owned by a user.
*   **User Interaction:** While some forms of XSS may require user interaction (like clicking a malicious link), this vulnerability is rated as "None" for User Interaction.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** The `angular` npm package.
*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `angular` prior to 1.8.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade `angular` to version 1.8.0 or higher.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.0 (Medium) according to Snyk, 5.4 (Medium) according to NVD and Red Hat.
*   **CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Krzysztof Kotowicz.
