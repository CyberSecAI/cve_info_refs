Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop within the `xmlStringLenDecodeEntities` function in `parser.c` of the `libxml2` library. This infinite loop occurs specifically in certain end-of-file (EOF) situations when decoding XML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'):** The core weakness is an infinite loop within a function that decodes XML entities under specific EOF conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop can cause a denial-of-service condition, potentially rendering the application or system unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption. The program will not terminate normally, hogging CPU time.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network. An attacker could craft a malicious XML file and send it to a vulnerable system.
*   **XML File Parsing:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML file that triggers the infinite loop when processed by `libxml2`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication, which makes it easier to exploit.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered low, meaning it does not require specialized skills or resources for successful exploitation.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to `libxml2` version 2.9.10 and is fixed in later versions.
*   The infinite loop is triggered when the parser encounters an end-of-file (EOF) situation. Specifically when  `ctxt->instate == XML_PARSER_EOF`, `xmlParseStringEntityRef` returns `NULL`, causing an infinite loop in `xmlStringLenDecodeEntities`.
*   The issue is located in `parser.c` within the `libxml2` library.
*   The vulnerability was found using fuzzing techniques with libFuzzer, suggesting that it is difficult to trigger manually.
