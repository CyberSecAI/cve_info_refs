Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure access controls to the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Specifically, factory testing APIs exposed by Trusted Applications (TAs) running in the TEE could be directly accessed from the Rich Execution Environment (REE) after gaining root privileges.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-215:**  "Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Debugging Code" - This likely refers to the factory testing APIs which, though intended for debugging/testing, contained functionality that should not be accessible in production.
    *   **CWE-489:** "Leftover Debug Code" -  This likely refers to the presence of the factory test API in the production build.
    *  Insecure access controls between the REE and TEE which allow unauthorized access to biometric data
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with root privileges on the device can retrieve bitmap images of fingerprint data directly from the fingerprint sensor. This could lead to the exposure and misuse of users' biometric data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is achieving root access on the affected OnePlus 7 Pro device.
    *   After gaining root, the attacker communicates with the TEE through exposed factory testing APIs to extract raw fingerprint data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have root privileges on the Android device. This requires either a system exploit or physical access to the device with the ability to enable root privileges (e.g. through developer options or exploiting a vulnerability in the REE).
    *  The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific API calls needed to retrieve the fingerprint data from the TEE via the exposed factory test API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at the Black Duck Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC).
*   The vulnerability affects OnePlus 7 Pro devices with software builds prior to 10.0.3.GM21BA released on Jan. 7, 2020.
*   OnePlus has released a patch (10.0.3.GM21BA) to address this issue.
