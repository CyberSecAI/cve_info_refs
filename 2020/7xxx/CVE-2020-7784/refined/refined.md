Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `ts-process-promises` package, specifically in the `lib/process-promises.js` file at line 45.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The package is vulnerable to command injection due to unsanitized input passed to a function that executes shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used.
- This can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality, allowing the attacker to access all resources.
- There's a potential for data modification, though the attacker's control over the extent of changes may be limited.
- Resource availability can be reduced or interrupted, but not to a point where the service is entirely denied.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via the network, meaning an attacker can be located remotely.
- The attack does not require specialized access conditions, making it relatively easy to exploit.
- No privileges or user interaction are required for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require prior authorization or access to the vulnerable system. They only need to be able to execute code utilizing the `ts-process-promises` package.
- The attacker can be located anywhere on the network, including the internet.
- The attacker does not need any user interaction to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- There is a proof of concept (PoC) available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).
- The vulnerable package is `ts-process-promises`.
- There is no fixed version available.
- The Snyk CVSS score is 8.6 (High) while NVD scored it as 9.8 (Critical).
