  "CVE-2020-7066": {
    "Description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.29, 7.3.x below 7.3.16 and 7.4.x below 7.4.4, while using get_headers() with user-supplied URL, if the URL contains zero (\\0) character, the URL will be silently truncated at it. This may cause some software to make incorrect assumptions about the target of the get_headers() and possibly send some information to a wrong server.",
    "Root cause": "The get_headers() function in PHP does not properly handle URLs containing null bytes, leading to silent truncation of the URL at the null byte.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "URL Parsing Vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure, as a truncated URL may lead to sending requests to an unintended server, potentially leaking sensitive data or credentials to an attacker-controlled server.",
     "Attack vectors": [
          "Network",
          "Crafted URL"
        ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a user-controlled URL containing a null byte to the vulnerable get_headers() function.",
  "Additional Details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the target of a get_headers() request by embedding a null character in the URL, causing the function to ignore the part of the URL after the null byte.  This can lead to sending requests to unintended or attacker-controlled servers."
