Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The WordPress Database Reset plugin lacked proper security checks when resetting the `wp_users` database table. Specifically, it did not have sufficient authorization controls, allowing low-privileged users to trigger the reset function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Any authenticated user, even with minimal privileges like a subscriber, could reset the `wp_users` table. This reset would drop all existing users, except the user making the request, and elevate the requesting user's privileges to administrator.
*   **Insecure User Settings Update:**  The `update_user_settings` function would update the password and clear the activation key of the user, and if the users table is reset, it would update it for the requesting user and would log them in if `reset_users` is true.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Site Takeover:** An attacker could create a low-privileged account (e.g., a subscriber) on a WordPress site, use this account to reset the user table, and become the sole administrator. This grants the attacker full control of the website, allowing them to modify content, install malicious plugins, and access sensitive data.
*   **Loss of Access:** All legitimate administrators and users would be removed from the site, causing a complete loss of access.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker would have the ability to modify any data on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker would send a crafted HTTP request to trigger the database reset function.
*   **Authentication Required (Low Privileges):** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, but it can be any low-privileged account, such as a subscriber.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the WordPress site:** The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress site.
*   **Registered user on the vulnerable site:** The attacker needs an account on the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions 3.1 and earlier of the WP Database Reset plugin.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.15, which included a security nonce check and a capability check, requiring the user to have administrator privileges.
*  The `update_user_settings` function does not have a capability check.
