Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `docker-compose-remote-api` package's `exec` function in `index.js` uses the `serviceName` variable, which is user-controlled, without any sanitization. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system by manipulating the `serviceName` variable passed to the `exec` function. This occurs because the input is not sanitized or validated before being used in the execution of system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the `docker-compose-remote-api` application.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**
    *   **High Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Low Integrity Impact:**  An attacker can modify data, but the attacker doesn't have complete control.
    *   **None Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not impact the availability of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious code through the `serviceName` parameter when calling the `exec` function. For instance, the proof of concept shows injecting `& touch vulnerable.txt`
*   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the `serviceName` parameter passed to the vulnerable function. This is typically achieved by making a call to the `exec` function with a malicious string as the `serviceName`.
*   No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
