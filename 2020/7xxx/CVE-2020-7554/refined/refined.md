Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data length during the parsing of CGF files within Schneider Electric IGSS. Specifically, the software fails to validate the length of the data before copying it into a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The lack of proper length validation allows an attacker to write data beyond the boundaries of the allocated stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious CGF Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious CGF file containing oversized data designed to trigger the overflow.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could embed the malicious CGF file on a web page or trick a user into opening the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the victim to either open a malicious CGF file or visit a malicious web page containing the exploit.
*   **No prior authentication/privileges required**: The advisory indicates no required privileges or authentication to trigger the vulnerability, suggesting a low barrier of entry for attackers.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor has released an update to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-08-07.
*   The advisory was publicly released on 2021-01-29.
*   The vulnerability is present in Schneider Electric IGSS software.
*   CVSS Score is 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
