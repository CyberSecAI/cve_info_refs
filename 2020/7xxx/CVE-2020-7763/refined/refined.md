Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on file access when processing HTML content, allowing an attacker to potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The `phantom-html-to-pdf` package, prior to version 0.6.1, allows reading local files through the `file:///` protocol or by not restricting access to local files. This occurs because the `allowLocalFilesAccess` is not properly configured or defaulted to false, allowing the conversion to access and read files outside of the intended scope.
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability can potentially be exploited via directory traversal if the injected HTML contains path traversal characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored on the server's file system, such as configuration files, source code, or other confidential data. The impact is rated as "High" for Confidentiality.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Exposure of credentials or configurations could be a stepping stone to broader attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious HTML into the conversion process. This HTML may include JavaScript that uses `window.location` or similar techniques to specify a local file path using the `file:///` protocol.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable service that is using the `phantom-html-to-pdf` package.
- **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the HTML content that is processed by the vulnerable service.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC code demonstrates how to inject JavaScript that reads a file using the `file:///` protocol.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.6.1 and later by properly checking for local file access and denying access by default. The fix also involves changing how file URLs are handled. Specifically, instead of naively replacing `file://` with `http://`, the code now explicitly checks for `file:///` and aborts the request unless `allowLocalFilesAccess` is set to true.
- **CWE-22:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-22, which represents improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.

In summary, this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files from the server through HTML injection by exploiting the way `phantom-html-to-pdf` handles local file access. The fix involves restricting local file access by default and implementing checks for the `file:///` protocol.
