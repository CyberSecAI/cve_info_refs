Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `goliath` library's incorrect parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers in HTTP requests. This improper parsing allows for HTTP request smuggling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Header Parsing:** The `goliath` library does not correctly handle `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, leading to ambiguity in how requests are processed.
- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** Due to the parsing issues, an attacker can craft malicious requests that are interpreted differently by `goliath` and intermediary servers or other backend systems in a chain, leading to request smuggling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality:** The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information by manipulating how requests are routed and processed.
- **Integrity:** While the provided information states no loss of integrity within the impacted component itself, the ability to smuggle requests can indirectly impact the integrity of other systems in the chain by manipulating their states/data.
- **Availability:** No direct impact on the availability of the `goliath` service is indicated in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access to the vulnerable system.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by crafting specific HTTP requests with manipulated `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `goliath` server or any server in the chain where `goliath` is part of the backend.
- **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Request Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests with malicious `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `goliath` package (>=0.0.0).
- There is no fixed version available for `goliath`.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The exploit is considered "remotely exploitable" and can occur at the protocol level.
- The attack complexity is considered high, indicating that successful exploitation might require some effort by the attacker.
