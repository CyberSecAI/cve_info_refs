## FreeBSD Kernel NAT Out-Of-Bounds Access Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-659ZDI-CAN-10624

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-7454](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7454) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.8, [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | FreeBSD |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Kernel |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FreeBSD Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the implementation of NAT. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | FreeBSD has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-03-15 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2020-05-19 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-20:12.libalias Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Insufficient packet length validation in libalias
Category: core
Module: libalias
Announced: 2020-05-12
Credits: Lucas Leong (@\_wmliang\_) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
Vishnu working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2020-05-12 16:49:04 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
2020-05-12 16:51:11 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p5)
2020-05-12 16:49:04 UTC (stable/11, 11.4-STABLE)
2020-05-12 16:51:11 UTC (releng/11.4, 11.4-BETA1-p1)
2020-05-12 16:51:11 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p9)
CVE Name: CVE-2020-7454
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The ipfw(4) system facility allows IP packet filtering, redirecting, and
traffic accounting. The ipfw(4) packet filter also contains two different
methods of accomplishing network address translation (NAT): in-kernel and
userspace. Both implementations use the same functions provided by libalias.
The libalias(3) library is a collection of functions for aliasing and
dealiasing of IP packets, intended for masquerading and NAT. Additionally,
libalias(3) includes modules to support protocols that require additional
logic to support address translation.
Note: libalias(3) is not used by either the pf(4) or ipf(4) firewalls.
II. Problem Description
libalias(3) packet handlers do not properly validate the packet length before
accessing the protocol headers. As a result, if a libalias(3) module does
not properly validate the packet length before accessing the protocol header,
it is possible for an out of bound read or write condition to occur.
III. Impact
A malicious attacker could send specially constructed packets that exploit
the lack of validation allowing the attacker to read or write memory either
from the kernel (for the in-kernel NAT implementation) or from the process
space for natd (for the userspace implementation).
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. Only systems using NAT and ipfw together are
affected. Systems using ipfw(4) without NAT, or systems leveraging pf(4) or
ipf(4) are not affected.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:12/libalias.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:12/libalias.patch.asc
# gpg --verify libalias.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/12/ r360971
releng/12.1/ r360972
stable/11/ r360971
releng/11.4/ r360972
releng/11.3/ r360972
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:
