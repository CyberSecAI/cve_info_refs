Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7957:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the snippet generation process of Dovecot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation leading to a crash.
- Specifically, a crash occurs during snippet generation if a message meets these conditions:
  - The message is large enough that the message parser returns multiple body blocks.
  - The first block(s) do not contain the full snippet (e.g., they are full of whitespace).
  - The input ends with a '>'.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending specially crafted emails can cause a crash during snippet generation.
- **Mail Inaccessibility:** This crash can lead to permanently inaccessible mail in the mailbox or cause mail to get stuck in the delivery process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted email to the affected Dovecot server via LMTP or IMAP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send email to the affected Dovecot server. They do not need any special authentication, as the issue is triggered during message processing.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Dovecot versions 2.3.9 and is fixed in version 2.3.9.3
- The vulnerable components are `lmtp` and `imap`.
- The CVSS score is 3.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L), indicating a low impact on availability.
