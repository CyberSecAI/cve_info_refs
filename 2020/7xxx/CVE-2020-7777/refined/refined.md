Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `jsen` npm package, specifically in how it handles the `required` field of a JSON schema. The content of the `required` field is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The unsanitized content from the `required` field is used to construct a string that is then passed to `Function.apply()`. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the absence of proper sanitization of the `required` field within the JSON schema. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker who can control the JSON schema file can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- This can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify files, or disrupt the system completely.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves an attacker controlling the JSON schema file used by the `jsen` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Schema Control:** The attacker needs the ability to influence or provide the JSON schema that is being processed by the `jsen` library. This could be achieved through various means depending on how the `jsen` library is used in an application (e.g., a user uploading a malicious JSON schema, an attacker compromising the source of the schema, etc.).
- **No User Interaction Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction once the malicious schema is processed.

**Additional Notes:**
- There is no fixed version for the vulnerable package `jsen`.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept of the exploit.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Code Injection).
- The exploit maturity is high, indicating that a proof-of-concept is available.
- The CVSS score is 7.2 (high).
