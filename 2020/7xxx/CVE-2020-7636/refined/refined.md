Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7636:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `adb-driver` package is vulnerable to command injection because the `command` argument passed to the `execADBCommand` function is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-74):** The package allows user-controlled input to be passed directly into a system command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `command` argument is directly used in a call to execute an ADB command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality (High):** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information by injecting commands that expose data.
*   **Integrity (Low):** An attacker can modify data by injecting commands, although the extent of modification may be limited.
*   **Availability (None):**  The vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the application. However, an attacker could potentially use the vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malicious string to the `execADBCommand` function, using the package as intended.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `command` parameter that is passed to the `execADBCommand` function. This can be done remotely if the application is set up to receive this input from an external source.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `build/AdbDriver.js`, specifically around line 26.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection by executing the command `touch Song` via `root.execADBCommand(' & touch Song')`.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as a medium severity issue by Snyk, with a CVSS score of 6.5. However, the NVD rates the vulnerability as critical with a score of 9.8.
*   The exploit maturity is classified as "proof-of-concept".

**Additional Notes**
* There is no fix available for this vulnerability.
