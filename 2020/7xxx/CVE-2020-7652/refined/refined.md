Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7652

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient path validation in the `snyk-broker` package, allowing for arbitrary file reads. By renaming files to match whitelisted paths, users with access to Snyk's internal network could bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The core vulnerability is the ability to read any file on the system where the broker is running, by manipulating the file paths.
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is rooted in a path traversal issue, where the broker does not properly sanitize or validate the file paths, allowing access to files outside the intended directories.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The vulnerability highlights insufficient access controls as internal network users were able to leverage this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the system where the `snyk-broker` is running. This could lead to the disclosure of configuration files, credentials, source code, or other sensitive data. The impact is rated as a "High" risk to confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is network-based, meaning that the attacker exploits the issue remotely over the network.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must manipulate file paths (renaming files) to match whitelisted paths and then access them through the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Internal Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the Snyk's internal network.
*   **Privileges Required (High):** The attacker requires significant control over the vulnerable component, allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `snyk-broker` versions prior to 4.80.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Wing Chan of The Hut Group.
*   Snyk has released version 4.80.0 of the Broker to patch this vulnerability.
*   Snyk also took steps to improve auditability of the broker code and improve logging.
