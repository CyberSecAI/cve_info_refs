Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7040:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `storeBackup` application using a fixed default lock file path at `/tmp/storeBackup.lock`. This location is world-writable, allowing any local user to manipulate the lock file, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) and a race condition exploitable for symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged user can create a file at `/tmp/storeBackup.lock`, causing `storeBackup` to believe another instance is running and prevent it from executing.
2.  **Symlink Attack:** Due to a race condition, an attacker can create a symlink at `/tmp/storeBackup.lock` just before `storeBackup` attempts to create the lock file, potentially leading to arbitrary file creation or overwriting when `storeBackup` writes to the symlink target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DoS:**  System backups using `storeBackup` can be prevented, impacting data integrity and recovery capabilities.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Creation:** A local attacker can gain the ability to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user running `storeBackup`, usually root, which could lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack is limited to local users on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the system where `storeBackup` is running.
*   The attacker must be able to write to the `/tmp` directory.
*   For the symlink attack, the attacker needs to win a race condition.

**Technical Details:**

*   `storeBackup` first uses `stat()` and `lstat()` on the lock file then proceeds to open the file for creation, which creates the race condition.
*   The vulnerability is present because the lock file is created in `/tmp`, a world writable directory.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary fix is to modify the default lockfile path, ideally placing it in a location only accessible to root, such as `/var/lock/storeBackup.lock`. Alternatively, user-specific paths such as `/run/user/$UID/storeBackup.lock` can also be used.
*   Using `sysopen()` with the `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` flags can fix the race condition and the symlink attack vector, since it ensures the file is created atomically and avoids following symlinks.

**Additional Information**

*   The bug was initially found during a code review by openSUSE.
*   The upstream maintainer was slow to respond, requiring distributions to create their own patches.
*   A patch was created by Jan Ritzerfeld for openSUSE which uses `sysopen()` to fix the symlink attack.
*   Ubuntu and Debian also issued updates to address this issue.
