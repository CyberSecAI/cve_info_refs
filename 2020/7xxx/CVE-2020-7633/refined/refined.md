Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `apiconnect-cli-plugins` package. The `pluginUri` argument, which is part of the `installPlugin` function, is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-74):** The application executes commands based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** There is a total loss of confidentiality, meaning all resources within the impacted component can be divulged to the attacker.
- **Integrity:** Data modification is possible, though the extent and direct impact may be limited.
- **Availability:** While not directly mentioned, arbitrary command execution can easily lead to denial of service. The CVSS score does reflect no impact to availability, which is likely inaccurate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network. The vulnerable component is exposed to the network, potentially extending to the entire Internet.
- The vulnerability does not require user interaction to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious `pluginUri` argument to the vulnerable function.
- The attacker can be remote, even from the internet.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is `installPlugin(pluginUri, registryUri)` in the `lib/plugin-loader.js` file (line 181).
- The `pluginUri` argument is directly used in a command without any sanitization.
- The provided proof of concept uses the payload `& touch Song &` to demonstrate command injection by creating a file named Song.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-7633.
- The affected package is `apiconnect-cli-plugins`, versions 1.0.1 and greater.
- There is no fix available for this vulnerability.
- Snyk rates the severity as medium with a CVSS score of 6.5.
- The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) rates the severity as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8.
