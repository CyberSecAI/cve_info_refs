  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A field disclosure flaw exists in Elasticsearch when running a scrolling search with Field Level Security.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "The vulnerability allows a user to potentially access fields that should be hidden by using a scrolling search with Field Level Security after another, more privileged user has run a similar query. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted scroll search request"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires a low-privileged account and the ability to submit search queries on the affected system. The attacker needs to run the same query as a more privileged user to exploit the vulnerability."
