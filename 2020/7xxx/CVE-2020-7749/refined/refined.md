Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `osm-static-maps` package directly passing user-supplied input to a template without proper escaping. The template uses `{{{ ... }}}` which allows for raw HTML/JS insertion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Because the template is rendered on the server-side, an attacker can manipulate the input to cause the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The unescaped user input can be used to inject malicious JavaScript into the HTML output if rendered on the client side, leading to potential XSS attacks.
*  **Local File Read:** The SSRF vulnerability can be exploited to read local files on the server by crafting a specific request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially scan internal networks, access internal services, and perform actions as the server.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts in a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Local File Read:** Sensitive local server files can be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The `tileserverUrl` parameter within the `osm-static-maps` package is the primary attack vector. This parameter directly passes user-controlled input to the vulnerable template.
*   Attackers can manipulate this URL parameter by crafting payloads including malicious Javascript and HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input supplied to the `tileserverUrl` parameter of the vulnerable `osm-static-maps` package.
*   This could be achieved through direct manipulation of URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) for both XSS and SSRF.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade to version 3.9.0 or higher of the `osm-static-maps` package, where input sanitization has been implemented.
*   The Snyk vulnerability report also provides CVSS scores, attack vector details and potential mitigations.
