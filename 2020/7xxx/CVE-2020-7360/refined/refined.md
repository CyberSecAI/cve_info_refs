Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-7360:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" vulnerability in the Philips SmartControl software. The software attempts to load several DLL files (`atiddc.dll`, `atiadlxx.dll`, `atiadlxy.dll`, and `MtxApi.dll`) without specifying their full paths and relies on the PATH environment variable. These DLL files are not present on Windows 10 systems by default and the application does not verify their presence/validity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The application is vulnerable to DLL hijacking because it searches for DLL files in user-writable locations specified in the PATH environment variable.
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Elements:** The application relies on the PATH environment variable, which can be modified by users and may include directories where low-privileged users can write files, leading to a privilege escalation opportunity when the application runs with elevated privileges.
- **Lack of proper path specification:** The application does not specify full paths to the required DLL files, nor does it use manifests to specify the libraries it needs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by placing a malicious DLL file with the same name as one of the missing DLL files in a directory within the PATH environment variable. When SmartControl is executed, it loads the malicious DLL, inheriting the elevated privileges of the SmartControl process.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker's malicious DLL can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, allowing them to take complete control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have write access to a directory listed in the system's PATH environment variable.
- The attacker must place a malicious DLL in this directory with the same name as one of the DLL files that SmartControl attempts to load.
- User interaction is needed. A user with elevated privileges needs to execute SmartControl in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a foothold on the target system to write files to a directory in the PATH environment variable, indicating they need to be at least a low-privileged user on the target machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious DLL.
- The attacker needs to be able to run a listener to catch the connection from the reverse shell in the DLL.
- User interaction from a user with elevated privileges is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in SmartControl versions released before April 15, 2020 (specifically before version 1.0.7).
- The patch involves the application no longer requiring administrator privileges to run. The updated version still tries to load several DLL files that are not present by default. However, because it runs with limited privileges, this issue can no longer be exploited for privilege escalation.
- The attacker can use Metasploit (msfvenom and msfconsole) to create a malicious DLL file and start a listener for the reverse shell.
