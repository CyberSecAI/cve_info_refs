Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of the `Transfer-Encoding` header in the `netius` Python library. This improper parsing allows for HTTP request smuggling attacks, specifically CL:TE or TE:TE attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper `Transfer-Encoding` header parsing.
- Susceptibility to HTTP request smuggling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Web-cache poisoning:** An attacker can manipulate the HTTP response, causing a web cache to store a malicious response for legitimate requests.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the response, leading to XSS attacks when the poisoned response is delivered to users.
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** Attackers might gain access to sensitive information from requests other than their own.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable `netius` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running an application that is using a vulnerable version of the `netius` library.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker does not require any privileges on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in `netius` versions prior to 1.17.58.
- Snyk assigned the ID **SNYK-PYTHON-NETIUS-569141** to this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3.1 score from Snyk is 8.2 (High).
- The vulnerability was first added to Snyk's vulnerability database on 19 May 2020.
