Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7984 (Although the provided text doesn't explicitly mention this CVE ID, the vulnerability described aligns with publicly available information about CVE-2020-7984 which involves SolarWinds MSP's n-Central RMM tool.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability, dubbed "Dumpster Diver," is a zero-day flaw within SolarWinds n-Central RMM tool, a remote monitoring and management platform for MSPs.
- The exploit allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive administrative credentials stored within the product's Agent and Probe settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure storage or handling of administrative credentials within the n-Central product.
- Lack of proper access controls or encryption mechanisms that enable unauthorized retrieval of stored passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** An attacker can steal domain administrator passwords and other sensitive credentials.
- **System Compromise:** With stolen domain admin credentials, attackers could:
    - Lock MSPs out of their systems.
    - Gain access to all systems and data managed through the n-Central platform, which often includes customer information.
    - Deploy malware, including ransomware.
- **Broad Impact:** The vulnerability affects MSPs using SolarWinds n-Central, potentially impacting all of their clients.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the SolarWinds n-Central RMM tool itself.
- Exploitation is achieved through a series of steps that were initially outlined in a Packet Storm article, indicating the attack methodology was somewhat complex but not beyond the ability of multiple parties to reproduce.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs a method of accessing the SolarWinds n-Central system.
- They must have the technical knowledge and skill to execute the exploit, which was available as a proof-of-concept.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was initially reported to SolarWinds in October, but the company did not prioritize it until a public proof of concept became available in January.
- **Initial Response:** SolarWinds initially claimed there was no proof of concept until one was publicly disclosed.
- **Hotfix:** SolarWinds has issued a hotfix to address the issue.
- **Mitigation Tool:** SolarWinds released a tool to expunge credentials in cases where the hotfix cannot be applied immediately.
- **Public Disclosure:** Although the initial disclosure and exploit details were taken down, it was too late as multiple parties had already accessed and shared them within the security community.
- **Real-World Impact:** The content included a quote from an MSP partner stating that an attacker could lock them out of their system and "steal whatever they want".
- **Comparison:** This incident is similar to other recent attacks where RMM tools have been exploited, like the ConnectWise Control incident.
