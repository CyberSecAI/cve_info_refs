  "CVE-2020-7206": {
    "Description": "HP nagios plugin for iLO (nagios-plugins-hpilo v1.50 and earlier) has a php code injection vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the `exec` function in the `nagios_hpeilo_service_details.php` file. Specifically, the `ip`, `comm`, and `id` parameters obtained via `$_GET` are used to construct a command string without sufficient escaping or sanitization before being executed by `exec`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Code injection vulnerability via the `exec` function.",
      "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input.",
      "Use of user-controlled data in command execution."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed on the server, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system. This could include, but not be limited to, data theft, service disruption, and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information. The severity is marked as High.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `nagios_hpeilo_service_details.php` file.",
        "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters (`ip`, `comm`, `id`) containing the code they want to inject."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `nagios_hpeilo_service_details.php` file.",
      "No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability as it is available through a public URL."
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The provided patch commit shows that the `escapeshellcmd` function was added to sanitize the command string before it is passed to `exec`. This mitigates the vulnerability by preventing attackers from injecting malicious commands."
