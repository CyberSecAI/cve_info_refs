  "CVE-2020-7693": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw in the sockjs-node library. It occurs due to incorrect handling of WebSocket upgrade requests, leading to a crash of the application or container using the library.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is improper handling of websocket upgrade requests. Specifically, the vulnerable versions of `sockjs-node` use `res.end()` instead of `res.write()` when handling upgrade requests. When a websocket upgrade request is received on an invalid URL, the application attempts to call `res.end()` multiple times leading to an `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` error that crashes the application or container.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS) due to improper handling of websocket upgrade requests.",
          "Calling res.end() multiple times on the response object leading to a crash"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack results in denial of service, causing the affected application or container to crash and become unavailable to legitimate users. This can lead to downtime and service interruption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the application's handling of HTTP requests with the `Upgrade: websocket` header.",
          "Sending a crafted HTTP request with the `Upgrade: websocket` header to a non-existent or incorrect URL path managed by `sockjs`."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or user interaction is required.",
        "attacker_position": "The attacker can be located anywhere on the network where the application is accessible, including the internet."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "sockjs-node library versions prior to 0.3.20",
      "Meteor JS versions prior to 1.10.2 (which use vulnerable versions of SockJS)"
    ],
    "remediation": "Upgrade the `sockjs` library to version 0.3.20 or higher. For MeteorJS users, upgrade to version 1.10.2 or higher.",
        "poc": "A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available, demonstrating how to send crafted HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability. The PoC uses Python `requests` library and sends requests with `Upgrade: websocket` header to various invalid endpoints."
