      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_b3793171_20250119_120646.html",
      "root_cause": "The parameter 'userUsername=' in the user add page is vulnerable to stored XSS due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
          "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'userUsername' field. When an administrator views the user list, the stored XSS payload executes in the administrator's browser, allowing for session hijacking and other malicious actions, including account takeover. Specifically, an attacker can change the admin's password via CSRF.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker injects a malicious script into the 'userUsername' field when adding a new user.",
          "The attacker can induce the admin to visit the vulnerable page and trigger a CSRF attack to modify the admin password."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a user account with a crafted `userUsername` parameter. The attacker would also need to induce the admin to visit the vulnerable user page."
