Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `set` function within the `bmoor` library. This function allows an attacker to define properties on an object based on a provided path. By manipulating the path value to include `__proto__`, an attacker can inject properties into the prototype of the `Object` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of the `Object` class through the vulnerable `set` function. This is due to a lack of sanitization of the input path, specifically when setting properties.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition:** The `set` function doesn't properly validate or restrict the path provided, allowing access and modification of `__proto__`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions that may lead to DoS. For example, changing `toString` to an integer, causing a failure where a string is expected, or other operations on the prototype.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates a specific property of an object, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code using this vulnerability. For example, where `eval(someobject.someattr)` is used.
*  **Property Injection:** The attacker could also pollute properties that the code relies on, such as security properties like tokens or admin flags. This could allow the attacker to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `set` function of the `bmoor` library. The attacker can control the path and value arguments passed to this function, using it to manipulate the prototype of `Object`.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited if the code makes a call to `bmoor.set(target, path, value)` where the attacker can manipulate `path` to include `__proto__`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Input to `set` Function:** The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` parameter passed to the `bmoor.set` function.
*  **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed over the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `bmoor` prior to 0.8.12.
*   The fix implemented in the referenced commit `7d4a086a1dc3ef11ed0b323824d02348734b7da5` involves adding checks to prevent accessing `__proto__` in the `set` and `get` functions. This mitigates the prototype pollution vulnerability.
