## Denial of Service in Cryptacular

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-x64g-4xx9-fh6x)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-x64g-4xx9-fh6x/dependabot)

## Package

maven

org.cryptacular:cryptacular
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.4
>= 1.2.0, < 1.2.4

## Patched versions

1.1.4
1.2.4

## Description

CiphertextHeader.java in Cryptacular before 1.2.4, as used in Apereo CAS and other products, allows attackers to trigger excessive memory allocation during a decode operation, because the nonce array length associated with "new byte" may depend on untrusted input within the header of encoded data.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
