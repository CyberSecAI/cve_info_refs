```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `CiphertextHeader.decode` method in `cryptacular` allocates a byte array based on the length provided in the header, without proper validation of the length, which allows an attacker to control the size of the array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering excessive memory allocation, leading to the application crashing or becoming unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted ciphertext header with a large nonce length value.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted ciphertext header to a vulnerable application that uses the `CiphertextHeader.decode` method. This can typically be done remotely."
  },
   "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-7226"
}
