## Description

![@willemvermeer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1078847?u=011316cf1fbc257e2d3890868ac5b5f6b4fc5b51&v=4&size=48)[willemvermeer](https://github.com/willemvermeer)opened [on Nov 24, 2020](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session/issues/77#issue-749877064)

Hi again,

Another question about the CSRF protection. It can be bypassed by forging a request that contains the same value for both the X-XSRF-TOKEN header and the XSRF-TOKEN cookie value. Any value will do since the only check that is now performed in randomTokenCsrfProtection is for those two values to be equal and non-empty.

Would it be somehow possible to conform to the OWASP recommendations described [here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) what do you think would be the best approach?

Thanks,

Willem

#### Introduced: 10 Mar 2020

[CVE-2020-7780  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7780) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-352  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.softwaremill.akka-http-session:core_2.11` to version 0.5.11 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). For older versions, endpoints protected by `randomTokenCsrfProtection` could be bypassed with an empty `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header and an empty `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

## Description

![@willemvermeer](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1078847?u=011316cf1fbc257e2d3890868ac5b5f6b4fc5b51&v=4&size=48)[willemvermeer](https://github.com/willemvermeer)opened [on Mar 10, 2020](https://github.com/softwaremill/akka-http-session/issues/74#issue-578574912)

Hi,

When you send a POST to an endpoint protected by randomTokenCsrfProtection and pass in an empty X-XSRF-TOKEN header and a XSRF-TOKEN cookie with empty value, the filter will let you pass.

I think is due to the check in randomTokenCsrfProtection on line 26:

if (submitted == cookie) {

pass

}

but the value itself is not inspected and could possibly be empty.

Hope this can be fixed, thanks,

Willem

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
