Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-7780:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an inadequate check in the `randomTokenCsrfProtection` mechanism of the `akka-http-session` library. The CSRF protection logic only verified if the submitted token and the cookie value were equal, without validating if they were non-empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient CSRF Token Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of the actual token values. The code only checked if the token from the header matches the token in the cookie, but not if these tokens are actually valid, non-empty values.
*   **CSRF Protection Bypass:**  This allowed an attacker to bypass CSRF protection by sending requests with an empty `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header and an empty `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF attacks:** An attacker could craft malicious requests that, when triggered by a victim, could perform unintended actions on the victim's behalf.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized modification of data or other actions that the legitimate user did not intend.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, allowing remote exploitation.
*   **CSRF:** The specific attack is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker could create a malicious website or use other means to induce a victim to make a request to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required**: The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the vulnerable system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, meaning the victim has to be tricked into submitting the malicious request.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests, including setting headers and cookies.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was introduced on March 10, 2020 and was fixed on March 11, 2020.
* Affected versions are prior to 0.5.11
* The fix involved adding a check that the token is not empty as well as matching the cookie.
