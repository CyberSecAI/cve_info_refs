Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7550:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of CGF files within Schneider Electric IGSS. Specifically, the software fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The lack of proper bounds checking on user-provided data allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process running the vulnerable Schneider Electric IGSS software. This means the attacker can potentially take full control of the system, depending on the user's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious CGF file: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CGF file containing the overflow payload.
- User interaction: The user must be tricked into opening this malicious file or visiting a webpage that automatically triggers the processing of the malformed CGF data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious CGF file to the victim or lure the victim to a malicious web page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the system.
- The attacker can be remote (the vulnerability can be triggered remotely).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability requires user interaction to be triggered (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage).
- Schneider Electric has released a patch for this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which indicates that while local access is specified, this also refers to a file accessible via web access, as the user is required to open a file or visit a page.
