Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `eval()` in the `create` function of the `pixl-class` library. Specifically, the `__parent` property of the `members` argument is used to dynamically generate a constructor function using `eval()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The primary weakness is that the `__parent` property, which is passed to `eval()`, can be controlled by a user. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed during class creation.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `members` argument is not sanitized before being passed to the `eval` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server/client where the vulnerable `pixl-class` library is used.
- Full compromise of the affected system can be achieved if the attacker injects malicious code with high privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `members` argument of the `create` function is the entry point. An attacker can pass a malicious object with a `__parent` property containing JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `members` argument passed to the `create` function. This implies that the attacker needs to control the input to the vulnerable application that uses this library.
- No specific privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is within the `class.js` file:
   ```javascript
   var code = members.__parent.toString();
   var args = code.substring( code.indexOf("(")+1, code.indexOf(")") );
   var inner_code = code.substring( code.indexOf("{")+1, code.lastIndexOf("}") );
   eval('constructor = function ('+args+') {'+inner_code+'};');
   ```
   The `eval` function is used to create a constructor using attacker-controlled code taken from `members.__parent`.

**Proof of Concept:**
   ```javascript
   var a = require("pixl-class");
   var members = {
     __parent:'function(){}; console.log(123)//}'
   }
   a.create(members);
   ```
   This POC demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary code, in this case printing 123 to the console.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the use of `eval()` and creating the constructor function in a safer way.
- The fix is available in version 1.0.3 of the library.
