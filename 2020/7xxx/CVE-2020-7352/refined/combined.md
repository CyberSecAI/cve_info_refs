Tell us what this change does. If you're fixing a bug, please mention

the github issue number.

Please ensure you are submitting **from a unique branch** in your [repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/11086#issuecomment-445506416) to master in Rapid7's.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Gain shell on Windows host with GOG Galaxy Client v2.0.12 or earlier.
* `run post/windows/escalate/gog_galaxyclientservice_privesc`
* Verify that a user named `newadmin` was created.
* Optionally, run again with ARGS="localgroup Administrators newadmin /add" to promote to local administrator.

| This should probably be implemented as a `exploit/windows/local` module to retrieve a new session, rather than requiring the operator to manually specify commands. Local exploit modules permit the user to specify a `ARCH_CMD` payload with an arbitrary command if they wish. |

So, I'm probably the easiest path for Metasploit stuff like this, but you're welcome to do it yourself at the CVE Request form, here: <https://cveform.mitre.org/> (Doesn't look like GOG is a CNA).  Let me know if you want to do it yourself, or let me. I'm happy to assign one of R7's research CVEs to this (with you listed as the discoverer, of course).  As an aside, I saw in your writeup a screenshot of the private key you extracted from the binary. Would you mind contributing that to <https://github.com/rapid7/ssh-badkeys> ? That's basically the [naughty step](https://www.supernanny.co.uk/Advice/-/Parenting-Skills/-/Discipline-and-Reward/The-Naughty-Step-~-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work.aspx) for misbehaving keys. |

| Sure, you can make the CVE. And thanks for the info... next time I'll reserve it myself to make things easier. Regarding the private key extracted from the binary: its only used for generating HMAC-512 tags, not for SSH. Would it still be appropriate to submit it to the ssh-badkeys repo in that case? … On 5/13/20 11:05 AM, Tod Beardsley wrote: Hi Grant. Nope, I haven't gotten a CVE yet.

| [@jtesta](https://github.com/jtesta) Your documentation needs proper instructions on where to get the vulnerable versions as well as how to set them up. Also your section `## Scenarios` should also list which version and system you tested this on.  You can refer to [@h00die](https://github.com/h00die)'s PR at <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/13470/files> for an example of how this should be formatted. Note the installation steps he provides, as well as the additional `### Pi-Hole 4.3 with AdminLTE 4.3 on Ubuntu 18.04` section he has under `## Scenarios`. In your case you would need to make this something like `### GOG Galaxy version 1.2.64.2 on Windows 10 1909 x64`.  For your installer steps I took the liberty of finding some appropriate downloads from GOG Galaxy's official servers. They are:  <https://cdn.gog.com/open/galaxy/client/setup_galaxy_1.2.64.2.exe> <https://cdn.gog.com/open/galaxy/client/setup_galaxy_2.0.12.48.exe>  Given that the version number is a 4 part number, not a 3 part number, I would recommend updating your documentation to be more specific as to the versions affected. For example I couldn't find 1.2.64.0, nor could I find 1.2.64.1, so this is something that maybe should be considered in your explanation, whereby you could just say something like `versions 1.2.64.x and prior were affected`.  Otherwise looks good from an initial glance through, but will need to dive into this one deeper to check for additional issues. |

| Does this PR need anything else?  Please update the module to use Metasploit payloads rather than commands specified in module options. This will also require specifying the appropriate `arch` and `platform` in the module `info` Hash.  Optionally, you can also add a second `target` with `ARCH_CMD` for using Windows command payloads, such as powershell commands. Although there's no existing Windows local exploits which do this, there's plenty of other examples from which you can steal code, such as [freeswitch\_event\_socket\_cmd\_exec](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/misc/freeswitch_event_socket_cmd_exec.rb), which offers multiple `targets`. |

| Hi [@jtesta](https://github.com/jtesta), I really enjoyed your writeup on this vulnerability! Just installed the client on a Windows machine, tested out your module, and it works great. As for making the suggested changes, will you have any bandwidth anytime soon? If not, I'd be happy to assist and get your module across the finish line. Thanks! |

| Release Notes The GOG GalaxyClientService Privilege Escalation module that targets vulnerable versions of the gaming software known as GOG Galaxy Client. The `GalaxyClientService` runs as system and listens locally on port 9978 for commands. A user can connect to this service and issue commands to run, allowing for escalation to SYSTEM. |

## Description

The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context. The service listens for such commands on a locally-bound network port, localhost:9978. A Metasploit module has been published which exploits this vulnerability. This issue affects the 2.0.x branch of the software (2.0.12 and earlier) as well as the 1.2.x branch (1.2.64 and earlier). A fix was issued for the 2.0.x branch of the affected software.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
