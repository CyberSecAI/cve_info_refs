Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how CODESYS V3 runtime allocates memory for channel buffers. It reads `MaxChannels` and `BufferSize` settings from the configuration file (`CODESYSControl.cfg`, `Gateway.cfg`). These settings, treated as signed int32 values, can be manipulated to cause a large memory allocation. Specifically, if `BufferSize` is a large positive number (e.g., `0x7fffffff`) and `MaxChannels * 2` results in a negative number due to integer overflow (e.g., `MaxChannels = 0x7fffffff`), the runtime attempts to allocate an excessively large amount of memory from the heap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation and handling of integer values read from the configuration file. This allows an attacker to influence memory allocation size, leading to excessive allocations.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The signed integer type combined with multiplication creates an integer overflow issue, resulting in unexpected memory allocation behavior
*   **Lack of Authentication on GatewayService:**  The `GatewayService.exe` allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to log in anonymously and obtain a session ID, which can then be used to modify settings in the gateway configuration file, amplifying the impact of the memory allocation issue.
*   **Missing User Management:** Unlike `CODESYSControlService.exe`, `GatewayService.exe` does not implement the `CmpUserMgr` component to prevent anonymous access, making it vulnerable to remote configuration modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The excessive memory allocation causes `SysMemAllocData()` to fail, preventing the creation of communication channels. This renders layer 7 services unavailable, severely limiting the runtime's functionality and ultimately leading to a denial-of-service condition. The `GatewayService.exe` will fail upon restart after the attacker modifies the configuration file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Configuration File Modification:** An attacker can remotely modify the configuration file (`Gateway.cfg`) by using the exposed layer 7 service to manipulate `MaxChannels` and `BufferSize` to cause the large memory allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system running CODESYS V3.
*   **Ability to modify configuration:** An attacker needs to be able to modify the configuration files, which is possible due to the missing authentication on the Gateway service and the exposed layer 7 service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all variants of CODESYS V3 products prior to version V3.5.15.30 that contain communication servers. This includes a wide range of systems.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is publicly available, demonstrating the vulnerability, which increases the ease with which an attacker can utilize it.
