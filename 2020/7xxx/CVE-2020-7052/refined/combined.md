# CODESYS V3 Denial of Service

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

When the CODESYS V3 runtime allocates memory for channel buffers, it reads the MaxChannels and BufferSize settings under the [CmpChannelServer] section in the configuration file (i.e., CODESYSControl.cfg, Gateway.cfg). The integer settings in the configuration file are treated as signed int32. If BufferSize is a large positive number (i.e, 0x7fffffff) and MaxChannels \* 2 is a negative number (i.e., MaxChannels = 0x7fffffff), it will cause the runtime to allocate a large number of bytes (i.e., 0x7ffff008) from the heap. This could cause SysMemAllocData() to fail, resulting in an error in the log:

```

01571694396373, 0x0000000a, 4, 17, 0, Failed to allocate memory for channel buffers, no communication channels available

```

When the channel layer (layer 4) is not available, layer 7 services cannot be run, severely limiting the runtime functionalities.

Additionally, we reported a bug that CODESYS has deemed to be an improvement:

GatewayService.exe implements layer 7 service group 6, which allows manipulation (i.e., get, set, remove operations) of settings in the gateway configuration file. To access the layer 7 services, a valid session ID is required. It looks like an unauthenticated, remote attacker could login as an anonymous user to obtain a session ID. On a PLC (i.e., CODESYSControlService.exe) that also implements service group 6, the CmpUserMgr component is seen to be included in the runtime to prevent anonymous access. However, it does not appear the CmpUserMgr component is implemented in GatewayService.exe. So it's unclear whether GatewayService.exe can be configured to prevent an unauthenticated remote attacker from changing the configuration file.

When combining both issues, an unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a DoS on GatewayService.exe when it restarts.

The attached PoC attempts to write the following settings to Gateway.cfg:

```

[CmpChannelServer]
MaxChannels=2147483647
BufferSize=2147483647

```

### Solution

Upgrade to V3.5.15.30.

2.4  Severity Rating

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 7.1 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

CODESYS products like CODESYS Control runtime systems provide communication servers to enable
communication with clients like the CODESYS Development System. Crafted requests may cause an
uncontrolled memory allocation in the affected CODESYS products, which may result in a denial-of-service
condition.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

© 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH

CODESYS   Inspiring Automation Solutions

4/6

Advisory 2020-01

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

POC is publicly available.

4  Available software updates

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released version V3.5.15.30 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for
all affected CODESYS products.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

5  Mitigation

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability for
all affected CODESYS products.

In general, the CODESYS online user management should be activated whenever possible. If the patch could
not be applied, the active CODESYS online user management protects the CODESYS Control runtime system
from such malicious requests. For products without online user management, 3S-Smart Software Solutions
GmbH has not yet identified a specific workaround for this vulnerability.

As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense
measures to reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].

6  Acknowledgments

3S - Smart Software Solutions GmbH thanks those in the security community, who help us to improve our
products and to protect customers and users through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

We thank Tenable, Inc. for reporting this vulnerability following coordinated disclosure.
