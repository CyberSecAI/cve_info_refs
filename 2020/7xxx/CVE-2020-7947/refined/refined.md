Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of CSV injection vulnerabilities in the Auth0 WordPress plugin. This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being included in a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection:**  The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection, a type of vulnerability that arises when user-controlled input is not correctly sanitized when being included in a CSV file. When opened with spreadsheet software, this data can be interpreted as commands or formulas, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the crafted CSV is opened in spreadsheet software, the injected formulas or commands could be executed, leading to arbitrary code execution. This can allow an attacker to gain control of the user's system.
- **Data Manipulation:**  The malicious CSV could also be used to alter or manipulate data within the spreadsheet, potentially causing misinformation or financial losses.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use the CSV to extract or exfiltrate sensitive data from the spreadsheet, depending on the commands/formulas injected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSV Download:** The primary attack vector is through a CSV export functionality of the Auth0 WordPress plugin. This export likely includes unsanitized user input.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker has to persuade the victim to download and open the malicious CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Plugin User Account:** The attacker needs to have the capability to cause the export of data including the manipulated input that is then injected into the CSV. This would mean the attacker has access to the wordpress plugin where this functionality is available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in versions 3.11.3 and earlier of the Auth0 WordPress plugin.
- Upgrading to version 4.0.0 or higher fixes the vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update: CSRF, XSS, and Insecure direct object reference.
