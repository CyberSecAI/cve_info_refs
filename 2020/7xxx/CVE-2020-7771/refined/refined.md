Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7771:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a prototype pollution issue in the `asciitable.js` library. This arises from how the library handles user-provided options.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The library is vulnerable to prototype pollution via the main function.  Specifically, the library is susceptible to an unsafe object recursive merge.  An attacker can inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects using the `__proto__` attribute.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting  `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g., non-function values for functions), it can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the codebase evaluates an object's attribute and executes it (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` with malicious code that will be executed.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject properties that the application relies on for informative value, including security properties. This can lead to privilege escalation or bypassing of security checks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the library's main function.  An attacker provides a malicious JSON input which is then processed by the vulnerable recursive merge functionality or property definition by path.  The attacker can control the `__proto__` attribute of the input and use this to pollute the prototype.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `asciitable.js` library. Specifically, they must be able to provide a JSON object with a `__proto__` property. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.3 of `asciitable.js`.
- The Snyk vulnerability database entry provides a proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating how the prototype pollution can be achieved.
- The Snyk entry also offers information on how to prevent prototype pollution in general, such as freezing prototypes, requiring schema validation, and avoiding unsafe recursive merges.
- The vulnerability was first disclosed on November 12, 2020, and the CVE was published on January 4, 2021.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-1321, which is related to improper handling of object prototypes.
