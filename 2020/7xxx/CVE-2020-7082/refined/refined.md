Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-7082:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability in Autodesk's FBX SDK.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free. This occurs when an application attempts to access memory after it has been freed, potentially leading to the use of a dangling pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. By exploiting the use-after-free, an attacker can potentially overwrite memory with malicious code, thereby gaining control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a malicious FBX file. An attacker can craft a specially designed FBX file that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability when opened by a vulnerable application using the FBX SDK.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious FBX file to a victim and induce the victim to open the file with a vulnerable application.

**Affected Products:** Applications and services utilizing the FBX SDK version 2020.0 or earlier are vulnerable. Specific affected Autodesk products include:
- FBX-SDK (versions 2019.5 and earlier)
- Maya (2017, 2018, 2019)
- Motion Builder (2018, 2019)
- Mudbox (2018, 2019)
- 3ds Max (2018, 2019)
- Fusion (ATF 8 and earlier)
- Flame (2017, 2018, 2019)
- Infraworks (2020 all versions, 2021.0)

- Civil 3D (2017, 2018, 2019)
- AutoCAD P&ID (2017)
- AutoCAD based specialized toolsets (2017, 2018, 2019)

**Mitigations:** Upgrade to the patched versions of the affected Autodesk products or apply the available hotfixes.  Third-party developers using the FBX SDK should update to the latest version.
