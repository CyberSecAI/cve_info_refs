Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a Prototype Pollution flaw in the `safe-object2` npm package's `setter` function. Specifically, the function allows modification of the prototype of JavaScript objects by using a path that includes `__proto__`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is that the `setter` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input path, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by setting a property on the `__proto__` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values (like changing a function to an integer), the attacker can cause the application to fail when the polluted object is used. This can lead to a denial of service condition.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where the application evaluates attributes of an object (e.g., using `eval()`), an attacker could inject malicious code into the prototype and achieve remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties that the codebase relies on, such as user roles or permissions (`isAdmin`), potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily through the manipulation of the `setter` function of the `safe-object2` package.
*   An attacker can control the path argument, injecting `__proto__` into the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `setter` function, specifically the 'path' argument.
*   No user interaction or privileges are required for the exploitation.
* The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack so the attack can be remote.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability. The code uses `obj.setter(['__proto__', 'polluted'], true)` to add a `polluted` property to `Object.prototype`.
*   The vulnerability falls under the "Property definition by path" category of Prototype Pollution attacks, as the `setter` function allows defining values on an object based on a given path.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Snyk report indicates that the vulnerability has a high severity, with a CVSS score of 7.5 (Snyk) and 9.8 (NVD).
*   The report provides ways to prevent Prototype Pollution, such as freezing the prototype, schema validation, avoiding unsafe merge functions, using objects without prototypes, and using Map instead of Object.
*   There is no fixed version of the `safe-object2` package, which means that the user must apply a mitigation mentioned above.
