Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the Distributed Ruby (DRb) library in the Metasploit Framework's `exploit/linux/misc/drb_remote_codeexec` module. When this module is used to target a malicious DRb server, the Metasploit instance itself becomes vulnerable due to insecure deserialization practices within DRb. Specifically, the Metasploit Framework running the exploit would expose a DRb service. The server targeted by the Metasploit module, if malicious, can then exploit the running instance of Metasploit to gain code execution within the context of the user running Metasploit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The DRb library, as used by the Metasploit module, is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. This means that it can be tricked into executing arbitrary code if provided with specially crafted serialized data.
*   **Unnecessary DRb Service:** The module was starting an unnecessary DRb service, exposing it to a similar exploit as the target.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The module did not properly validate or sanitize the input it receives from the targeted DRb server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution on Metasploit Host:** A malicious DRb server can exploit a Metasploit instance using the vulnerable `drb_remote_codeexec` module, leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running Metasploit. This could result in full system compromise if the Metasploit instance has elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network, with the Metasploit instance connecting to a malicious DRb server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious DRb Server:** The attacker needs to control a malicious DRb server that the Metasploit user would target.
*   **User Interaction:** The Metasploit user needs to be enticed to run the `drb_remote_codeexec` module against the malicious DRb server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the DRb deserialization vulnerability to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was privately reported to the Metasploit project.
*   The vulnerability was initially addressed in pull request #14300 by disabling the DRb service in the Metasploit module and adding a check method.
*   A subsequent pull request #14335 removed the module entirely due to the difficulty in fully mitigating the vulnerability and the risk it posed.
*   The Metasploit Framework is only vulnerable when the drb\_remote\_codeexec module is running, which does not happen automatically.
*   The attacker would need to wait for a Metasploit user to run the module against the malicious server in a "hack-back" scenario.
*   The attacker could exploit the Metasploit module with the Metasploit module prior to the patch.
*   The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8.
*   User interaction is required.
*   No privileges are required to exploit this, as the user running Metasploit is assumed to have the necessary privileges.
