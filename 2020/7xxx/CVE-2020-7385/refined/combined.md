This removes the DRuby RCE module (`exploit/linux/misc/drb_remote_codeexec`).

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start `msfconsole`
* See that the module is no longer present

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[zeroSteiner](/zeroSteiner)** commented [Nov 2, 2020](#issuecomment-720502565)

| A vulnerability was disclosed to use regarding this module. While [#14300](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/14300) fixed instances where an arbitrary third party attacker could exploit Metasploit Framework users who had run this module and inadvertently started a DRuby service of their own, I failed to address the scenario where the server targeted by the Metasploit Framework user was malicious. In this second case, this module poses a threat in that the malicious server that is targeted could exploit the running instance of Metasploit to gain code execution within the context of the user running Metasploit. I looked into fixing it without removing the module but was unable to find a way to configure an allowlist of input items for processing. It's likely that a proper solution would involve a lower level implementation of the DRuby stack that's not easily provided through Ruby's API. This didn't seem like it was worth the effort and time it would take for this particular module as the vulnerability would still be present while that development was underway. |

## Description

By launching the drb\_remote\_codeexec exploit, a Metasploit Framework user will inadvertently expose Metasploit to the same deserialization issue that is exploited by that module, due to the reliance on the vulnerable Distributed Ruby class functions. Since Metasploit Framework typically runs with elevated privileges, this can lead to a system compromise on the Metasploit workstation. Note that an attacker would have to lie in wait and entice the Metasploit user to run the affected module against a malicious endpoint in a ‚Äúhack-back‚Äù type of attack. Metasploit is only vulnerable when the drb\_remote\_codeexec module is running. In most cases, this cannot happen automatically.

### @zeroSteiner **[zeroSteiner](/zeroSteiner)** commented [Oct 22, 2020](#issue-727571705) ‚Ä¢ edited by bwatters-r7 Loading

By far the most important change this PR makes is in commit [49145bf](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/49145bfd31a4fa61694922fbe03e67e0f05d9cec). This fixes a security issue whereby a user who has run the `exploit/linux/misc/drb_remote_codeexec` is vulnerable to it themselves. This was issue was privately reported to the Metasploit project through our [vulnerability disclosure](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/.github/SECURITY.md) process. All credit to Jeff Dileo of NCC Group for reporting this vulnerability.

While testing this vulnerability I found that we could simply remove the affected service in question. Prior to this patch, a new instance of the service would be started each time the module was executed. Only one DRuby service instance is necessary to be vulnerable but either way this is a leak that should be addressed. After removing the service I tested each of the targets to ensure that none were dependent on it which led me to issues with the syscall target. The explicit delay between the fork and exec was enough to fix this for me. With this in place the default/instance\_eval target and syscall targets are working for me. The trap target did not work for me before or after this patch, so that's still an outstanding issue from what I can tell.

I also added a check method. This can be used to check for vulnerable instances of DRuby services, both from Metasploit and otherwise.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start a target server, using the **client.rb** script below
  + No seriously, use the client, the server runs but for reasons I haven't identified it's not vulnerable to exploitation because the MSF module's methods don't work.
  + Once the client is running (use `ruby client.rb`), use the PID it prints out to find TCP ports that it's listening on. There should be a high port that's used for the DRuby service. Note this port down, it'll be used for the rest of testing. Don't hit enter so it stays running.
* Validate that the patch fixes the vulnerability
  + **Optionally** reproduce the original issue
    - Start a vulnerable (unpatched) instance of `msfconsole`
    - Set the options as appropriate to target the **client.rb** instance and run the exploit, get a shell using the Autotomatic / Eval target
    - Get the PID of Metasploit using `irb -e "puts 'msfconsole pid: ' + Process.pid.to_s"`
    - Find the high port that Metasploit has opened, ignore the port used by the session if you left that open.
    - Set the RHOST and RPORT options to target Metasploit and run the exploit again, get a shell üò¶
  + Start a patched instance of `msfconsole`
  + Set the options as appropriate to target the **client.rb** instance and run the exploit, get a shell using the Autotomatic / Eval target
  + Get the PID of Metasploit using `irb -e "puts 'msfconsole pid: ' + Process.pid.to_s"`
  + See there are no open services opened by Metasploit, ignore the port used by the session if you left that open. üòÑ
* Test the check method
  + Targeting the client.rb script as privously described, it should be identified as vulnerable

## Example

In the following example, the address of the machine running Metasploit is 192.168.159.128

```

   RPORT   36711            yes       The target port

Payload options (cmd/unix/reverse_netcat):

   Name   Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----   ---------------  --------  -----------
   LHOST  192.168.159.128  yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT  4444             yes       The listen port

## Resources

The following two scripts helped me through this process. The originals came from the [Ruby 2.7.1 Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/drb/rdoc/DRb.html).

DRuby Client
```
require 'drb/drb'

SERVER_URI="druby://localhost:8787"

DRb.start_service

puts "running in pid: #{Process.pid}"
puts "press enter to continue"
gets

log_service=DRbObject.new_with_uri(SERVER_URI)

["loga", "logb", "logc"].each do |logname|

    logger=log_service.get_logger(logname)

    logger.log("Hello, world!")
    logger.log("Goodbye, world!")
    logger.log("=== EOT ===")

end
```

DRuby Server
```
require 'drb/drb'

URI="druby://localhost:8787"

class Logger

    # Make dRuby send Logger instances as dRuby references,
    # not copies.
    include DRb::DRbUndumped

    def initialize(n, fname)
        @name = n
        @filename = fname
    end

    def log(message)
        File.open(@filename, "a") do |f|
            f.puts("#{Time.now}: #{@name}: #{message}")
        end
    end

end

# We have a central object for creating and retrieving loggers.
# This retains a local reference to all loggers created.  This
# is so an existing logger can be looked up by name, but also
# to prevent loggers from being garbage collected.  A dRuby
# reference to an object is not sufficient to prevent it being
# garbage collected!
class LoggerFactory

    def initialize(bdir)
        @basedir = bdir
        @loggers = {}
    end

    def get_logger(name)
        if !@loggers.has_key? name
            # make the filename safe, then declare it to be so
            fname = name.gsub(/[.\/\\:]/, "_")
            @loggers[name] = Logger.new(name, @basedir + "/" + fname)
        end
        return @loggers[name]
    end

end

Dir.mkdir("/tmp/dlog") unless File.exist?("/tmp/dlog")
FRONT_OBJECT=LoggerFactory.new("/tmp/dlog")

DRb.start_service(URI, FRONT_OBJECT)
DRb.thread.join

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
