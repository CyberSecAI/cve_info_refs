Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `set` function within the `sds` package. Specifically, the function does not properly sanitize user-provided input for key paths when setting properties on objects. This allows an attacker to inject `__proto__` into the key path, leading to Prototype Pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype` by injecting `__proto__` into the key path. This is due to the insufficient input validation in the `set` function located in `js/set.js`.
- The vulnerable code is located here: `https://github.com/monsterkodi/sds/blob/master/js/set.js#L31`
- Specifically the `indexOf.call(keypath, '__proto__') >= 0` check is insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although the provided text mentions a ReDoS example, this vulnerability is not directly a ReDoS.  However, Prototype Pollution can lead to denial of service by modifying the prototype of objects, possibly breaking expected functionality of applications.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly mentioned, Prototype Pollution can also be leveraged for arbitrary code execution in some circumstances, especially if the polluted properties are later accessed in an unsafe way.
- **Other Undefined Behavior:** Modification of prototypes can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Manipulation of Key Path:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted key path containing `__proto__` to the `set` function. The `set` function takes an object, a key path string (or array), and a value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable `set` function with attacker-controlled key paths and values. This usually requires the attacker to have some level of control over the input provided to the `sds` package.

**Additional Details:**

- **Proof of Concept:** A PoC is provided, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability by setting a property on `__proto__` and showing how this affects all subsequently created objects.
```javascript
var root = require("sds");
var payload = "__proto__.jhu";
root.set({},payload,true);
console.log({}.jhu);
```
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of the `sds` package prior to `4.0.0` are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The recommended fix is to upgrade the `sds` package to version `4.0.0` or higher.
- The CVSS score is 4 (Medium) according to Snyk.
- The CVSS vector is `AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L`
