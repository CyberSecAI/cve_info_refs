{
  "CVE-2020-7041": {
    "root_cause": "The `tunnel.c` in openfortivpn mishandles certificate validation by interpreting a negative error code from `X509_check_host` as a successful return value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling",
      "Improper certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass certificate validation, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack where a malicious server could impersonate a legitimate server, potentially exposing sensitive user data",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network attack"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the openfortivpn client and the VPN server. Additionally, they need to present a server certificate with a hostname that would not pass strict validation."
