Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `set` function of the `@eivifj/dot` npm package. The `set` function allowed modification of the `Object.prototype` by using a `__proto__` payload in the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype` through the `set` function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
*  **Lack of Input Validation**: The `set` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input path, allowing the injection of `__proto__`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While the provided text includes a section on ReDoS, it is not directly related to the specific vulnerability of CVE-2020-7639. The prototype pollution can cause unpredictable behavior by modifying the prototype of all objects, which can lead to application crashes and/or unexpected outcomes that would render the application unusable.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By modifying the prototype, attackers can potentially inject malicious properties or override existing methods, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `set` function of the `@eivifj/dot` package by providing a crafted path that includes `__proto__`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the path argument passed to the vulnerable `set` function.
*   Low privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.3 of the package.
*   The fix included adding a check using the `isSafe` function within the set function to prevent the manipulation of `__proto__`.

**Proof of Concept:**
The provided PoC clearly demonstrates the prototype pollution:
```javascript
var a = require("eivindfjeldstad-dot")
var path = "__proto__.toString";
a.set({},path,"JHU");
console.log({}.toString);
```
This code snippet shows how the `toString` method of `Object.prototype` can be modified using the `set` function.
