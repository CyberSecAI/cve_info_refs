SSA-886514: Persistent XSS Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface of
Climatix POL908 and POL909 Modules

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.1

2020-04-14
2021-02-09
V1.1

SUMMARY

The Climatix BACnet/IP (POL908) and AWM (POL909) modules contain two persistent cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerabilities in the web interface that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript
code in the context of other users’ web sessions.

Siemens has released an update for Climatix POL909 and recommends to update to the latest version.
Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Update Climatix POL908 and POL909 to V11.22 or later version. These versions disable the web

interface by default, as it is no longer needed in standard use cases.

• Climatix POL908 is designed to be operated in protected BACnet/IP networks only. Do not connect
it to other networks, such as an Ofﬁce LAN or the Internet. Also consider to remove POL908,
in case the integrated BACnet/IP implementation in newer versions of Climatix 600 controllers is
already sufﬁcient for your environment.

The remaining mitigation measures apply only, if the web interface is activated (e.g. via the Climatix
SCOPE tool):

• Climatix POL909: When conﬁguring your custom web application, disable the access to the default

web pages provided by POL909

• Enforce authentication for the web interface, and change the default password of the standard

ADMIN user

• Disable JavaScript within the web browser used to access the web server of Climatix POL908

• Utilize a modern web browser with integrated XSS ﬁltering mechanisms

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to

run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Climatix BACnet/IP communication module (POL908) integrates Climatix 600 controllers into BAC-
net/IP (BACnet over Internet Protocol) networks.

The Climatix AWM (Advanced Web Module, POL909) enables the user of a Climatix 600 solution to
implement and load customer Web pages and functions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7574

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the “Server Conﬁg” web interface of the
affected devices that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. The code could be
potentially executed later by another (possibly privileged) user.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges. An attacker could use the vulnerability to
compromise the conﬁdentiality and integrity of other users’ web session.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7575

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web server access log page of the
affected devices that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via specially crafted
GET requests. The code could be potentially executed later by another (privileged) user.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges. An attacker could use the vulnerability to
compromise the conﬁdentiality and integrity of other users’ web sessions.
