Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7576:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating containers, packages, or registering defects. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server. When other users access this content, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** If successfully exploited, an attacker could steal the session cookies of legitimate users. This allows the attacker to hijack the session and perform arbitrary actions within the application, acting with the privileges of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by injecting malicious scripts through the web interface.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to be authenticated and have the ability to create containers, packages, or register defects to inject the XSS payload, which would affect other users when they view or interact with the injected content

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Specific Privileges:** The attacker must have the ability to create containers, packages, or register defects.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was not fixed in version V8.2 of Opcenter Execution Core.
- It also mentions the remediation requires updating to Opcenter Execution Core V8.4 or later.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
