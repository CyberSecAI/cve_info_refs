Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7673

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `extend` function in `lib/extend.js` uses `eval` to process user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The `eval` function allows the execution of arbitrary code provided in the input. This is a classic code injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization: The `extend` function does not properly sanitize or validate the user-provided input before passing it to `eval`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server or client-side, depending on where the vulnerable code is used.
- **Confidentiality Loss:** Complete loss of confidentiality because the attacker can access any resources within the component.
- **Integrity Loss:**  Modification of data is possible, with potentially serious impact.
- **Availability Loss:**  Performance may be reduced or interrupted but not completely denied.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, potentially across the internet.
- User-provided input: The vulnerability is triggered by user-provided input to the `extend` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input to the `extend` function.
- No authentication or special access is required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `node-extend` package.
- There is no fixed version available for the package.
- A proof-of-concept is available showing how to trigger the vulnerability using the `extend` function with malicious input to execute code.
- The CVSS score is rated as high 8.6 by Snyk and critical 9.8 by NVD.
- The vulnerability was disclosed and published on June 5, 2020.
