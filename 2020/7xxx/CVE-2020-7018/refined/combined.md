Hi,

The CVE-2020-7018 has a fix in 7.9.0 version and the fix for users who couldn't update to this version is specified here [Enterprise Search 7.9.0 security update](https://discuss.elastic.co/t/enterprise-search-7-9-0-security-update/245457)

I wanted to know if there will be a new release fixing CVE-2020-7018 in 6.x version or the solution provided in the above link is the final one. If there is a release of 6.x version, when it will be released.

Regards,

Manjunath

Hello Manjunath,

There is no 6.x version of Enterprise search.

CVE-2020-7018 affects Elastic Enterprise Search, not the Elastic Stack (which there is a 6.x version). If you are running Elastic Stack 6.x you do not need to take any actions for this particular vulnerability.

**Enterprise Search credential exposure flaw (ESA-2020-11)**

Elastic Enterprise Search versions before 7.9.0 contain a credential exposure flaw in the App Search interface. If a user is given the ‘developer’ role, they will be able to view the administrator API credentials. These credentials could allow the developer user to conduct operations with the same permissions of the App Search administrator.

Thanks to Matt Peel of Silverstripe for reporting this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions**

All versions before 7.9.0

**Solutions and Mitigations**

Users should upgrade to Enterprise Search version 7.9.0. Users unable to upgrade can remove the developer role from App Search users and reset their existing API keys.

**CVSSv3: 4.8 - AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N**

**CVE ID: CVE-2020-7018**
