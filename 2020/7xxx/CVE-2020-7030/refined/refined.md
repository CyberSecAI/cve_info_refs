Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Avaya IP Office web interface passing Base64 encoded credentials within the URL query string for both HTTP requests on port 7071 and WebSocket connections on port 7070. This occurs when the Atmosphere-Framework is used for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Transit of Credentials:** Usernames and passwords, encoded in Base64, are transmitted as part of the URL, making them easily visible in various locations. Base64 encoding is not encryption, and is easily decoded.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The credentials, due to their exposure in URLs, are vulnerable to being leaked or stored in browser history, caches, developer tools, web proxies, referer headers, web logs, and shared systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A local attacker who gains access to the machine used to log in to the web interface of the Avaya IP Office can potentially extract the Base64 encoded credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** Successfully decoded credentials grant the attacker unauthorized access to the system's web management interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to a machine that has logged into the Avaya IP Office web management interface.
*   **Passive Information Gathering:** The attacker does not need to actively exploit the system, but can retrieve credentials from locations where the URL (with encoded credentials) may be stored or leaked.
*   **Network access:** The vulnerable web interface is accessible remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user or access to local system:** The attacker must be able to access the user's machine that has connected to the Avaya IP Office web interface to access the credential information.
*   **Network visibility (Optional):** Although not strictly required, an attacker with network access could potentially intercept the requests or access web server logs.

**Affected Products/Versions:**

*   Avaya IP Office versions 9.x, 10.0 through 10.1.0.7, and 11.0 through 11.0.4.2.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Avaya IP Office version 10.1.0.8 or 11.0.4.3 or later, where the vulnerability is resolved.
*   Implement network security best practices such as firewalls, ACLs, and physical access controls.
*   Customers should follow Avaya's recommendations for security best practices.

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.5 (Medium)
*   CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
