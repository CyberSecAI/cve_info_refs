Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-7460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue in the FreeBSD kernel's `compat32` subsystem when handling the `sendmsg` system call for 32-bit processes on 64-bit platforms. Specifically, the code that copies and adjusts control messages within the `sendmsg` call lacks proper locking, allowing a malicious user-space program to modify control message headers after they have been validated by the kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **TOCTOU Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the TOCTOU issue. The kernel checks the control message headers, then copies and aligns them, but does not ensure that the headers aren't modified before use.
*   **Lack of Locking:**  The absence of proper locking mechanisms while handling the control message in the `sendmsg` system call allows for the race condition to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to that of the kernel.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the kernel context.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **32-bit Process:** The vulnerability is triggered when a 32-bit process makes a `sendmsg` call on a 64-bit FreeBSD system.
*   **Malicious Control Message:** The attacker manipulates the control message headers after the initial kernel checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system as a low-privileged user.
*   **Knowledge of Kernel Internals:** The attacker needs to understand how the `sendmsg` system call works and how the `compat32` subsystem handles control messages, in order to craft a successful exploit.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is specific to 64-bit FreeBSD systems running 32-bit binaries using the `compat32` subsystem.
*   The issue affects `sendmsg` (and likely `recvmsg`) calls.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by FreeBSD with a patch.
*   NetApp products that incorporate FreeBSD were also potentially affected but the provided advisory states they are not.
