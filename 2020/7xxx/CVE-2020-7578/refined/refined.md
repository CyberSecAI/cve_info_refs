Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7578:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access control, which allows authenticated users to access resources they shouldn't have.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The application fails to properly restrict access to resources based on user roles or permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view internal information that they are not authorized to see.
- **Unauthorized Changes:** The vulnerability could also allow an attacker to make unauthorized modifications to the application or its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges:** The attacker could potentially be a low-privileged user who can leverage the access control flaw to gain access to resources they should not have.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-7578 is a privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper access control in Siemens Opcenter Execution Core. An authenticated attacker with low privileges could exploit this to gain unauthorized access to resources, potentially leading to information disclosure and unauthorized changes.
