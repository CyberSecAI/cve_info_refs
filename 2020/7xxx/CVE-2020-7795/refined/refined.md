Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7795:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `get-npm-package-version` package is vulnerable to command injection. The vulnerability lies in the `index.js` file, where the `packageName` argument is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The main vulnerability is that the package takes user-controlled input (`packageName`) and uses it to construct a shell command. By injecting malicious shell commands into `packageName`, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable code. This allows the attacker to potentially compromise the entire system, leading to data breaches, system downtime, or other malicious activities.
*   The CVSS score from Snyk is 7.3 (High), while NVD gives a score of 9.8 (Critical).
*   The Snyk data mentions that there is a possibility of some loss of confidentiality, some data integrity modification, and some reduction in resource availability; however, the impact of these is limited.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is accessible over the network and thus is remotely exploitable. Attackers can inject malicious commands through the `packageName` parameter when calling the vulnerable function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any special access or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No user interaction:** The attack can be carried out without any user interaction.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `packageName` argument passed to the vulnerable function.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected versions:** Versions of `get-npm-package-version` prior to `1.0.7` are vulnerable.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject a simple command `touch JHU` through the `packageName` parameter which, if vulnerable, will create an empty file named 'JHU'.
*  The fix for this vulnerability includes a check for special characters in the `packageName` and `registry` parameters which prevents the injection of shell commands.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to version 1.0.7 or higher.
