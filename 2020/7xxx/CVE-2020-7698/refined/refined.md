Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `gerapy` package. Specifically, the `project_configure` endpoint does not properly sanitize input passed to the `Popen` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to command injection because it constructs shell commands using unsanitized user-supplied input (project name).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `project_configure` endpoint fails to properly sanitize the `project_name` parameter before using it in a command execution via `Popen`. Although there is a regex filter, it is insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the `gerapy` application by injecting malicious commands.
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.  The attacker can potentially steal sensitive data, modify system files, and/or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable over the network or even the internet.
- **HTTP Endpoint:** The attack is initiated through the `project_configure` endpoint of the `gerapy` application's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `gerapy` application's API endpoint.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require prior authentication or any access to the vulnerable system to exploit this vulnerability.
