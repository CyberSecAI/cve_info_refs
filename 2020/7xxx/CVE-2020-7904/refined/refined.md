The provided content relates to CVE-2020-7904.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Some Maven repositories were accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure communication: The use of HTTP instead of HTTPS for accessing Maven repositories exposes the communication to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: An attacker could intercept the HTTP traffic and potentially modify downloaded artifacts or inject malicious code.
- Compromise of build process: If malicious artifacts are injected, it could compromise the software build process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network interception: An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between IntelliJ IDEA and the Maven repositories could perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic. This could be achieved through a compromised network or by being on the same network as the user.
