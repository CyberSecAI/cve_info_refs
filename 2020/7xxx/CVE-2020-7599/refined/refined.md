Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin exposing pre-signed AWS S3 URLs in build logs when the logging level was set to `info` or `debug`. These URLs, used for uploading plugin artifacts to the Gradle Plugin Portal, were valid for 1 hour and could be reused.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The pre-signed AWS S3 URL, which is considered sensitive, was being logged. This is an instance of CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).
- **Insecure Handling of Credentials:** The plugin was generating long-lived, reusable pre-signed URLs and not sufficiently protecting them from exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the build logs containing the exposed AWS S3 URL could overwrite plugin artifacts on the Gradle Plugin Portal within the 1-hour validity window. This could lead to:
- **Supply chain attacks:** By replacing a legitimate plugin with a malicious one, attackers could compromise systems and applications using that plugin.
- **Compromised Software:** Users of the replaced plugin would unknowingly use a malicious version.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Build Log Access:** Attackers could obtain the pre-signed S3 URLs by accessing publicly available build logs. This is especially relevant on CI systems where logs can sometimes be publicly accessible.
- **Log Level Configuration:** The attack requires the build to be run with either the `--info` or `--debug` logging level enabled, which are commonly used for debugging and investigation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Build Logs:** The attacker needs to gain access to build logs where pre-signed AWS S3 URLs are logged. This could be from publicly available CI systems, internal build systems, or leaked logs.
- **Timely Action:** The attacker needs to act within the 1-hour validity of the pre-signed URL to overwrite artifacts.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Portal:** The attacker needs to know how to use the pre-signed URL to upload and overwrite plugin artifacts in the Gradle Plugin Portal.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**
- The vulnerability was reported by Danny Thomas from Netflix.
- Gradle audited over 190,000 artifacts on the Plugin Portal, to confirm that no artifacts were compromised maliciously. 12 artifacts were identified where checksum mismatches existed and were reviewed for any malicious changes.
- Gradle shortened the lifespan of the pre-signed URL after discovering the vulnerability and required an upgrade to `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin version 0.11.0 or higher.
- Gradle also contacted several major CI providers to help identify projects that may have been exposing the pre-signed URL in their build logs.
- The vulnerability was mitigated in `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin version 0.11.0 by reducing the log level of the pre-signed URL and invalidating old versions of the plugin.

This analysis indicates a critical vulnerability that could have led to a significant supply chain attack. The detailed explanation from Gradle's blog post provides valuable context and insight into the incident.
