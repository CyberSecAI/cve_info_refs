## Important update when publishing plugins to the Plugin Portal [#](#important-update-when-publishing-plugins-to-the-plugin-portal)

A security vulnerability was reported to us on March 4th, 2020. This problem could allow an authorized person to overwrite plugin artifacts on the Plugin Portal if they had access to the build logs that published the plugin. After a thorough investigation, we found no artifacts were overwritten for a malicious purpose.

In response, we’ve published a new version of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin that contains an update to mitigate this security vulnerability.

Please upgrade [`com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish) to version `0.11.0`. Old versions of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin will **no longer work**. If you do not publish plugins to the [Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/), you do not need to do anything.

We also recommend that builds handling sensitive information (like publishing builds) do not run with elevated log levels (like `--debug` with Gradle) and are kept private to minimize the damage that can be done if sensitive information is exposed. You should also follow the best practices of your CI provider to avoid leaking sensitive information into build logs ([as an example, Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/best-practices-security/#recommendations-on-how-to-avoid-leaking-secrets-to-build-logs)). Like other software, build maintainers and plugin authors need to keep in mind the types of information that may be logged.

This post is a summary of what we found and how we verified that artifacts served by the Plugin Portal were not changed. Continue reading if you’re interested in what we uncovered.

### Discovery of the Vulnerability [#](#discovery-of-the-vulnerability)

On March 4th, 2020, we were notified about a security vulnerability with uploads to the Plugin Portal. The vulnerability could allow anyone with access to the log file from the build that published the plugins to overwrite the plugin’s artifacts when `info` level logging is enabled. This is an information disclosure vulnerability ([CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html)) for the Plugin Publish Plugin and is tracked by [CVE-2020-7599](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7599).

Thanks to [Danny Thomas](https://github.com/DanielThomas) from Netflix for reporting this issue to us.

When a plugin is published to the Plugin Portal, a [pre-signed AWS S3 URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) is passed to the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin to upload artifacts. This URL was valid for 1 hour and could be re-used. By default, this URL was never shown to the user, but if the build ran with an elevated log level (`--info` or `--debug`), the pre-signed URL was captured in the build log file. With this URL, an attacker could then overwrite the plugin’s artifacts within that 1 hour window.

In general, it’s important that publicly facing builds be cautious with what is logged to their build output. Most CI systems attempt to filter out sensitive data from build logs, but in some cases, they may not hide everything; none of the CI providers filter these kinds of URLs as far as we know. Running your build with `debug` level logging can expose sensitive information about your infrastructure, passwords or internal web endpoints. This vulnerability was made possible with builds that ran with `info` level logging enabled.

### Remediation and Investigation [#](#remediation-and-investigation)

After our investigation, we found no maliciously overwritten artifacts.

Once we became aware of the vulnerability, we deployed a change to limit the lifespan of the pre-signed URL. This greatly shortened the window of attack. Due to the way the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin works, the URL needs to remain valid for some amount of time to allow for all of the artifacts to be published.

We also investigated if any artifacts had been compromised. When publishing an artifact to the Plugin Portal, the client reports the SHA256 checksum of the artifact they intend to upload. We record that checksum, which allowed us to compare the original checksum against the checksum of each artifact in the S3 bucket. If the checksum of the artifact in the S3 bucket did not match the original checksum, this may indicate that the artifact was overwritten.

We audited all of the artifacts (over 190,000) available in the Plugin Portal for mismatched artifact hashes. We performed this comparison by downloading the contents of the S3 bucket and comparing the actual SHA256 checksums against our database. We initially identified over 9000 mismatches, but the vast majority of these artifacts were not accessible to users via the Plugin Portal. These artifacts were created for plugins that were deleted or that failed to publish all of their artifacts completely. Only 12 artifacts failed the checksum match and were served from the Plugin Portal. We investigated each of these to determine if they were compromised.

The artifacts consisted of

* non-executable artifacts, like source, javadoc and groovydoc that did not contain class files (4)
* artifacts that were mismatched due to an earlier, unrelated, security investigation (2)
* artifacts that were produced by a non-public build (2)
* an artifact that was intentionally changed while investigating this vulnerability
* a jar file that contained only timestamp differences when built locally
* a pom file with no suspicious content
* an invalid jar file

None of the artifacts appear to be different in a meaningful way or could have been compromised for a malicious purpose.

We also reached out to several major cloud CI providers to help identify projects that may have been exposing the pre-signed URL in their build logs. We would like to thank the GitHub and CircleCI IR Teams for both being very proactive with their assistance.

### Has the problem been patched? What version should I upgrade to? [#](#has-the-problem-been-patched-what-version-should-i-upgrade-to)

We have published a new version of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin that reduces the log level for the pre-signed URL. Please upgrade `com.gradle.plugin-publish` to version `0.11.0`. Previous versions of this plugin **no longer work** and will be rejected by the Plugin Portal.

These changes mitigate the exposure of the sensitive URL, but it’s still important that publicly facing builds be cautious with what is logged to their build output. Running Gradle with `--debug` will still expose the pre-signed URL. Internal JDK logging will log all HTTP requests–not just the artifact URLs.

Going forward, we will be making updates to the Plugin Portal to detect overwritten artifacts and to increase the security around the Gradle plugin ecosystem.

### I can’t upgrade. Is there anything I can do? [#](#i-cant-upgrade-is-there-anything-i-can-do)

We’re requiring that everyone update to the latest version of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin. This version should work for anyone using Gradle 3.0 and above.

If you run into problems upgrading, please let us know with an [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new/choose).

### For more information [#](#for-more-information)

On January 11th 2023, we were contacted by [MinecraftOnline](https://minecraftonline.com/) about two unusual and suspicious Gradle wrapper JARs found in some of their repositories. The wrappers were updated by a new contributor to MinecraftOnline.

We’ve performed an analysis of the JARs and will describe our findings below. We have determined that one exploit was especially crafted as an attack against the MinecraftOnline project.

If you are not interested in all of the details, jump immediately to our [companion blog](/project-integrity) covering how to protect your project or you, as a developer, against similar attacks.

## Analysis

Our analysis started by confirming that the SHA256 checksums for both JARs did not match any of the [known good Gradle Wrapper checksums](https://gradle.org/release-checksums/):

Our recent [security report](/wrapper-attack-report) shows that [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack) targeting the build process through the Gradle Wrapper exist in the wild. This blog post explains how to protect your project or you, as a developer, against similar attacks.

A build process, by design, executes code. The components of the build process all carry their own risks:

1. The bootstrapping script to run the build tool could be compromised. (see [How to ensure Gradle wrapper integrity?](#how-to-ensure-gradle-wrapper-integrity))
2. The build tool itself could be compromised. (see [How to ensure Gradle distribution integrity?](#how-to-ensure-gradle-distribution-integrity))
3. The build tool could download third-party dependencies that are themselves compromised. (see [How to ensure third party dependencies’ integrity?](#how-to-ensure-third-party-dependencies-integrity))
4. Malicious code could be hidden in the project code,...

On 16th August 2022, Gradle Plugin Portal and the Gradle Discourse forums were impacted by a security incident that could have led to exposure of the personal data of some Gradle community members.

No other services, hosted on [gradle.org](https://gradle.org), [gradle.com](https://gradle.com), or elsewhere were impacted.

# What happened?

An Amazon Web Services key granting access to database backups that contained personal information for a subset of the Gradle Plugin Portal and Discourse forum users was exposed in a Git commit. This key was exposed for two hours before being revoked.

We believe it is unlikely that the exposure led to an unauthorized access of data, but we are taking actions and notifying impacted individuals out of caution and transparency.

A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability has been identified in the popular Apache Log4j logging library that affects versions 2.0 up to and including 2.14.1. This vulnerability has affected a very large number of JVM-based systems. For more information on the vulnerability itself, see [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).

**Update (December 22, 2021)**: Since the first post, two other vulnerabilities have been identified - [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046) and [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) - so make sure to go over the different sections for updated instructions.

This vulnerability is being actively exploited. All Gradle users should assess whether their software projects are vulnerable and, if necessary, update to [Log4j 2.17.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.17.0) or newer as soon as possible. We have [provided instructions below](#protecting) on how to identify and...

## Important update when publishing plugins to the Plugin Portal

A security vulnerability was reported to us on March 4th, 2020. This problem could allow an authorized person to overwrite plugin artifacts on the Plugin Portal if they had access to the build logs that published the plugin. After a thorough investigation, we found no artifacts were overwritten for a malicious purpose.

In response, we’ve published a new version of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin that contains an update to mitigate this security vulnerability.

Please upgrade [`com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish) to version `0.11.0`. Old versions of the `com.gradle.plugin-publish` plugin will **no longer work**. If you do not publish plugins to the [Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/), you do not...

We are proud to announce the release of the new [Gradle Wrapper Validation GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gradle-wrapper-validation).

## Gradle Wrapper in Open Source

The [`gradle-wrapper.jar`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) is a binary blob of executable code that is checked into nearly [2.8 Million GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/search?l=&q=filename%3Agradle-wrapper.jar&type=Code).

Searching across GitHub you can find many pull requests (PRs) with helpful titles like ‘Update to Gradle xxx’. Many of these PRs are contributed by individuals outside of the organization maintaining the project.

Maintainers are grateful for these kinds of contributions as it takes an item off of their backlog. But there are security implications of accepting changes to the Gradle Wrapper...

Starting in January 2020, **Gradle services will only serve requests made with HTTPS**. From that point on, all requests made with HTTP will be denied and any builds and artifact mirrors that use a Gradle URL with the non-secure HTTP protocol will fail.

If you are proxying our services through your own artifact servers like Artifactory or Nexus, you will need to ensure that you update your mirror configurations so they are using HTTPS instead of HTTP.

## Gradle Services

This change will impact the following services.

### Plugin Portal

By default, the Gradle build tool uses HTTPS when resolving plugins from the Plugin Portal. You should be unaffected if you do not [declare a custom plugin repository](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugin_management).

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

[CVE-2020-7599  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7599) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-532  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.gradle.plugin-publish:com.gradle.plugin-publish.gradle.plugin` to version 0.11.0 or higher.

## Overview

[com.gradle.plugin-publish:com.gradle.plugin-publish.gradle.plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish) is a plugin that publishes plugins to the Gradle Plugin Portal.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes a Gradle plugin while running Gradle with the `--info` log level flag, the Gradle Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL. If this build log is publicly visible (as it is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI) this AWS pre-signed URL would allow a malicious actor to replace a recently uploaded plugin with their own. Malicious plugins can be potentially used to perform large scale supply chain attacks.

An example of this sensitive data leakage can be found here:
<https://travis-ci.org/nebula-plugins/nebula-kotlin-plugin/jobs/657945740#L660-L668>

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, but the attack is limited *at the protocol level* to a logically adjacent topology.

  **Adjacent**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
