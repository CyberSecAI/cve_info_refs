{
  "CVE-2020-7039": {
    "Description": "tcp_emu in tcp_subr.c in libslirp 4.1.0, as used in QEMU 4.2.0, mismanages memory, as demonstrated by IRC DCC commands in EMU_IRC. This can cause a heap-based buffer overflow or other out-of-bounds access which can lead to a DoS or potential execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Mismanagement of memory in slirp library's tcp_emu function",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) or potential arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
       "Local"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to send crafted IRC DCC commands to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect calculation of buffer size when using snprintf, as well as usage of 'm->m_size' instead of M_FREEROOM(m) leading to OOB access during emulation of IRC commands. Several vendors also point to incorrect handling of memory when reassembling incoming packets, if the first fragment is bigger than the m->m_dat[] buffer."
