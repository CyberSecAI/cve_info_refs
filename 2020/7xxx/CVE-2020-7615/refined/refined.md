  "CVE-2020-7615": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The fsa package is vulnerable to command injection. The first argument of `execGitCommand()`, located within `lib/rep.js#63`, can be controlled by users without any sanitization to inject arbitrary commands.",
    "details": "The vulnerability arises because the `execGitCommand` function in `rep.js` does not sanitize user-controlled input before passing it to the `child_process.exec` function. Specifically, the `command` argument to `execGitCommand` is directly used in the command that is executed. An attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands by manipulating this argument.",
    "affected_components": [
      "fsa npm package",
      "`execGitCommand()` function in `lib/rep.js`"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input in the `command` parameter passed to `execGitCommand` function, which is then passed to `child_process.exec` without sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server by injecting malicious code into the `command` parameter of the `execGitCommand` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "By controlling the `command` parameter passed to the vulnerable function `execGitCommand`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input of the `command` parameter in the `execGitCommand` function, which could be through various means depending on how this function is used in the application."
