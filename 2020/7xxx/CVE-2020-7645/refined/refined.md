Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7645

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `chrome-launcher` package. Specifically, the library does not properly sanitize the `$HOME` environment variable when used in Linux environments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the operating system by manipulating the `$HOME` environment variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable application.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** As a result of arbitrary code execution, an attacker could potentially achieve full control of the system leading to total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes the ability to read any file, modify any file and cause the system to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Environment Variable Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `$HOME` environment variable on Linux systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over the `$HOME` environment variable:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the value of the `$HOME` environment variable when the `chrome-launcher` library is used.
- **No Prior Authentication/Access Needed:** The attacker does not require any prior access to the system; the vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication or user interaction.
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is categorized as "Network" meaning the vulnerability can be exploited from a network and by attackers that are not local to the host.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:**  The vulnerability affects `chrome-launcher` versions prior to 0.13.2.
- **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC demonstrates how manipulating the `$HOME` variable leads to code execution, creating a `malicious_file` in this example.
- **CVSS Scores:** Snyk gives it an 8.1 (High) severity rating while the NVD gives a 9.8 (Critical) severity rating.
- **Fix:** The suggested fix is to upgrade `chrome-launcher` to version 0.13.2 or higher.
