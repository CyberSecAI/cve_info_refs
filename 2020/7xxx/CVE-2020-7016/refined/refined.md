Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7016:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw in the Timelion feature of Kibana.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The Timelion component in Kibana is vulnerable to a ReDoS attack. This happens because an attacker can craft a malicious URL that exploits inefficient regular expression processing within Timelion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit will cause the Kibana process to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to the Kibana instance becoming unresponsive. This impacts the availability of Kibana to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL containing a specific regular expression pattern that, when processed by Timelion, triggers the DoS condition.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim user needs to access the malicious URL within the Kibana application for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to construct a malicious URL.
*   **Ability to trick a user into accessing the malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to persuade a Kibana user to open the malicious link. This could potentially be done by phishing, social engineering, or embedding the link within a website viewed by the user.
