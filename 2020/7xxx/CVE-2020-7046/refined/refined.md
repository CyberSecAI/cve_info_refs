Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `lib-smtp` library in Dovecot does not properly handle truncated command parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The software fails to validate the command parameters in SMTP commands which leads to an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the `submission-login` and `lmtp` processes to enter an infinite loop, consuming 100% CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
- CPU resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted SMTP commands with truncated UTF-8 encoded parameters via `submission-login` and `lmtp`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit `submission-login`.
- The attacker needs to be able to send SMTP commands to the affected services.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Dovecot version 2.3.9.3.
- The vulnerability affects `submission-login` (where unauthenticated users can trigger it) and `lmtp`.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (CVSS3.1:AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
- The vulnerability is related to Improper Input Validation (CWE-30).
