Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `lazysizes` library's video-embed plugin's unsafe usage of `innerHTML`. Specifically, it fails to sanitize the `data-vimeo`, `data-vimeoparams`, `data-youtube`, and `data-ytparams` attributes before using them to construct and inject HTML into the page, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of user-controlled data (the aforementioned attributes) before using them to modify the DOM via `innerHTML`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The video-embed plugin does not properly validate or sanitize the attributes `data-vimeo`, `data-vimeoparams`, `data-youtube`, and `data-ytparams`. It only checks for valid characters but doesn't prevent malicious HTML or script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, in the context of the vulnerable website.
*   **Potential for Account Hijacking:** Through XSS, attackers can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. This could lead to account hijacking or impersonation of the user.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or phishing pages.
*   **Defacement of the Website:** Attackers can modify the content of the website, potentially leading to reputational damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTML Injection:** By controlling the `data-vimeo`, `data-vimeoparams`, `data-youtube`, or `data-ytparams` attributes, an attacker can inject malicious HTML, which will be executed when the video-embed plugin processes the element.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must interact with the vulnerable element (e.g., click on it) to trigger the injection process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to influence HTML attributes:** An attacker must be able to control or manipulate the `data-vimeo`, `data-vimeoparams`, `data-youtube`, or `data-ytparams` attributes of an element on a web page where the vulnerable `lazysizes` library is used. This can be achieved through various methods, including:
    *   Directly manipulating the HTML source if they have write access to the web page.
    *   Exploiting another vulnerability that allows for the injection of HTML.
    *   Convincing a user to copy and paste malicious HTML that uses these attributes.
*   **Knowledge of `lazysizes` and Video Embed Plugin:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the video embed plugin and how it processes the aforementioned attributes.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided proof of concept code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by injecting malicious javascript via the `data-ytparams` attribute.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involved more strict validation of the id and parameters used in the video embed plugin.
*   The Snyk vulnerability database entry states that the exploit has a proof of concept, confirming the easiness to exploit this issue.
