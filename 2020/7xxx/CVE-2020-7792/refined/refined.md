{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `deepFillIn` and `deepMixIn` functions in the mout library recursively merge objects without checking the keys used to access the target object, making them vulnerable to prototype pollution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Unsafe recursive object merge"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects, leading to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, tampering with application source code to force code path injection, or property injection to achieve admin privileges or access sensitive data.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype` attributes of objects.",
        "Providing a crafted object with a `__proto__` property that is then processed by the vulnerable `deepFillIn` or `deepMixIn` functions."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the input to either `deepFillIn` or `deepMixIn` functions.  This can occur if the library is used to parse untrusted data or if the attacker can influence the parameters passed to these functions.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited on application servers, web servers, and web browsers.  The vulnerable functions are in the `deepFillIn.js` and `deepMixIn.js` files within the mout library.  The fix involves upgrading the library to version 1.2.3 or higher, or applying mitigation techniques such as freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`, requiring schema validation of JSON input, or avoiding the use of unsafe recursive merge functions."
