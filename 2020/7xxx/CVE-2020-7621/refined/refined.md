Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `strong-nginx-controller` package. Specifically, the first argument of the `_nginxCmd()` function is directly controllable by users without any sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system through this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in the construction of a system command. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the first argument passed to the `_nginxCmd()` function, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where `strong-nginx-controller` is running. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities including data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
- **System Takeover:** Depending on the privileges of the user running the `strong-nginx-controller` process, the attacker could potentially gain complete control of the system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: The CVSS scores indicate a high impact on confidentiality, low impact on integrity and no impact on availability. However, the ability to execute commands on the server can easily lead to integrity and availability issues as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Directly via `_nginxCmd()`:** An attacker can directly call the `_nginxCmd()` function with a malicious command as its first argument. This is achievable by controlling the `action` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the input to the `_nginxCmd()` function in the `strong-nginx-controller`.
- They would need to be able to call this function with malicious input, which suggests either direct access to the application or the ability to influence the input via an API or other means.
- No privileges are required, as this is a vulnerability in the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The Snyk vulnerability report provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) illustrating how the vulnerability can be exploited. This PoC uses the `touch` command to demonstrate the execution of an arbitrary command on the server.
- The Snyk report includes a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium), while NVD gives a score of 9.8 (Critical) which is higher.
- There is no fixed version for the `strong-nginx-controller` package.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-7621 describes a command injection vulnerability in the `strong-nginx-controller` npm package due to insufficient sanitization of input to the `_nginxCmd()` function. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to system compromise.
