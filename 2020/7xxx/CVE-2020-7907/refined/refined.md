The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-7907.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Scala plugin was resolving artifact dependencies over unencrypted connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of unencrypted HTTP connections for retrieving dependencies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attackers could potentially intercept and modify the dependencies being downloaded.
- Could lead to supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into the project through compromised dependencies.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack where an attacker intercepts the communication between the IDE and the dependency repository.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the IDE and the repository.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform MitM attacks, meaning they have to be capable of intercepting and modifying network traffic.
