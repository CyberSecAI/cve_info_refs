{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `setter` function in `property-expr` allows setting properties on the prototype of objects by using a path containing `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects, leading to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or tamper with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, potentially leading to remote code execution or property injection.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a crafted path string to the `setter` function, an attacker can modify the prototype of JavaScript objects."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` argument provided to the `setter` function of the `property-expr` library."
