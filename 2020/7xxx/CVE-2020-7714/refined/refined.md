Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `set` function within the `confucious` npm package, which allows for Prototype Pollution. This happens because the `set` function can be manipulated to inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects by using `__proto__` in the key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting properties through the `__proto__` attribute using the vulnerable `set` function.
- **Unsafe Property Definition:** The `set` function allows for defining properties on an object based on a provided path. An attacker can set the path to `__proto__.myValue`, leading to the assignment of `myValue` to the prototype of the object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions that lead to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates specific object attributes and executes them (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can potentially inject and execute malicious code.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject properties that the application relies on, such as security-related properties like isAdmin flags, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who can control the input to the `confucious.set()` function.
- **Network:** The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the vulnerable `set` function, specifically the path parameter.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction, as they can manipulate the application by providing malicious input data.

**Additional details:**
- The provided material includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The Snyk report also provides preventative measures, such as:
    - Freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
    - Validating JSON inputs.
    - Avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions.
    - Using objects without prototypes such as `Object.create(null)`.
    - Using `Map` instead of `Object`.
- There is no fixed version for `confucious` listed in the report.
- Snyk assigned a severity rating of 7.5 (high), while the NVD gave it 9.8 (critical).
