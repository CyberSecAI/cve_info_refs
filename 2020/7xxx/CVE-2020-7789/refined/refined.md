Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `node-notifier` package is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of `options` parameters when passed as an array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input (in this case, parameters passed to the `node-notifier` function), allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Linux machine where the vulnerable `node-notifier` package is used. This could lead to:
  - Confidentiality breach: Access to sensitive data.
  - Integrity compromise: Modification of data or system configurations.
  - Availability issues: Denial of service or disruption of system functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by providing an array as the `options` parameter to the `node-notifier` function.
- The attack is performed on Linux systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authorization or access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious payload to the vulnerable application.

**Affected Versions:**
- `node-notifier` versions: <5.4.5, >=8.0.0 <8.0.2, >=9.0.0 <9.0.1
- `org.webjars.npm:node-notifier` versions: <5.4.5

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade `node-notifier` to version 5.4.5, 8.0.2, 9.0.1 or higher, or `org.webjars.npm:node-notifier` to version 5.4.5 or higher.
