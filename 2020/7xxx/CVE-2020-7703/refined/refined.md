Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue that arises due to the `setValue` function in the `nis-utils` package. This function allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, specifically by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects. By setting a property on `__proto__`, an attacker can affect all objects inheriting from that prototype.
- **Unsafe Property Definition:** The `setValue` function allows setting values based on a given path, which can be manipulated by an attacker to target the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties used implicitly by JavaScript operations (e.g., `toString`, `valueOf`), an attacker can cause the application to fail, leading to DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates an object's attribute and executes it (e.g., using `eval`), polluting the prototype with attacker-controlled code can lead to RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify existing properties that the application relies on (e.g., `isAdmin`), potentially leading to privilege escalation or other malicious behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `setValue` function of the `nis-utils` package.
- An attacker can control the "path" parameter of this function to inject properties onto the prototype.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to inject the `polluted` property via `__proto__.polluted`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the vulnerable `setValue` function to inject the malicious path targeting the prototype.
- No specific user interaction is required; the vulnerability can be exploited without user action.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-1321.
- The provided CVSS score is 7.5 (High) from Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) from NVD.
- The vulnerability can lead to a total loss of availability (High impact).
- The exploit is considered of low complexity with no required privileges.
- There is no fixed version for `nis-utils`.
