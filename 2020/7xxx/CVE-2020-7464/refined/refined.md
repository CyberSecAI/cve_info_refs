- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A programming error in the `ure(4)` device driver caused some Realtek USB Ethernet interfaces to incorrectly report packets larger than 2048 bytes as having a length of only 2048 bytes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The driver misinterprets the payload of large packets, leading to the injection of packets. Specifically, data beyond the 2048-byte boundary of a large packet is misinterpreted as a separate packet.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary packets that the host will receive and process, including spoofing packets from other hosts or injecting packets into other VLANs. This allows bypassing of security boundaries, such as VLANs.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be able to send large frames (larger than 2048 bytes) to be received by the host. This could involve sending large VLAN-tagged or untagged packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject large frames into a network that the vulnerable host is connected to. This could be achieved by being on the same VLAN or through other network access.
