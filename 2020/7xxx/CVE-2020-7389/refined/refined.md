```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'System' function, when used with the 'CHAINE' variable in some web application scripts within the Sage X3 developer environment, allows the execution of arbitrary commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306): Lack of proper authentication checks when using the 'System' function with the 'CHAINE' variable within the development environment."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands as the \"x3run\" user. This includes executing commands from a remote SMB share, potentially leading to further compromise of the system and/or the network.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a web application interface accessible through the menu prompts *Development -> Script dictionary -> Scripts*. The attacker must have access to this interface and be authenticated.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Sage X3, with access to the development functionality. The attacker also needs the ability to reach the affected web application interface."
