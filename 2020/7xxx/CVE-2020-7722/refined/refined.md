Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Prototype Pollution

**Root Cause:** The `deepSet` function within the `nodee-utils` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution. This occurs because the function allows setting values on an object using a path, and when the path includes `__proto__`, it can modify the prototype of the base Object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Unsafe property definition by path: The `deepSet` function allows an attacker to control the path and inject properties onto the `Object.prototype` by using `__proto__` in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values for functions like `toString` or `valueOf`, attackers can cause exceptions and disrupt application functionality.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the codebase evaluates properties of an object (e.g., using `eval`), attackers can inject malicious code by setting an attacker-controlled value to `Object.prototype`.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties the application relies on, such as privilege flags, leading to privilege escalation or other unintended behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   By controlling the "path" parameter in the `deepSet` function. This can be achieved if user-provided data is used to define the "path".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the vulnerable `deepSet` function, specifically the `path` parameter.
*   No prior authentication or access is required for this attack.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network since it's a component bound to the network stack.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Package:** `nodee-utils` versions prior to 1.2.3.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** The provided code snippet demonstrates how to pollute the prototype.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade `nodee-utils` to version 1.2.3 or higher.
*   **Prevention:**
    *   Freeze the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
    *   Implement schema validation for JSON input.
    *   Avoid unsafe recursive merge functions.
    *   Use objects without prototypes (`Object.create(null)`).
    *   Use `Map` instead of `Object`.
