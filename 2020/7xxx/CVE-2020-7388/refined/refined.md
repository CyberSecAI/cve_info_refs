Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7388:

**CVE-2020-7388: Sage X3 Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE) as SYSTEM in AdxDSrv.exe component**

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in the AdxDSrv.exe service, part of the AdxAdmin component of Sage X3. This service, used for remote administration, fails to properly validate authentication sequences allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Command Execution Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands without providing valid credentials by sending a modified authentication sequence.
    *   **Insufficient Authentication Checks:** The AdxDSrv.exe service does not properly validate user credentials, allowing a modified request to bypass authentication.
    *   **SYSTEM Level Execution:** Exploiting the vulnerability leads to command execution with the privileges of the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" user.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  **Full System Control:** An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands, allowing them to create administrator-level users, install malicious software, and take complete control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Exposure:** The AdxDSrv.exe service listens on TCP port 1818 (default) and is exposed over the network.
    *   **Custom Protocol Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted packets that manipulate the expected authentication sequence of the custom protocol used by Sage X3 Console to communicate with the AdxDSrv.exe service.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable Sage X3 instance.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Protocol:**  The attacker must be able to craft specific network requests according to the modified protocol requirements to trigger the authentication bypass and execute commands.
    *   **Installation Path Disclosure (Optional):** The attacker can obtain the installation directory using CVE-2020-7387 to help write the .cmd file to the server, but this can also be achieved using prior knowledge, or educated guesswork.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The standard authentication sequence starts with the byte `0x6a`. By changing this byte to `0x06`, the service ignores user credentials and executes commands under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context.
*   **Command Execution:** After authentication (or bypass), the attacker specifies a temporary directory and a filename, then writes the command to a batch file (.cmd) within the directory. The service then executes the batch file using the Windows API function `CreateProcessAsUserA`.
* **Patch Information:** The vulnerability was fixed in AdxAdmin version 93.2.53, which is common to X3 V9, V11, and V12, and ships with Syracuse 9.22.7.2, 11.25.2.6, and 12.10.2.8, respectively.

This detailed explanation clarifies how the vulnerability works, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
