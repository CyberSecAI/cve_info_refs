{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of the `DefaultObjectWrapper` class within JFrog Artifactory when processing Freemarker templates. This class allows access to Java objects in the template scope, permitting the execution of sensitive Java functions. The application uses Freemarker templates to process resources that have been uploaded and marked as 'filtered'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Freemarker template execution",
      "Use of `DefaultObjectWrapper` which allows access to Java objects"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker can read and write arbitrary files on the Artifactory server's file system. The attacker can potentially compromise the server by overwriting sensitive files (e.g., `.ssh/authorized_keys`).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload a malicious Freemarker template.",
      "Deploy the uploaded template.",
      "Mark the deployed artifact as a 'filtered resource'.",
      "Send a request to the processed artifact to trigger the template execution."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of JFrog Artifactory with the ability to upload and deploy artifacts.",
    "additional_details": "The attacker leverages the security object exposed by Artifactory to gain access to URI and URL objects that allow reading of files. Additionally, using Tomcat's Catalina servlet container, attackers can create File objects and manipulate files by utilizing the `renameTo()` method."
