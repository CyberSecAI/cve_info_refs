Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `doc-path` library's insecure handling of property paths when setting values on an object. Specifically, the library allows an attacker to control the 'path' parameter, which can be manipulated to inject properties onto the `Object.prototype` using the `__proto__` attribute. This is a classic case of prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, which allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, affecting all objects inheriting from that prototype.
*   **Insecure Property Setting:** The `setPath` function in versions prior to 2.3.0 does not adequately sanitize the input path, allowing the use of `__proto__` and `constructor` to modify the base object prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g., changing `toString` to an integer), attackers can trigger JavaScript exceptions, causing the application to fail and leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates specific attributes of an object and executes them (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), attackers can inject malicious code into the prototype, leading to RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value including security-related properties, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side:** The vulnerability is primarily exploited by manipulating the client-side by controlling the `keyPath` variable passed to the `setPath` function.
*   **Network:** As the vulnerability is in a network-bound component, the attack vector is network based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over `keyPath`:** Attackers need control over the path parameter passed to the `setPath` function in order to specify `__proto__` or `constructor` within it.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No user interaction:** This vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Additional details:**

* The Snyk vulnerability database entry for this CVE is SNYK-JS-DOCPATH-1011952.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.3.0 by adding a check for `__proto__` and `constructor` at the beginning of the `setPath` function, preventing modification of the prototype.
* The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High) by Snyk, and 9.8 (Critical) by NVD. Snyk has flagged the availability impact as "High," while the NVD has marked the severity as "Critical".
* The provided code snippet (PoC) demonstrates how the `__proto__` is used to inject the polluted property in vulnerable versions.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-7772 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `doc-path` npm package, which allows attackers to manipulate object prototypes by setting values using a malicious path. This can lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.3.0 of the package, highlighting the importance of keeping dependencies up to date.
