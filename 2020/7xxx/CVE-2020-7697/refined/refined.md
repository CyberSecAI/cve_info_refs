Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7697

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `mock2easy` package. Specifically, user-controlled data passed through the `_data` variable is used in a command execution context without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The application takes the `_data.interfaceUrl`, `query`, `_data.cookie`, and `_data.interfaceType` variables from user input and directly passes these to a function (`getJsonByCurl`) that executes a system command (likely using `curl`). This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through these parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the application.
- **Total Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates a critical impact:
    - **Confidentiality (High):**  Attackers can access all resources, potentially stealing sensitive information.
    - **Integrity (High):**  Attackers can modify any file on the system.
    - **Availability (High):** Attackers can completely deny access to resources.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network. The vulnerable component is exposed on the network, making it accessible to remote attackers, including those on the internet.
- The specific vulnerable code area involves the `getJsonByCurl` function, which receives unsanitized data through the `_data` variable, leading to the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the vulnerable system.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**
- The Snyk advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical), which aligns with the severity of the impact.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the `mock2easy` package. There is no fixed version available.
- The vulnerable code snippet is provided, highlighting how the `_data` variable is used in the `getJsonByCurl` function.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server via the `_data` variable, leading to severe consequences such as data breaches, system modification, and denial of service. The vulnerability is considered critical due to the ease of exploitation and severe impact.
