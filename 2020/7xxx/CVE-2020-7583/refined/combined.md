PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Automation License Manager (ALM) centrally manages license keys for various Siemens software
products. Software products requiring license keys automatically report this requirement to the ALM.
When the ALM ﬁnds a valid license key for this software, the software can be used in conformity with the
end user license agreement.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7583

The application does not properly validate the users’ privileges when executing some operations,
which could allow a user with low permissions to arbitrary modify ﬁles that should be protected against
writing.
