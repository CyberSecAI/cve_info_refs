Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Automation License Manager (ALM) application does not properly validate user privileges when executing certain operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The application fails to enforce proper authorization checks, allowing users with low permissions to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:**  A local user with low privileges can escalate their privileges to modify files that should be protected against writing. This could allow an attacker to potentially compromise the system by overwriting or manipulating critical files related to software licenses or other system functionalities.
- **Modification of Protected Files:**  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary modification of files that should be protected, which can lead to system instability or unauthorized access.
- **Integrity Impact:** The successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a high impact on data integrity

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with low privileges on a system running a vulnerable version of the Automation License Manager.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Automation License Manager 5 (all versions) and Automation License Manager 6 (all versions prior to V6.0.8).
- Siemens recommends updating to V6.0.8 or later for ALM 6 and suggests workarounds for ALM 5 due to the lack of available fixes. Workaround involves disabling access to drives containing licenses for non-admin users.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C.
