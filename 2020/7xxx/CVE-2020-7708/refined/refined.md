{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes by manipulating attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution: The `set`, `unSet`, `pushVal` and `pullVal` functions in the `@irrelon/path` library are vulnerable to prototype pollution. By controlling the `path` argument, an attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype`."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to:\n\n    *   Denial of service (DoS) by triggering JavaScript exceptions. For example, by polluting `Object.prototype.toString` with a non-string value, any operation relying on the `toString` method will fail.\n    *   Remote Code Execution in cases where the codebase evaluates an object's attribute and executes it, for example using `eval(someobject.someattr)`.\n    *   Property injection by polluting properties used for informative or security purposes, such as `isAdmin` to gain admin privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `path` argument in the `set`, `unSet`, `pushVal`, and `pullVal` functions to inject properties into the prototype of objects.",
       "The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and is remotely exploitable, which can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level*."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` argument passed to the vulnerable functions within the `@irrelon/path` library. This requires no prior authentication or user interaction."
  },
  "fix": "Upgrade `@irrelon/path` to version 4.7.0 or higher. This version introduces checks to prevent setting or unsetting properties on the `__proto__` object.",
    "cve": "CVE-2020-7708"
