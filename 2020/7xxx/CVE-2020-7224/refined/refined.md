Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Aviatrix OpenVPN client allowing the alteration of OpenSSL parameters from their intended values. This modification enables the potential loading of unauthorized third-party libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or restriction on OpenSSL parameters within the Aviatrix OpenVPN client. This allows for the injection or modification of these parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to load and execute unauthorized third-party libraries. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the client system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating or altering OpenSSL parameters within the Aviatrix OpenVPN client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need a way to influence or control the OpenSSL parameters used by the Aviatrix OpenVPN client. This could potentially be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack or by gaining control of the client machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify OpenVPN client configuration or parameters, or otherwise inject malicious parameters.

**Affected Products:**
- Aviatrix OpenVPN client versions 2.5.7 and older on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
