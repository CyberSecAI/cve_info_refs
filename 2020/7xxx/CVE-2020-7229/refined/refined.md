Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `countSearchedJobs()` function within the `_lib/class.Job.php` file of Simplejobscript.com SJS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `landing_location`, which is used in a query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP request to the `/searched` endpoint.
- Specifically, the attacker can manipulate the `landing_location` parameter in the HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting Simplejobscript.com SJS.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`landing_location`) and inject malicious SQL code.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) using `sqlmap`, demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `countSearchedJobs()` function within the `_lib/class.Job.php` file.
- The content also shows the payload used: `landing_title=aaa&landing_location=77+or+(select+(sleep(2)))`, which attempts to cause a delay via `sleep(2)` as a basic form of testing the injection.
- The vulnerable version is before 1.65, specifically tested on 1.64.
