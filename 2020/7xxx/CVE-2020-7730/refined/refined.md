Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7730:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of `cp.exec` to execute the zip command in the `bestzip` package. This method directly passes the user-provided input to the shell, making it vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs a shell command using user-provided `options.source` and `options.destination` without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable application. This could lead to data theft, system modification, denial of service, or complete control over the affected machine.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Exploiting the vulnerability could result in high impacts on all three:
    - **Confidentiality (High):**  All resources within the impacted component could be divulged to the attacker, allowing access to restricted information.
    - **Integrity (High):**  The attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component.
    - **Availability (High):** The attacker is able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through user-controlled input passed to the `options` parameter.
- The attack is remotely exploitable over a network because the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the `options` parameter of the `bestzip` function.
- No prior authentication or privileges are required. The attacker can be an unauthorized user.
- No user interaction is needed to execute the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involves replacing `cp.exec` with `cp.spawn`. `cp.spawn` avoids invoking a shell and takes command arguments as a list which prevents command injection by design.
- The fix also introduces a function named `expandSources` that parses the source files which prevents command injection issues.
- The fix is available in version 2.1.7 and higher of the `bestzip` package.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nathan Friedly
- Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical) for this vulnerability.
