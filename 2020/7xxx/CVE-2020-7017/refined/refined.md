Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the region map visualization in Kibana.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the region map visualization.
- HTML injection vulnerability, even when Content Security Policy (CSP) is configured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can create or edit a region map visualization can inject malicious code.
- This injected code can be executed within the context of a Kibana user's browser session when the user views the compromised visualization.
- Possible outcomes of successful exploitation include:
  - Obtaining sensitive information.
  - Performing destructive actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must be able to edit or create region map visualizations in Kibana.
- The malicious code is embedded within the visualization itself.
- The attack is triggered when a Kibana user views the compromised visualization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to create or edit visualizations in Kibana. This typically means having a role with some level of write access within Kibana.
- Once the attacker has created the malicious visualization, no further interaction is required to execute the attack. Any victim user that views the visualization is susceptible.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability impacts all versions of Kibana prior to 7.8.1 and 6.8.11
- The vulnerability is fixed in Kibana versions 7.8.1 and 6.8.11
- As a workaround, the 'xpack.maps.enabled', 'region_map.enabled', and 'tile_map.enabled' settings in `kibana.yml` can be used to disable the map visualizations.
- While a Content Security Policy (CSP) can prevent the execution of XSS, it does not address the underlying HTML injection vulnerability.
