Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7649:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `snyk-broker` package when handling file paths, which allows for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The application fails to adequately validate file paths, allowing attackers to use "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and variations to access files and directories outside of the intended scope. This vulnerability falls under CWE-22.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive files on the server, such as application source code, configuration files, and other critical system files.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain information about the folder structure and read the contents of sensitive files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send requests to the affected component.
- **Manipulation of URL Path:** The attacker manipulates the URL path by including directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable `snyk-broker` is running.
- **Privileged access:** The attacker requires privileges that provide significant control over the vulnerable component.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `snyk-broker` prior to 4.73.0.
- The fix involves rejecting paths that contain directory traversal sequences by normalizing the request URL using `path.normalize()`.
- Snyk has published a security advisory and a fix, upgrading `snyk-broker` to version 4.73.0 or higher resolves this issue.
- Snyk recommends upgrading to version 4.80.0 or higher, as it contains other security fixes and improvements.
