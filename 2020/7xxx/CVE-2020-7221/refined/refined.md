Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7221:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `mysql_install_db` script in MariaDB versions 10.4.7 through 10.4.11 (and prior to the fix in 10.4.12) unconditionally changed the ownership and permissions of the `auth_pam_tool_dir` directory and the `auth_pam_tool` binary. Specifically, it set the directory ownership to the mysql user and the binary to root with the setuid bit, even if they were already set correctly or maliciously modified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure Permissions Handling:** The `mysql_install_db` script blindly sets permissions for the `auth_pam_tool_dir` and `auth_pam_tool`, creating a vulnerability where an attacker controlling the mysql user can exploit this process.
- **Unconditional Execution:** The script executes the permission changes regardless of the existing state.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation:** If a mysql user is compromised, an attacker can place a malicious binary within `auth_pam_tool_dir/auth_pam_tool`. When `mysql_install_db` is run, the malicious binary gains setuid-root privileges, allowing the attacker to achieve full root access.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Symlink Attack:** An attacker could potentially use symlinks within the `auth_pam_tool_dir` directory to target other files for permission changes when `mysql_install_db` runs.
- **Malicious Binary Replacement:** The attacker could replace the legitimate `auth_pam_tool` binary with a malicious one.
- **Direct Manipulation:** Since the directory is owned by the `mysql` user, an attacker could directly create or modify files within `auth_pam_tool_dir` if they have gained access to the mysql user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Compromised MySQL User:** The attacker needs to have control of the `mysql` user account on the target system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the server where MariaDB is installed.
- **Ability to trigger `mysql_install_db`:**  The attacker needs to either wait for the automated execution of the script (during package installation or service start) or be able to manually trigger the execution of the `mysql_install_db` script.

**Additional notes from the provided content:**

- The fix introduced in MariaDB 10.4.12 attempts to mitigate the issue by skipping the vulnerable chown/chmod commands if the `--rpm` command line parameter is used. However, the vulnerability still exists when `mysql_install_db` is run without this parameter, as could happen when an administrator runs it manually.
- The recommended fix is to set the directory ownership to root:mysql and the directory mode to 0750.
- The `mysql_install_db` script behavior is dangerous by default and a patch was proposed to warn the user if permissions are incorrect instead of automatically setting them.
- The issue was fixed in SUSE products by not shipping the vulnerable `mysql_install_db` script and setting the correct permissions via the package manager instead.
- The setuid binary itself was not shipped initially in SUSE products, so SUSE was not initially vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of the `auth_pam_tool` binary.
