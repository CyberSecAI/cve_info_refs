{
  "CVE-2020-7356": {
    "Description": "CAYIN xPost suffers from an unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability. Input passed via the GET parameter 'wayfinder_seqid' in wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and execute SYSTEM commands.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'wayfinder_seqid' parameter within the wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp page.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary SQL code injection, leading to potential execution of system commands with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp` page, injecting malicious SQL code via the `wayfinder_seqid` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No authentication is needed. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
