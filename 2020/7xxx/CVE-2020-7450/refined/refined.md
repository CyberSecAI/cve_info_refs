- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A programming error in libfetch allows an attacker to overflow buffers by specifying a URL with username and/or password components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libfetch.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who controls the URL being fetched can trigger a heap buffer overflow, leading to program misbehavior or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must be able to specify the URL that libfetch will process. This could occur through HTTP redirects, or by directly providing the malicious URL to a vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to control the URL processed by libfetch, this could be achieved through methods like HTTP redirects. The attacker does not need to be local.
