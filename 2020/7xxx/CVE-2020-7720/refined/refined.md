  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-7720",
    "description": "The `util.setPath` function in the `node-forge` library, versions prior to 0.10.0, has a potential prototype pollution vulnerability. This function can be exploited using unsafe input to cause prototype pollution. This vulnerability is triggered when the attacker has control over the `path` parameter of the `util.setPath` function.",
    "root_cause": "The `util.setPath` function allows setting values on an object using a path string. When the path string includes `__proto__`, the function can modify the prototype of `Object`, leading to prototype pollution.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "Prototype pollution can lead to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, tampering with the application's source code to force specific code paths, or property injection allowing to modify sensitive properties like isAdmin resulting in privilege escalation or remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a crafted path string containing `__proto__` to the `util.setPath` function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `path` parameter provided to the `util.setPath` function."
  }
