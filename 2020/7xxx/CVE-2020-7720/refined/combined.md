# Forge ChangeLog

## 1.3.1 - 2022-03-29

### Fixes

* RFC 3447 and RFC 8017 allow for optional `DigestAlgorithm` `NULL` parameters
  for `sha*` algorithms and require `NULL` paramters for `md2` and `md5`
  algorithms.

## 1.3.0 - 2022-03-17

### Security

* Three RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification issues were reported by Moosa
  Yahyazadeh (moosa-yahyazadeh@uiowa.edu).
* **HIGH**: Leniency in checking `digestAlgorithm` structure can lead to
  signature forgery.
  + The code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can
    allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked
    portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low
    public exponent is being used. For more information, please see
    ["Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery based on implementation
    error"](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/)
    by Hal Finney.
  + CVE ID: [CVE-2022-24771](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24771)
  + GHSA ID: [GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765)
* **HIGH**: Failing to check tailing garbage bytes can lead to signature
  forgery.
  + The code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a
    `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed
    and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is
    being used. For more information, please see ["Bleichenbacher's RSA
    signature forgery based on implementation
    error"](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/)
    by Hal Finney.
  + CVE ID: [CVE-2022-24772](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24772)
  + GHSA ID: [GHSA-x4jg-mjrx-434g](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-x4jg-mjrx-434g)
* **MEDIUM**: Leniency in checking type octet.
  + `DigestInfo` is not properly checked for proper ASN.1 structure. This can
    lead to successful verification with signatures that contain invalid
    structures but a valid digest.
  + CVE ID: [CVE-2022-24773](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24773)
  + GHSA ID: [GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-2r2c-g63r-vccr)

### Fixed

* [asn1] Add fallback to pretty print invalid UTF8 data.
* [asn1] `fromDer` is now more strict and will default to ensuring all input
  bytes are parsed or throw an error. A new option `parseAllBytes` can disable
  this behavior.
  + **NOTE**: The previous behavior is being changed since it can lead to
    security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible that code doing custom
    DER parsing may need to adapt to this new behavior and optional flag.
* [rsa] Add and use a validator to check for proper structure of parsed ASN.1
  `RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5` `DigestInfo` data. Additionally check that the hash
  algorithm identifier is a known value from RFC 8017
  `PKCS1-v1-5DigestAlgorithms`. An invalid `DigestInfo` or algorithm identifier
  will now throw an error.
  + **NOTE**: The previous lenient behavior is being changed to be more strict
    since it could lead to security issues with crafted inputs. It is possible
    that code may have to handle the errors from these stricter checks.

### Added

* [oid] Added missing RFC 8017 PKCS1-v1-5DigestAlgorithms algorithm
  identifiers:
  + `1.2.840.113549.2.2` / `md2`
  + `2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.4` / `sha224`
  + `2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.5` / `sha512-224`
  + `2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.6` / `sha512-256`

## 1.2.1 - 2022-01-11

### Fixed

* [tests]: Load entire module to improve top-level testing and coverage
  reporting.
* [log]: Refactor logging setup to avoid use of `URLSearchParams`.

## 1.2.0 - 2022-01-07

### Fixed

* [x509] 'Expected' and 'Actual' issuers were backwards in verification failure
  message.

### Added

* [oid,x509]: Added OID `1.3.14.3.2.29 / sha1WithRSASignature` for sha1 with
  RSA. Considered a deprecated equivalent to `1.2.840.113549.1.1.5 / sha1WithRSAEncryption`. See [discussion and
  links](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/issues/825).

### Changed

* [x509]: Reduce duplicate code. Add helper function to create a signature
  digest given an signature algorithm OID. Add helper function to verify
  signatures.

## 1.1.0 - 2022-01-06

### Fixed

* [x509]: Correctly compute certificate issuer and subject hashes to match
  behavior of openssl.
* [pem]: Accept certificate requests with "NEW" in the label. "BEGIN NEW
  CERTIFICATE REQUEST" handled as "BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST".

## 1.0.0 - 2022-01-04

### Notes

* **1.0.0**!
* This project is over a decade old! Time for a 1.0.0 release.
* The URL related changes may expose bugs in some of the networking related
  code (unrelated to the much wider used cryptography code). The automated and
  manual test coverage for this code is weak at best. Issues or patches to
  update the code or tests would be appreciated.

### Removed

* **SECURITY**, **BREAKING**: Remove `forge.debug` API. The API has the
  potential for prototype pollution. This API was only briefly used by the
  maintainers for internal project debug purposes and was never intended to be
  used with untrusted user inputs. This API was not documented or advertised
  and is being removed rather than fixed.
* **SECURITY**, **BREAKING**: Remove `forge.util.parseUrl()` (and
  `forge.http.parseUrl` alias) and use the [WHATWG URL
  Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/). `URL` is supported by modern browers
  and modern Node.js. This change is needed to address URL parsing security
  issues. If `forge.util.parseUrl()` is used directly or through `forge.xhr` or
  `forge.http` APIs, and support is needed for environments without `URL`
  support, then a polyfill must be used.
* **BREAKING**: Remove `forge.task` API. This API was never used, documented,
  or advertised by the maintainers. If anyone was using this API and wishes to
  continue development it in other project, please let the maintainers know.
  Due to use in the test suite, a modified version is located in
  `tests/support/`.
* **BREAKING**: Remove `forge.util.makeLink`, `forge.util.makeRequest`,
  `forge.util.parseFragment`, `forge.util.getQueryVariables`. Replace with
  `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, and custom code as needed.

### Changed

* **BREAKING**: Increase supported Node.js version to 6.13.0 for URL support.
* **BREAKING**: Renamed `master` branch to `main`.
* **BREAKING**: Release process updated to use tooling that prefixes versions
  with `v`. Other tools, scripts, or scanners may need to adapt.
* **BREAKING**: Remove docs related to Bower and
  [forge-dist](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge-dist). Install using
  [another method](/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/README.md#installation).

### Added

* OIDs for `surname`, `title`, and `givenName`.

### Fixed

* **BREAKING**: OID 2.5.4.5 name fixed from `serialName` to `serialNumber`.
  Depending on how applications used this id to name association it could cause
  compatibility issues.

## 0.10.0 - 2020-09-01

### Changed

* **BREAKING**: Node.js 4 no longer supported. The code *may* still work, and
  non-invasive patches to keep it working will be considered. However, more
  modern tools no longer support old Node.js versions making testing difficult.

### Removed

* **BREAKING**: Remove `util.getPath`, `util.setPath`, and `util.deletePath`.
  `util.setPath` had a potential prototype pollution security issue when used
  with unsafe inputs. These functions are not used by `forge` itself. They date
  from an early time when `forge` was targeted at providing general helper
  functions. The library direction changed to be more focused on cryptography.
  Many other excellent libraries are more suitable for general utilities. If
  you need a replacement for these functions, consider `get`, `set`, and `unset`
  from [lodash](https://lodash.com/). But also consider the potential similar
  security issues with those APIs.

## 0.9.2 - 2020-09-01

### Changed

* Added `util.setPath` security note to function docs and to README.

### Notes

* **SECURITY**: The `util.setPath` function has the potential to cause
  prototype pollution if used with unsafe input.
  + This function is **not** used internally by `forge`.
  + The rest of the library is unaffected by this issue.
  + **Do not** use unsafe input with this function.
  + Usage with known input should function as expected. (Including input
    intentionally using potentially problematic keys.)
  + No code changes will be made to address this issue in 0.9.x. The current
    behavior *could* be considered a feature rather than a security issue.
    0.10.0 will be released that removes `util.getPath` and `util.setPath`.
    Consider `get` and `set` from [lodash](https://lodash.com/) if you need
    replacements. But also consider the potential similar security issues with
    those APIs.

## 0.9.0 - 2019-09-04

### Added

* Add ed25519.publicKeyFromAsn1 and ed25519.privateKeyFromAsn1 APIs.
* A few OIDs used in EV certs.

### Fixed

* Improve ed25519 NativeBuffer check.

## 0.8.5 - 2019-06-18

### Fixed

* Remove use of `const`.

## 0.8.4 - 2019-05-22

### Changed

* Replace all instances of Node.js `new Buffer` with `Buffer.from` and `Buffer.alloc`.

## 0.8.3 - 2019-05-15

### Fixed

* Use basic character set for code.

## 0.8.2 - 2019-03-18

### Fixed

* Fix tag calculation when continuing an AES-GCM block.

### Changed

* Switch to eslint.

## 0.8.1 - 2019-02-23

### Fixed

* Fix off-by-1 bug with kem random generation.

## 0.8.0 - 2019-01-31

### Fixed

* Handle creation of certificates with `notBefore` and `notAfter` dates less
  than Jan 1, 1950 or greater than or equal to Jan 1, 2050.

### Added

* Add OID 2.5.4.13 "description".
* Add OID 2.16.840.1.113730.1.13 "nsComment".
  + Also handle extension when creating a certificate.
* `pki.verifyCertificateChain`:
  + Add `validityCheckDate` option to allow checking the certificate validity
    period against an arbitrary `Date` or `null` for no check at all. The
    current date is used by default.
* `tls.createConnection`:
  + Add `verifyOptions` option that passes through to
    `pki.verifyCertificateChain`. Can be used for the above `validityCheckDate`
    option.

### Changed

* Support WebCrypto API in web workers.
* `rsa.generateKeyPair`:
  + Use `crypto.generateKeyPair`/`crypto.generateKeyPairSync` on Node.js if
    available (10.12.0+) and not in pure JS mode.
  + Use JS fallback in `rsa.generateKeyPair` if `prng` option specified since
    this isn't supported by current native APIs.
  + Only run key generation comparison tests if keys will be deterministic.
* PhantomJS is deprecated, now using Headless Chrome with Karma.
* **Note**: Using Headless Chrome vs PhantomJS may cause newer JS features to
  slip into releases without proper support for older runtimes and browsers.
  Please report such issues and they will be addressed.
* `pki.verifyCertificateChain`:
  + Signature changed to `(caStore, chain, options)`. Older `(caStore, chain, verify)` signature is still supported. New style is to to pass in a
    `verify` option.

## 0.7.6 - 2018-08-14

### Added

* Test on Node.js 10.x.
* Support for PKCS#7 detached signatures.

### Changed

* Improve webpack/browser detection.

## 0.7.5 - 2018-03-30

### Fixed

* Remove use of `const`.

## 0.7.4 - 2018-03-07

### Fixed

* Potential regex denial of service in form.js.

### Added

* Support for ED25519.
* Support for baseN/base58.

## 0.7.3 - 2018-03-05

### Added

* Support verification of SHA-384 certificates.
* `1.2.840.10040.4.3'`/`dsa-with-sha1` OID.

### Fixed

* Support importing PKCS#7 data with no certificates. RFC 2315 sec 9.1 states
  certificates are optional.
* `asn1.equals` loop bug.
* Fortuna implementation bugs.

## 0.7.1 - 2017-03-27

### Fixed

* Fix digestLength for hashes based on SHA-512.

## 0.7.0 - 2017-02-07

### Fixed

* Updated tests, examples, docs.
* Updated dependencies.
* Updated flash build system.
* Improve OID mapping code.
* Change test servers from Python to JavaScript.
* Improve PhantomJS support.
* Move Bower/bundle support to
  [forge-dist](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge-dist).
* **BREAKING**: Require minimal digest algorithm dependencies from individual
  modules.
* Enforce currently supported bit param values for byte buffer access. May be
  **BREAKING** for code that depended on unspecified and/or incorrect behavior.
* Improve `asn1.prettyPrint()` BIT STRING display.

### Added

* webpack bundler support via `npm run build`:
  + Builds `.js`, `.min.js`, and basic sourcemaps.
  + Basic build: `forge.js`.

* Add IRC to "Contact" section of README.
* Add "Security Considerations" section to README.
* Add pbkdf2 usePureJavaScript test.
* Add rsa.generateKeyPair async and usePureJavaScript tests.
* Add .editorconfig support.
* Add `md.all.js` which includes all digest algorithms.
* Add asn1 `equals()` and `copy()`.
* Add asn1 `validate()` capture options for BIT STRING contents and value.

### Removed

* **BREAKING**: Can no longer call `forge({...})` to create new instances.
* Remove a large amount of old cruft.

### Migration from 0.6.x to 0.7.x

* (all) If you used the feature to create a new forge instance with new
  configuration options you will need to rework your code. That ability has
  been removed due to implementation complexity. The main rare use was to set
  the option to use pure JavaScript. That is now available as a library global
  flag `forge.options.usePureJavaScript`.
* (npm,bower) If you used the default main file there is little to nothing to
  change.
* (npm) If you accessed a sub-resource like `forge/js/pki` you should either
  switch to just using the main `forge` and access `forge.pki` or update to
  `forge/lib/pki`.
* (bower) If you used a sub-resource like `forge/js/pki` you should switch to
  just using `forge` and access `forge.pki`. The bower release bundles
  everything in one minified file.
* (bower) A configured workerScript like
  `/bower_components/forge/js/prime.worker.js` will need to change to
  `/bower_components/forge/dist/prime.worker.min.js`.
* (all) If you used the networking support or flash socket support, you will
  need to use a custom build and/or adjust where files are loaded from. This
  functionality is not included in the bower distribution by default and is
  also now in a different directory.
* (all) The library should now directly support building custom bundles with
  webpack, browserify, or similar.
* (all) If building a custom bundle ensure the correct dependencies are
  included. In particular, note there is now a `md.all.js` file to include all
  digest algorithms. Individual files limit what they include by default to
  allow smaller custom builds. For instance, `pbdkf2.js` has a `sha1` default
  but does not include any algorithm files by default. This allows the
  possibility to include only `sha256` without the overhead of `sha1` and
  `sha512`.

### Notes

* This major update requires updating the version to 0.7.x. The existing
  work-in-progress "0.7.x" branch will be painfully rebased on top of this new
  0.7.x and moved forward to 0.8.x or later as needed.
* 0.7.x is a start of simplifying forge based on common issues and what has
  appeared to be the most common usage. Please file issues with feedback if the
  changes are problematic for your use cases.

## 0.6.x - 2016 and earlier

* See Git commit log or <https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge>.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `node-forge` to version 0.10.0 or higher.

## Overview

[node-forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) is a JavaScript implementations of network transports, cryptography, ciphers, PKI, message digests, and various utilities.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the `util.setPath` function.

**Note: version 0.10.0 is a breaking change removing the vulnerable functions.**

### POC:

```
const nodeforge = require('node-forge');
var obj = {};
nodeforge.util.setPath(obj, ['__proto__', 'polluted'], true);
console.log(polluted);

```
## Details

Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.

There are two main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:

* Unsafe `Object` recursive merge
* Property definition by path

### Unsafe Object recursive merge

The logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following high-level model:

```
merge (target, source)

foreach property of source

```
if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source

  merge(target[property], source[property])

else

  target[property] = source[property]

```

```

When the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property exists and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the merge recurses with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the source of `Object` as defined by the attacker. Properties are then copied on the `Object` prototype.

Clone operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges, which occur when a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object: `merge({},source)`.

`lodash` and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive merge attacks.

### Property definition by path

There are a few JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property values on an object based on a given path. The function that is generally affected contains this signature: `theFunction(object, path, value)`

If the attacker can control the value of “path”, they can set this value to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.

## Types of attacks

There are a few methods by which Prototype Pollution can be manipulated:

| Type | Origin | Short description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Denial of service (DoS)** | Client | This is the most likely attack. DoS occurs when `Object` holds generic functions that are implicitly called for various operations (for example, `toString` and `valueOf`).  The attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` and alters its state to an unexpected value such as `Int` or `Object`. In this case, the code fails and is likely to cause a denial of service. **For example:** if an attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.toString` by defining it as an integer, if the codebase at any point was reliant on `someobject.toString()` it would fail. |
| **Remote Code Execution** | Client | Remote code execution is generally only possible in cases where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object, and then executes that evaluation.**For example:** `eval(someobject.someattr)`. In this case, if the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.someattr` they are likely to be able to leverage this in order to execute code. |
| **Property Injection** | Client | The attacker pollutes properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens. **For example:** if a codebase checks privileges for `someuser.isAdmin`, then when the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype.isAdmin` and sets it to equal `true`, they can then achieve admin privileges. |

## Affected environments

The following environments are susceptible to a Prototype Pollution attack:

* Application server
* Web server
* Web browser
## How to prevent

1. Freeze the prototype— use `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.
2. Require schema validation of JSON input.
3. Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
4. Consider using objects without prototypes (for example, `Object.create(null)`), breaking the prototype chain and preventing pollution.
5. As a best practice use `Map` instead of `Object`.
