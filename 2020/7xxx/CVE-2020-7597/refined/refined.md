Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `codecov` npm package.
- The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `gcov-root`, `gcov-exec`, and `gcov-args` options, which are used in the `exec` function within `lib/codecov.js`.
- Specifically, the fix for CVE-2020-7596 was incomplete, leaving a residual vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs a shell command using user-provided input (options: `gcov-root`, `gcov-exec`, `gcov-args`) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The provided `sanitizeVar` function only removes the `&` character, which is not enough to prevent command injection as other shell metacharacters can still be used. The `validator.escape` function was also not properly used to prevent injection as it is only used in non-windows environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system where the `codecov` package is used.
- **Confidentiality Impact:**  The attacker can potentially access sensitive information on the compromised system if the executed command has that capability, leading to a high confidentiality impact.
- **Integrity Impact:** The attacker can modify system files and settings if the executed command has that capability.  In this specific vulnerability, the integrity impact is considered none, but in a different context, it could be very high.
- **Availability Impact:** An attacker can cause denial of service, if the executed command has that capability. In this specific vulnerability, the availability impact is considered none, but in a different context, it could be very high.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `gcov-root`, `gcov-exec`, or `gcov-args` options when calling the `codecov` package, which are then used in the command execution.
- An attacker could supply malicious strings through these options, for example, by using the proof of concept provided `& touch exploit &` for the `gcov-root` option, to execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the parameters provided to the `codecov` package.
- According to the CVSS vector, the attack is network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely.
- The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:L).
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N).
- The attacker needs basic user capabilities to affect settings and files or have access to non-sensitive resources.

**Additional Details:**

- The Snyk advisory mentions that this vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-7596, meaning that a previous attempt to fix this type of issue was not comprehensive enough.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how the `gcov-root` argument can be used to inject and execute a `touch` command to create a file named `exploit`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the `codecov` package prior to 3.6.5.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-7597 is a command injection vulnerability in the `codecov` npm package. By providing specially crafted values to the `gcov-root`, `gcov-exec`, and `gcov-args` options, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the application with the vulnerable package installed. This vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of these inputs prior to executing them as part of a shell command.
