Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7634

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `heroku-addonpool` npm package. The second parameter of the exported function `HerokuAddonPool(id, app, opt)` is not sanitized and can be controlled by the user. This user-controlled input is then used in a `child_process.exec` call, resulting in command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application executes arbitrary commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization. This is a classic example of CWE-74, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection').

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the environment and the attacker's goals. The CVSS score from NVD is 9.8 (critical) indicating a severe impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying malicious input to the second parameter of the `HerokuAddonPool` function when it is called from an application. Specifically, this input is used unsanitized in a command execution. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable as the vulnerable component is part of a node application that could be exposed to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the second argument (`app`) passed to the `HerokuAddonPool` function. This might be through control of configuration files, API calls, or other input points to the vulnerable node application using this library. No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `heroku-addonpool` versions prior to `0.1.16`.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited by passing a command as the application name in the `HerokuAddonPool` function call.
- Snyk's analysis gives a CVSS score of 6.5 (medium), while the NVD assessment gave a higher score of 9.8 (critical). This discrepancy could be due to differences in scoring methodologies or threat modeling.
- The vulnerability was discovered by JHU System Security Lab.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade the `heroku-addonpool` package to version 0.1.16 or higher.
