  "CVE-2020-7060": {
    "Description": "When using certain mbstring functions to convert multibyte encodings, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.27, 7.3.x below 7.3.14 and 7.4.x below 7.4.2 it is possible to supply data that will cause function mbfl_filt_conv_big5_wchar to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.",
    "Root cause": "An incorrect check in the `mbfl_filt_conv_big5_wchar` function allows out-of-bounds reads in the `cp950_pua_tbl` global variable when converting multibyte encodings, specifically when the provided character code falls within a certain range.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure and/or crash due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
     "Specific crafted input to mbstring functions that causes out-of-bounds read"
   ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to supply data that will be processed by the vulnerable `mbfl_filt_conv_big5_wchar` function. No authentication is required."
  },
    "CVE-2020-7062": {
        "Description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when using file upload functionality, if upload progress tracking is enabled, but session.upload_progress.cleanup is set to 0 (disabled), and the file upload fails, the upload procedure would try to clean up data that does not exist and encounter null pointer dereference, which would likely lead to a crash.",
        "Root cause": "A null pointer dereference occurs when an upload cleanup procedure tries to clean up data that doesn't exist after a file upload failure, given specific configuration settings where upload progress tracking is enabled but cleanup is disabled.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Null pointer dereference",
            "Improper cleanup of resources"
        ],
        "Impact": "Likely leads to a crash (Denial of Service).",
         "Attack vectors": [
             "Network",
             "File upload functionality"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to initiate a file upload. The session.upload_progress.cleanup setting must be disabled. The file upload must fail."

     "CVE-2020-7063": {
        "Description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.28, 7.3.x below 7.3.15 and 7.4.x below 7.4.3, when creating PHAR archive using PharData::buildFromIterator() function, the files are added with default permissions (0666, or all access) even if the original files on the filesystem were with more restrictive permissions. This may result in files having more lax permissions than intended when such archive is extracted.",
       "Root cause": "The `PharData::buildFromIterator()` function does not preserve the original file permissions when adding files to a PHAR archive, instead assigning a default permission (0666).",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect file permission handling",
           "Information leakage"
        ],
        "Impact": "Files in the extracted PHAR archive will have less restrictive (more open) file permissions than originally intended.",
      "Attack vectors": [
           "Network",
           "Creation and extraction of PHAR archives"
         ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a PHAR archive with `PharData::buildFromIterator()` function. No authentication is required."

        "Description": "When using fgetss() function to read data with stripping tags, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.27, 7.3.x below 7.3.14 and 7.4.x below 7.4.2 it is possible to supply data that will cause this function to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.",
        "Root cause": "The `fgetss()` function, when stripping HTML tags, incorrectly handles certain crafted inputs, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
        "Weaknesses": [
