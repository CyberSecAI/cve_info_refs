{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-7694",
    "Root cause": "The request logger in uvicorn is vulnerable to ANSI escape sequence injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Log injection",
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in Output (CWE-117)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can:\n\n*   Pollute uvicorn's access logs, therefore jeopardizing the integrity of such files.\n*   Use ANSI sequence codes to attempt to interact with the terminal emulator that's displaying the logs (either in real time or from a file).",
    "Attack vectors": "By requesting crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component will log the URL after it's been processed with `urllib.parse.unquote`, therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminal emulators.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker can be anyone on the network. No prior authentication is required.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the logging mechanism processes URLs using `urllib.parse.unquote` before writing them into log files. This allows attackers to inject special characters, such as ANSI escape sequences, into log files, thereby potentially manipulating terminal output, or injecting fake entries into the log files."
