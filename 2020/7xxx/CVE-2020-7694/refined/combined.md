## How to fix?

Upgrade `uvicorn` to version 0.11.7 or higher.

## Overview

[uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) is a lightning-fast ASGI server.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Log Injection. The request logger provided by the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP request is received, the default behaviour of `uvicorn` is to log its details to either the console or a log file. When attackers request crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component will log the URL after it's been processed with `urllib.parse.unquote`, therefore converting any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent, which can have special meaning in terminal emulators.

By requesting URLs with crafted paths, attackers can:

* Pollute uvicorn's access logs, therefore jeopardising the integrity of such files.
* Use ANSI sequence codes to attempt to interact with the terminal emulator that's displaying the logs (either in real time or from a file).

### PoC

```
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    print(scope)
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.start',
        'status': 200,
        'headers': [
            [b'Content-Type', b'text/plain']
        ]
    })
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.body',
        'body': b'Hello, world!',
    })
`

curl -v '[http://localhost:9999/logfile-injection%20HTTP%2f1.1%22%20200%20OK%0d%0aINFO:%20%20%20%20%208.8.8.8:1337%20-%20%22POST%20/admin/fake-action&#39](http://localhost:9999/logfile-injection%20HTTP/1.1%22%20200%20OK%0D%0AINFO%3A%20%20%20%20%208.8.8.8%3A1337%20-%20%22POST%20/admin/fake-action%27);

The previous GET request added a fake entry to the log file, stating that the host at 8.8.8.8 made a POST request to /admin/fake-action.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

3.7 low

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

**Documentation**: <https://www.uvicorn.org>

Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python.

Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application interface for
async frameworks. The [ASGI specification](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) fills this gap, and means we're now able to
start building a common set of tooling usable across all async frameworks.

Uvicorn supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.

## Quickstart

Install using `pip`:

```
$ pip install uvicorn
```

This will install uvicorn with minimal (pure Python) dependencies.

```
$ pip install 'uvicorn[standard]'
```

This will install uvicorn with "Cython-based" dependencies (where possible) and other "optional extras".

In this context, "Cython-based" means the following:

* the event loop `uvloop` will be installed and used if possible.
* the http protocol will be handled by `httptools` if possible.

Moreover, "optional extras" means that:

* the websocket protocol will be handled by `websockets` (should you want to use `wsproto` you'd need to install it manually) if possible.
* the `--reload` flag in development mode will use `watchfiles`.
* windows users will have `colorama` installed for the colored logs.
* `python-dotenv` will be installed should you want to use the `--env-file` option.
* `PyYAML` will be installed to allow you to provide a `.yaml` file to `--log-config`, if desired.

Create an application, in `example.py`:

```
async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'

    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.start',
        'status': 200,
        'headers': [
            (b'content-type', b'text/plain'),
        ],
    })
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.body',
        'body': b'Hello, world!',
    })
```

Run the server:

```
$ uvicorn example:app
```

---

## Why ASGI?

Most well established Python Web frameworks started out as WSGI-based frameworks.

WSGI applications are a single, synchronous callable that takes a request and returns a response.
This doesn’t allow for long-lived connections, like you get with long-poll HTTP or WebSocket connections,
which WSGI doesn't support well.

Having an async concurrency model also allows for options such as lightweight background tasks,
and can be less of a limiting factor for endpoints that have long periods being blocked on network
I/O such as dealing with slow HTTP requests.

---

## Alternative ASGI servers

A strength of the ASGI protocol is that it decouples the server implementation
from the application framework. This allows for an ecosystem of interoperating
webservers and application frameworks.

### Daphne

The first ASGI server implementation, originally developed to power Django Channels, is [the Daphne webserver](https://github.com/django/daphne).

It is run widely in production, and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.

Any of the example applications given here can equally well be run using `daphne` instead.

```
$ pip install daphne
$ daphne app:App

```

### Hypercorn

[Hypercorn](https://github.com/pgjones/hypercorn) was initially part of the Quart web framework, before
being separated out into a standalone ASGI server.

Hypercorn supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets.

It also supports [the excellent `trio` async framework](https://trio.readthedocs.io), as an alternative to `asyncio`.

```
$ pip install hypercorn
$ hypercorn app:App

```

### Mangum

[Mangum](https://github.com/jordaneremieff/mangum) is an adapter for using ASGI applications with AWS Lambda & API Gateway.

### Granian

[Granian](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian) is an ASGI compatible Rust HTTP server which supports HTTP/2, TLS and WebSockets.

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
