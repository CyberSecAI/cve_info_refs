Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Codelogic Codoforum application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-Based XSS: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input that is used to generate dynamic content on the client side. This allows execution of malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- Lack of HttpOnly Flag: The session cookie was not set with the `HttpOnly` flag, making it accessible to JavaScript. This allowed the attacker to steal session cookies and take over accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Account Takeover: By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could steal session cookies of other users, including administrators, and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, leading to various malicious actions such as data theft, defacement, or further attacks on other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting JavaScript code within a new thread poll.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post new threads to a Codoforum instance, which seems to be available to regular authenticated users.
- The attacker needs to entice a victim to view a malicious thread.
