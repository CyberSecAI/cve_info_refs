Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7614:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `npm-programmatic` library's unsafe handling of user-supplied input when constructing shell commands. Specifically, the `packages` and `opts` properties are concatenated into a string without proper sanitization or validation before being passed to the `exec` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By injecting malicious code into the `packages` array or `opts` object, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the `npm-programmatic` code. This could lead to:
    -  Data breaches by accessing sensitive information.
    -  System compromise by installing malware, backdoors, or taking control of the server.
    -  Denial-of-service attacks by crashing the server or consuming excessive resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious shell commands using specially crafted values for the packages array or options object.
- **Direct use of exec:** The library uses `child_process.exec` directly, which takes a string and passes it to the shell without any sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input to the `npm-programmatic` library, such as providing malicious package names or options.
- The attacker needs to have some means to trigger the `install` or `uninstall` functions within the vulnerable `npm-programmatic` library
- Attack complexity is rated as high because the attacker needs to control the input to the vulnerable library in a specific way.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable code is located in `index.js`, where the `install` and `uninstall` functions build a command string by directly concatenating the user supplied `packages` array and `opts` properties.
- The proof of concept (PoC) provided by Snyk demonstrates how to inject a command into the `packages` array. In this case, the `attack_code` variable is crafted to create a `create.txt` file in the current working directory.

**Additional Details**
- Snyk has assigned a low severity score of 3.6 to this vulnerability while NVD gave a critical score of 9.8, due to the impact described above.
- There is no fixed version available for the `npm-programmatic` package.

In summary, CVE-2020-7614 is a command injection vulnerability in the `npm-programmatic` package, caused by the library's insecure construction of shell commands from unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
