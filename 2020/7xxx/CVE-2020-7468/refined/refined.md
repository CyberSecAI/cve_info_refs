- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in the implementation of the file system sandbox within `ftpd(8)` when using the `ftpchroot(5)` feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `ftpd(8)` implementation of the file system sandbox has a flaw that allows a malicious client to escape the restrictions imposed by `ftpchroot(5)`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escape the file system restrictions and gain root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated FTP user can exploit the vulnerability. Anonymous access is not sufficient.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid login to the FTP server. They also need to be able to leverage the vulnerable `ftpd(8)` implementation of `ftpchroot(5)`.
