Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `parsePath` function of the `pathval` library. Specifically, the library doesn't prevent the injection of properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects. This is achieved by not sanitizing  `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`  in the input `path`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By manipulating the `path` parameter in the `setPathValue` function, an attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of `Object`, affecting all JavaScript objects in the application.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition by Path:** The vulnerability arises due to the library's mechanism for defining property values based on a given path, where the path isn't sanitized to prevent access to `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting essential functions in the `Object.prototype` like `toString` or `valueOf` with unexpected values, the application can encounter errors, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates an object attribute using `eval`, an attacker could inject malicious code via the `Object.prototype` to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious or unauthorized properties into objects that the application relies on (e.g., setting `isAdmin` to `true`).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `setPathValue(obj, path, value)` function in the `pathval` library. The attacker controls the `path` parameter to inject properties into `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `path` parameter of `pathval.setPathValue()` function. If the application uses the library to parse and set values based on user-controlled inputs without validation, it is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `pathval` versions prior to 1.1.1.
*   Snyk provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability, making exploitation easier.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6 (Medium) according to Snyk.
*   The fix involves upgrading to `pathval` version 1.1.1 or higher. The fix introduces checks to prevent the use of `constructor`, `__proto__`, and `prototype` in the path.
