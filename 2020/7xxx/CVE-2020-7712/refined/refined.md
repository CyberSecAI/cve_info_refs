{
  "CVE-2020-7712": {
    "description": "The 'json' package, in versions prior to 10.0.0, is vulnerable to command injection via the parseLookup function due to the usage of 'eval'. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the 'eval' function within the 'parseLookup' function of the json package. This allowed the evaluation of arbitrary code provided as a lookup string.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to a range of potential consequences including unauthorized access, data breaches, or complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Local"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious payload to the vulnerable parseLookup function. A high level of privilege is required.",
