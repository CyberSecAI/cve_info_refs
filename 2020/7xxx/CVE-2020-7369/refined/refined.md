Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7369:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-7369 and includes it in a table listing affected browsers, confirming its relevance.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of URL display in the address bar of mobile browsers when specific actions are performed, primarily involving JavaScript manipulation of page loading and redirects, including the use of arbitrary ports and data schemes. This allows for the address bar to show a different URL than the actual content being displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is the lack of proper synchronization between the displayed URL in the address bar and the actual content being rendered by the browser. This occurs due to how JavaScript can manipulate the timing of page loads and redirects, making it possible to spoof the address bar. The specific vulnerabilities include:

-   Preserving the address bar of the URL when requested over an arbitrary port.
-   Using `setInterval` to rapidly reload a spoofed URL, preventing the user from noticing the redirection.
-   Using `window.open` with a spoofed URL and then quickly replacing its content, while the address bar maintains the original URL.
-   Using the data scheme followed by arbitrary URLs to preserve the URL.
-   Using base64 encoded content to display a fake page while the address bar shows a legitimate URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can successfully perform phishing attacks. By spoofing the address bar, the attacker can mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate site, tricking them into revealing credentials, downloading malware, or performing other malicious actions. This can lead to:

-   Credential theft
-   Malware distribution
-   Financial fraud

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through a malicious website controlled by the attacker that contains Javascript designed to exploit the address bar spoofing vulnerabilities. The user is tricked into visiting this website via:

- Phishing emails.
- Phishing text messages.
- Posts on popular forums or other public platforms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to host or inject JavaScript on a web page.
-   The attacker must be able to persuade the victim to visit the malicious website by using social engineering tactics.
- The attacker does not need any elevated permissions or special privileges on the victim's device.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability affects several mobile browsers, including but not limited to Safari, Opera Touch, UC Browser, Yandex Browser, Bolt Browser, and RITS Browser.
-   The blog post by Tod Beardsley from Rapid7 and the paper by Rafay Baloch provide a thorough overview of the technical details and impact.
-   Fixes for the vulnerability have been released by several vendors, including Apple, Opera, UCWeb and Yandex.

In summary, the content provides a detailed look at address bar spoofing vulnerabilities in mobile browsers, highlighting their technical causes, exploitation methods, impact, and mitigation steps.
