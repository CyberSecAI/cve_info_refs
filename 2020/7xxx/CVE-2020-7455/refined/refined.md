Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the FTP packet handler within the `libalias` library.
- The handler incorrectly calculates packet lengths.
- This incorrect calculation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:**  The primary vulnerability is a read past the end of an allocated buffer. This occurs due to the incorrect packet length calculation in the FTP packet handler of `libalias`.
- **Lack of Proper Validation:** The Zero Day Initiative advisory notes that the issue results from a "lack of proper validation of user-supplied data." This implies that the library is not adequately validating input related to packet lengths, which is then used in memory access operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory disclosure:** A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of small amounts of memory.
    - For in-kernel NAT implementations, this means leaking kernel memory.
    - For userspace NAT implementations (like `natd`), this means leaking memory from the process space of the `natd` process.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** The ZDI advisory mentions that this vulnerability could be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the kernel. This implies that while this vulnerability in itself might only leak memory, it could be a stepping stone for more severe exploits in a chain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
- **Specially crafted packets:** The attacker sends specifically crafted FTP packets designed to trigger the faulty length calculation, resulting in the out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to a system using `ipfw` with NAT enabled.
- **Local privilege (ZDI report):** The ZDI advisory indicates that, though network-based, this particular vulnerability might require authentication to reach the vulnerable code path. The advisory states, "Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. "
-   **Note:** The FreeBSD advisory doesn't explicitly mention this requirement. This difference may indicate a nuance of the in-kernel exploit path versus the `natd` userspace exploit path or that different preconditions apply to the information disclosure, versus the RCE that the ZDI advisory seems to allude to.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems using `ipfw` with NAT enabled. It does *not* affect systems using `ipfw` without NAT, or systems that use `pf(4)` or `ipf(4)` firewalls.
- The `libalias` library is used by both in-kernel and userspace NAT implementations in FreeBSD.

In summary, CVE-2020-7455 is a vulnerability in the `libalias` library that can be triggered by sending specially crafted FTP packets. This allows an attacker to read a small amount of memory, potentially leading to further exploitation, especially if combined with other vulnerabilities. The vulnerability is related to incorrect packet length calculations within the library's FTP packet handler.
