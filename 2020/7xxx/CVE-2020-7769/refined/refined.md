    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of recipient email addresses when using the sendmail transport.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary command flags into the sendmail command, potentially leading to information disclosure, modification of data, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious recipient email address containing sendmail command flags.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the recipient email address used by the application with the vulnerable nodemailer library."
