Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2020-7043 vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7043
*   **Description:** The vulnerability exists in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL before 1.0.2. The `tunnel.c` file mishandles certificate validation because hostname comparisons do not consider '\\0' characters. This can be exploited by an attacker using a crafted hostname such as `good.example.com\x00evil.example.com`.

*   **Root Cause:** The `strncasecmp()` function was used to compare the byte array against the expected hostname which does not correctly treat a Common Name (CN) that contains a NULL byte.
*   **Vulnerability:** TLS Certificate CommonName NULL Byte Vulnerability
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially bypass certificate validation by injecting a NULL byte into the Common Name (CN) of a certificate.
*   **Attack Vector:** A man-in-the-middle attacker could present a certificate with a Common Name containing a null byte, tricking the client into accepting a certificate for a different domain.
*   **Affected Component:** `tunnel.c`
*   **Affected Version:** openfortivpn 1.11.0 and earlier
*   **Fixed Version:** openfortivpn 1.12.0

The fix involved incorporating a reference implementation from iSECPartners to correctly handle hostname validation in the presence of NULL bytes within the certificate's Common Name. This likely involves using a function that properly checks for the end of the string instead of relying on `strncasecmp`.
