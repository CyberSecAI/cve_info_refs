# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

## [Snyk Broker Security Fixes](/snyk-broker-security-fixes-152338)

### Fix

We have introduced [several security fixes](https://github.com/snyk/broker/blob/master/SECURITY.md) to our open source Broker. We’d like to thank Wing Chan of The Hut Group that responsibly disclosed the issues to us via our bug bounty program.

These issues pertained to increased privileges available to specific internal Snyk Personnel only. All issues were patched for all supported SCMs in version 4.80.0 of the Broker. We also have taken steps to improve the auditability of the Broker code, and have also improved both client and server-side logging in order to improve customer and Snyk visibility of activity on the service.

[CVE-2020-7648  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7648) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-22  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `snyk-broker` to version 4.72.2 or higher.

## Overview

[snyk-broker](https://github.com/snyk/broker) is a package that proxies access between snyk.io and your Git repositories, such as GitHub Enterprise, GitHub.com and Bitbucket Server. Snyk Broker can also be used to enable a secure connection with your on-premise Jira deployment.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read. It allows arbitrary file reads for users who have access to Snyk's internal network by appending the URL with a fragment identifier and a whitelisted path e.g. `#package.json`

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

4.9 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide significant (e.g., administrative) control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.

  **High**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
