Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `snyk-broker` package that allows arbitrary file reads.
- By appending a fragment identifier and a whitelisted path to the URL, an attacker can read arbitrary files.
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization allowing path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The core vulnerability is the ability to read files from the server's filesystem that the `snyk-broker` has access to
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The vulnerability is caused by the ability to manipulate the requested path, which can lead to reading files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Loss:** Successful exploitation leads to a total loss of confidentiality, allowing an attacker to read sensitive files from the system. This may include configuration files, secrets, or other critical data.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The attacker requires high privileges to exploit the vulnerability, which may allow them to further compromise the system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is network-based, meaning it can be exploited remotely by anyone with access to the network where the vulnerable `snyk-broker` instance is running.
- The attack vector involves manipulating the URL to include a fragment identifier with a whitelisted path (e.g., `#package.json`) to access arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network where the vulnerable `snyk-broker` instance is running.
- **Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges, such as administrative control, on the vulnerable component to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `snyk-broker` versions **<4.72.2**.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `4.72.2` of the package.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Wing Chan of The Hut Group.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
