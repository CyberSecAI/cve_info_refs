```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `readFileFromContentBase` function in `rollup-plugin-server` lacks proper path sanitization when reading files, allowing directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially including sensitive information like source code, configuration files, and private keys.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending a crafted HTTP request with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences or absolute file paths in the URL, an attacker can access files outside the intended directory."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No authentication or special privileges are required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the `readFile` operation within the `readFileFromContentBase` function of the `rollup-plugin-server` package. The proof of concept demonstrates accessing a sensitive file located in the server's parent directory by using `../` in the URL. The provided CVSS score is 7.5 (High) with network attack vector, low complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope and high confidentiality impact."
