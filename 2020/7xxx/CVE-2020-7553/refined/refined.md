Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7553

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the parsing of CGF files, before copying it to a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The software fails to check the size of user-provided data before copying it to a heap buffer. This can cause a buffer overflow when the provided data is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious CGF file:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious CGF file that, when opened by the vulnerable application, triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Malicious page:** The advisory also mentions the target could be compromised through visiting a malicious page. This implies the application might parse CGF files through a browser or other web-based component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, as the target user must open a malicious CGF file or visit a malicious page.
*   **Remote access:** The vulnerability is described as allowing remote attackers to execute code.

**Additional Information:**
*   Schneider Electric has released an update to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-08-07, and the advisory was publicly released on 2021-02-01.
