Depending on how the URL is used by the application, this could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities. The specific impact would depend on the application and the context in which urllib3 is used.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could supply a crafted URL with invalid characters as input to the `parse_url` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a URL string to an application using the vulnerable `urllib3` version."
