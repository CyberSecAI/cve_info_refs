Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7719

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `php.strings.parse_str` function in the `locutus` JavaScript library is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This function parses a string as if it were a query string, and assigns the key-value pairs to an object. If the input string contains special property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`, these can be used to modify the prototype of the base JavaScript `Object`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript `Object` by injecting properties using specially crafted input strings to the vulnerable `parse_str` function.
- **Unsafe Object Property Assignment:** The `parse_str` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input keys, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the prototype with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to denial of service. For instance, overwriting the `toString` method of the `Object` prototype would cause errors when other code attempts to use `toString()` on any object.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain scenarios where the application evaluates properties from an object, like with `eval()`, a polluted prototype can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
- **Property Injection:**  Attackers can inject or modify properties that the application uses for security checks, like admin flags, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `php.strings.parse_str` function. By sending specially crafted query string-like data to the `parse_str` function, an attacker can inject properties into the prototype chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `parse_str` function. This could be through a query string parameter or any other user-controlled data that ends up being passed to the function.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the `parse_str` function does not sanitize or validate input keys when populating the target object. This allows attackers to introduce or modify properties on the `Object.prototype` using special keywords such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
  ```javascript
  const phpjs = require('phpjs');
  phpjs.parse_str("__proto__[polluted]=true",{});
  console.log(polluted);
  ```
  This code pollutes the prototype by adding the property `polluted` to `Object.prototype`, which then makes it accessible from the global scope.

**Fix:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by validating the input to check for the special prototype-related keywords (`__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`) and not modifying the target object if they exist in the input string. This effectively prevents prototype pollution. The fix was implemented in version 2.0.12 of the `locutus` library.

**Additional Information:**
- Snyk assigned the identifier `SNYK-JS-LOCUTUS-598675` to this vulnerability.
- The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-1321.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8.
