Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Puppet handles node catalogs when a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node.
*   A node with a valid certificate was previously entitled to all information in the system.
*   The system allowed for a malicious node to modify its facts, and retrieve the catalog for a different node that falls back to the default catalog.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system did not properly restrict access to node catalogs based on the node requesting the catalog. It relied on a certificate being valid to grant full access, not node identity.
*   **Fact Manipulation:** The system allowed facts to be modified, and those modified facts could be used to trigger a lookup for a different node's catalog.
*   **Default Node Fallback:** When a node's catalog cannot be determined, the system falls back to a 'default' node's catalog, which, in turn, causes the vulnerability to be exposed by the fact manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could retrieve the Puppet catalog of a different node.
*   This catalog contains sensitive configuration information, potentially exposing secrets, credentials, and other sensitive data.
*   The attacker could gain a broad understanding of the system's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs access to the Puppet infrastructure.
*   **Compromised Node:** The attacker must have control over a node in the Puppet infrastructure.
*   **Fact Modification:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the facts of the compromised node during a Puppet run.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid certificate to initially connect to the Puppet infrastructure and gain access as a valid node.
*   The attacker must be able to modify the facts associated with their node before it requests a catalog.
*   The attacker must be able to monitor network traffic or have access to the catalog content once retrieved.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in the Puppet master's `puppet.conf` file.
*   The fix was introduced in Puppet versions 6.13.0 and 5.5.19.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content explicitly mentions the fix and recommends that users not upgrading should also set `strict_hostname_checking` to `true`
*   The CVE description provides a more detailed explanation than the official description.
