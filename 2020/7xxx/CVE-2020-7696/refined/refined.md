Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-7696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTTP headers within the `react-native-fast-image` library on iOS. Specifically, when an image is loaded with custom headers (e.g., `authorization`, `host`), these headers are not properly scoped to the individual request. Instead, they are being stored and reused for all subsequent image loading requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:**  The primary vulnerability is the leaking of sensitive HTTP headers (e.g., authorization tokens, cookies) from one image request to subsequent image requests. This can lead to unintended exposure of credentials to different servers or services.
- **Incorrect Header Handling:** The library uses `SDWebImageDownloader` on iOS which manages global shared headers instead of the context option of the request modifier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Leakage:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive user data by exploiting the header leakage, specifically authorization or session tokens used for authenticating against a server.
- **Data Exposure:**  Other sensitive data within custom headers could also be exposed, leading to further vulnerabilities or unauthorized access to resources.
- **Application Instability:** The incorrect `host` header usage can cause requests to fail, leading to images not loading correctly and the application showing incorrect data or failing to render specific features.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Level:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, as the attacker needs to only control the URLs of the images that are being displayed using the `react-native-fast-image` component.
- **Application Level:** The application using `react-native-fast-image` becomes the attack vector by requesting images with headers, which are then leaked to subsequent requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Image URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to control the image URLs that an application using the vulnerable library will request.
- **No Privileged Access Required:** The attacker doesn't need access to the application's code or the server it's running on to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests, and the target application must be able to request the attacker controlled URLs.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is specific to the iOS implementation of `react-native-fast-image`.
- The issue was resolved in version 8.3.0 of the `react-native-fast-image` package.
- The fix involves using the context option of request modifier for SDWebImage to ensure headers are specific to each image request, and avoiding mutable copies of `NSURLRequest` which leads to a race condition.
- The vulnerability was reported by Andrei Alecu.
