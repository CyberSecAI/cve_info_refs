# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

#### Introduced: 12 Jun 2020

[CVE-2020-7696  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7696) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-255  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `react-native-fast-image` to version 8.3.0 or higher.

## Overview

[react-native-fast-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fast-image) is a FastImage, performant React Native image component.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure. When an image with `source={{uri: "...", headers: { host: "somehost.com", authorization: "..." }}` is loaded, all other subsequent images will use the same headers, this can lead to signing credentials or other session tokens being leaked to other servers.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

See detail issue description in [#690](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image/issues/690). See SDWebImage issue: [SDWebImage/SDWebImage#3031](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/issues/3031)

Close [#242](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image/issues/242)

Fix the implementation on iOS for per-image-request-header-setup. Should not use `SDWebImageDownloader` which manage the global shared headers.

Should Use the context option of request modifier. Or when concurrent request comes, the headers may mass up.

This MR also bump webp coder because the old version contains OOM issue.

| Extra changes:   1. Fix the issue of `data:image` for WebP images. Using SDWebImage's API can keep the external format support, including WebP/APNG/AVIF/HEIF. As well as iOS system default format. 2. Alaways bypass invalid SSL certificate error, same behavior like React-Native itself |

| After using native debug code, I found the following issue:   1. Your example URL `https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff`, use the `multipart/mixed` contents for image, which is not considered in currernt SDWebImage implementation. (Ususally image server return `image/jpeg` or something, not a multipart contents, just raw blob data).   But React-Native provide the implemenation, see: <https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.63-stable/React/Base/RCTMultipartDataTask.m#L101-L128>  So, which means, until we support the same code, you can not request the stream-style image server provider.   2. Your example URL `https://dummyimage.com/600x400/000/fff` which use a not-trusted SSL certificate. (You have wrong Let's Encrypt config?). Because of this, you will trigger the SSL authoriation error for SDWebImage. Use `SDWebImageDownloaderAllowInvalidSSLCertificates` can skip this validation.   But however, `react-native-fast-image` does not have anything customizable for this behavior. For temp workaround, I can hardcode this to always skip. |

| Busy working in daily job...  For the strange crash, I doubt there are something race condition for iOS native code to `mutable copy && copy the NSURLRequest`.  If I can reproduce the crash, maybe it's better to do not mutable copy and re-create a new NSURLRequest instead. I'll have a try and verify, if that can fix, I'll update the MR. |

| [@andreialecu](https://github.com/andreialecu) Confirmed the bug because of SDWebImage's usage.  The `NSURLRequest.HTTPMethod` should not use nil, should use `GET` for default value.  I'll provide a hotfix on SDWebImage for this.  This PR already apply the patch, and can be mereged now. You can have a try again with the latest branch commit. |

| [@dreampiggy](https://github.com/dreampiggy) awesome, I just tested it and it loads all images that were previously not loading, and headers are not leaking any more. ~~There's one minor concern about skipping invalid SSL certs, which I added a comment about.~~ (edit: this has been reverted, PR should be good to go) |

| [@DylanVann](https://github.com/DylanVann) I'm glad to see you back here for continue maintains.  This PR not only just used for logic fix, but also fix the security issue talked about by [#690](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image/issues/690). This means you leaks the HTTP headers like Cookie to other domain. |

| [@dreampiggy](https://github.com/dreampiggy) Thanks so much for implementing this. This was an aspect of SDWebImage that always frustrated me, great that it's fixed.  Note this MR also add the support for any external image format support for `base64://` on iOS. So maybe it's better to update the release changelog as well.  Previouslly, only the HTTP url can load WebP/AVIF/SVG/PDF, etc.  The iOS user just need to register the coder plugin following [SDWebImage's Coder Plugin](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage/wiki/Coder-Plugin-List), then all things done. |

## Description

![@andreialecu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/697707?u=091800d1b122350ab2f30677bc1b76a91dea1497&v=4&size=48)[andreialecu](https://github.com/andreialecu)opened [on Jun 5, 2020](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image/issues/690#issue-631464734)

**Describe the bug**

When an image with `source={{uri: "...", headers: { host: "somehost.com", authorization: "..." }}` is loaded, all other subsequent images will use the same headers.

This can lead to images not showing, because the `host` header is wrong, and web servers will return 404 errors for the request.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior if possible, or a link to a reproduction repo:

1. Go to <https://hookbin.com/> and create a new endpoint
2. Add an image with `source={{ uri: "hookbin endpoint #1", headers: { foo: "bar" } }}`.
3. Create another endpoint at hookbin
4. Add another image with `source={{ uri: "hookbin endpoint #2" }}`, ensure it loads after image 2.

The request for image on endpoint `#2` will include the `foo`: `bar` headers.

This is probably the reason of a lot of errors with images not properly showing in this repository.

**Additionally, this is a serious security issue, as signing credentials or other session tokens could be leaked to other servers. See screenshot below.**

**Expected behavior**

Headers should not be reused.

**Screenshots**

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/697707/83863179-aa406280-a72b-11ea-8fc6-c1c44218c3ac.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/697707/83863179-aa406280-a72b-11ea-8fc6-c1c44218c3ac.png)

Notice how headers are leaked to other servers. The headers were only supposed to be used for images from the s3 bucket, but they are attached to every request.

**Dependency versions**

* React Native version: 0.62.1
* React version: 16.11.0
* React Native Fast Image version: 8.1.5
