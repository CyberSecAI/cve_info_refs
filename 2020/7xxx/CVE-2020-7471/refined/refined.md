Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7471:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly addresses CVE-2020-7471. It's explicitly mentioned in the descriptions and commit messages, and the provided links lead to the official CVE record and related documentation.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `StringAgg(delimiter)` function within Django's PostgreSQL module. Specifically, the `delimiter` parameter wasn't properly escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the `delimiter` parameter of the `StringAgg` function.
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The code failed to properly escape or sanitize the delimiter string, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Some sources also mention the possibility of DoS.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability could lead to the addition, modification, or deletion of data in the database.
     *  **Information Disclosure** The vulnerability could potentially leak sensitive database information.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Some sources mention the potential for privilege escalation.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through the `StringAgg(delimiter)` function, used in Django applications that interact with PostgreSQL databases.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by providing a maliciously crafted `delimiter` parameter.
    *   User-supplied input passed to `StringAgg(delimiter)` makes the application vulnerable.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious string as the `delimiter` argument in a `StringAgg` function.
    *   The attacker requires knowledge of how the vulnerable `StringAgg` function is implemented.
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the `django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg` function which is part of Django's PostgreSQL specific aggregation functions.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the delimiter by passing it as an expression rather than directly as a string, thus preventing SQL injection.
*   Affected versions include Django 1.11 before 1.11.28, 2.2 before 2.2.10, and 3.0 before 3.0.3.
*   The fix uses Unicode Technical Report 36 for case-insensitive comparison of identifiers to prevent account hijacking during password reset requests.
