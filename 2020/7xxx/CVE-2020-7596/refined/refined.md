Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `codecov` npm package is vulnerable to command injection. Specifically, the `gcov-args` argument, which is user-controlled, is passed to the `exec` function within `lib/codecov.js` without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the `gcov-args` parameter, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Confidentiality Impact:** Exploitation can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information within the affected component.
- The provided proof of concept shows the ability to create arbitrary files, which could be used to exfiltrate data.
- Although not explicitly stated, successful command injection can potentially lead to further compromise of the system or network it is running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `gcov-args` argument, which can be manipulated to include malicious commands. The vulnerability is network-based, meaning the attacker could exploit it remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `gcov-args` parameter passed to the `codecov` package.
- The attacker requires low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `codecov` versions prior to 3.6.2.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the creation of an arbitrary file via `& touch PWNED &` injected into the `gcov-args` parameter.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).
