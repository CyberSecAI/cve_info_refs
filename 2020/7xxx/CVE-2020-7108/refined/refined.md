Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The LearnDash WordPress LMS plugin versions 3.0.0 through 3.1.1 were vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   The vulnerability exists because user input in the "Search Your Courses" field is not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session due to improper sanitization of user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   This allows attackers to:
    *   Steal session cookies or login credentials.
    *   Perform arbitrary actions on the victim's behalf.
    *   Log keystrokes.
    *   Potentially redirect the user to a malicious page or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the "Search Your Courses" input field within the LearnDash plugin.
*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this search field.
*   The XSS payload can be injected either directly through the search field, or by crafting a malicious URL containing the payload in the `ld-profile-search` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user views their LearnDash profile page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to target logged-in users of a WordPress website with the vulnerable LearnDash plugin installed.
*   The attacker can leverage crafted URLs (e.g., through social engineering) to target victims.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was reported to the LearnDash team on January 14, 2020, and a patched version (3.1.2) was released on the same day.
* The provided content includes proof of concept exploit code demonstrating the XSS vulnerability by using a simple `alert()` payload.
* The issue was identified by Jinson Varghese Behanan.
* The vulnerability is located in the ld_profile shortcode functionality.
