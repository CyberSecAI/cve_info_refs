Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `macfromip` npm package. The `getMacInLinux` and `getMacInWin32` functions, located in lines 66 and 96 of `macfromip.js` respectively, are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs operating system commands using external input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the IP address provided as input is not properly sanitized before being used in a shell command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application using this package.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  As a consequence of arbitrary command execution, attackers can gain full control over the system potentially leading to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes reading or modifying any data, and complete disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is exposed through the network stack, making it potentially exploitable over the internet.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious code through the IP address parameter passed to the vulnerable functions in the macfromip library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need any specific system access.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable server through the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject commands using specially crafted IP addresses within the getMacInLinux and getMacInWin32 functions
*   **No Fix Available:** There is no fixed version of the `macfromip` package to address this vulnerability.

In summary, the `macfromip` npm package is vulnerable to command injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code with potentially severe consequences. The vulnerability is easily exploitable over the network, requiring no special attacker privileges or user interaction.
