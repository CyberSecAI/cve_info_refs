Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7764

**Root Cause:**
The `find-my-way` package, by default, accepts the `Accept-Version` header. If versioned routes are not configured, this header is still processed, allowing an attacker to manipulate the cache by using it as an unkeyed header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Web Cache Poisoning:** The vulnerability stems from the application's acceptance of the `Accept-Version` header even when versioning isn't explicitly used. This allows an attacker to influence the cached content by sending requests with manipulated `Accept-Version` headers.
- **Unkeyed Header:** The `Accept-Version` header is treated as an unkeyed header, meaning that the cache might store responses based on the value of this header, even if the application does not use it for route selection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by manipulating the cache to serve incorrect or invalid content, thereby disrupting service availability. The vulnerability could lead to a total loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending crafted requests with arbitrary `Accept-Version` header values, attackers can poison the cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server or any intermediary cache.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The `find-my-way` package versions `<2.2.5` and `>=3.0.0 <3.0.5` are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.2.5, 3.0.5 and higher by disabling the `Accept-Version` header processing by default and only enabling it when versioned routes are configured.
- The fix also suggests adding a `Vary` header with `Accept-Version` value to responses when versioning is in use, this helps preventing cache poisoning attacks.

**CVSS Score:**
- Snyk: 5.9 (Medium)
- NVD: 7.5 (High)
