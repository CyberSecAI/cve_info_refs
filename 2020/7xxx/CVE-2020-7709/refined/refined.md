Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `json-pointer` library handles property setting using a path. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the provided path, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects using special property names like `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to prototype pollution. By controlling the "path" parameter in the `set` function, an attacker can modify the `Object.prototype`, affecting all JavaScript objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt the application's functionality leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If the application uses `eval` or similar functions on object attributes, the attacker can inject malicious code by polluting a specific attribute within the object's prototype, leading to RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify critical properties like cookies or tokens, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Path Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the "path" argument within the `set` function. By setting the path to values like `/__proto__/polluted` or `/constructor/prototype/polluted`, an attacker can pollute the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Path Parameter:** The attacker needs to control or influence the "path" parameter passed to the `json-pointer` library's `set` function.
*   **Ability to call the vulnerable function:** The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable `set` function of `json-pointer` library with a malicious path.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the `set` function does not properly sanitize the path before using it to set values.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject a property into the prototype:

    ```javascript
    var pointer = require('json-pointer');
    var obj = {};
    pointer.set(obj, '/__proto__/polluted', true);
    console.log(obj.polluted); //true
    ```
*   The fix involves checking if the path token is one of `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` and skipping setting a value on these specific properties to prevent prototype pollution.
* The vulnerability affects versions of `json-pointer` below 0.6.1 (npm) and below 0.6.2 (maven)

In summary, the `json-pointer` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to a lack of proper input validation when setting property values via a path. This allows attackers to potentially cause DoS, RCE or Property Injection by manipulating the `Object.prototype`.
