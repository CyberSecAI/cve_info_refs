Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `connection-tester` npm package. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided input in the `test` function. This function takes host and port values as input, which are then used in a command that gets executed directly by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system. This occurs because the host input is not sanitized before being used in a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious commands into the host input, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server running the `connection-tester` module.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The vulnerability is rated with high impact for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This means an attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify system files, or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is network-exploitable, which means an attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely (via a network).
- **Input Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious string containing shell commands and inserts it into the `host` parameter of the `test` function call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or authorization to exploit this vulnerability, making it easy to exploit.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to know how to call the `test` function of the `connection-tester` library and the structure of the expected input to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `index.js`, line 15.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided which uses a crafted host string with command injection to demonstrate the vulnerability: `a.test("& touch 111","& touch 222",123)`
- The fix involves upgrading `connection-tester` to version 0.2.1 or higher.
- CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (Critical).

**Additional Notes:**
- Snyk assigned the ID `SNYK-JS-CONNECTIONTESTER-1048337` to track this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was disclosed on Dec 4, 2020, and published on Dec 16, 2020.
