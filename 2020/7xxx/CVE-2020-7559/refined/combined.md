# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1140

## Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Control Expert PLC Simulator Modbus message processing remote code execution vulnerability

##### December 8, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-7559

### Summary

A code execution vulnerability exists in the Modbus message-processing functionality of Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Control Expert PLC Simulator 14.1. A specially crafted network request can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a large Modbus request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Control Expert PLC Simulator 14.1

### Product URLs

<https://www.se.com/ww/en/product-range-presentation/548-ecostruxure%E2%84%A2-control-expert/>

### CVSSv3 Score

10.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

EcoStruxure Control Expert (formerly UnityPro) is Schneider Electric’s flagship software for program development, maintenance, and monitoring of industrial networks. To aid in the testing process of developed programs, a device simulator is included with Control Expert. When the simulator mode is started, it opens 0.0.0.0:502 on the host, allowing for communication with the simulator via Modbus.

When a large Modbus message is sent to this simulator, it is possible to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer, allowing for remote code execution.

In function `sub_1b48b00` a stack buffer of 0x8000 bytes is reserved to hold the Modbus message data. This buffer will be used as the `dst` argument of a subsequent `memcpy` call.

```
//
// sub_1b48b00
//
...
01b48be1  lea     edx, [ebp-0x8004]       # allocate a stack buffer
01b48be7  push    edx                     # arg1
01b48be8  call    sub_1b495c0             # call to vulnerable function
...

```

Execution continues into `sub_1b495c0` where the Modbus message to be processed is copied into the previously reserved stack buffer. This is done via a `memcpy` call with the following arguments:

`dst`: pointer to the stack buffer described above
`src`: pointer to the head of the current Modbus message
`n` : value pulled from the current Modbus message MBAP header length field

```
//
// sub_1b495c0
//
...
01b4962a  mov     ecx, dword [ebp-0x4]
01b4962d  movzx   edx, word [ecx+0x11]
01b49631  push    edx                     # n (mbap_len) (user controlled)
01b49632  mov     eax, dword [ebp-0x4]
01b49635  mov     ecx, dword [eax+0x9]
01b49638  push    ecx                     # src (Modbus_msg_p) (user controlled)
01b49639  mov     edx, dword [ebp+0x8]
01b4963c  push    edx                     # dst (arg1)
01b4963d  call    memcpy                  # memcpy(dst, Modbus_msg_p, mbap_len)
...

```

Since both the `src` and `n` arguments are determined by the user controlled Modbus message, and since there is no check to ensure that the message length is smaller than the buffer size, it is possible to use the `memcpy` call to write outside of the reserved buffer and gain execution through corruption of the program’s exception handler.
