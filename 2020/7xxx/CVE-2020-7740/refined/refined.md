Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7740

**Root Cause:** The `node-pdf-generator` package is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to a lack of user input validation and sanitization of the content provided to the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application takes user-provided HTML content and uses it to generate a PDF. This content can include URLs which will be fetched by the server, allowing for SSRF attacks.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the user-provided HTML, including URLs, making it vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can make the server perform requests to internal or external resources.
* Potential for data exfiltration from internal networks or interaction with other internal services, denial of service by targeting high resource endpoints.
* Possible information disclosure.
* The application might be used to probe internal network resources by sending crafted requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
* By sending a crafted HTML payload that includes a malicious URL to the `node-pdf-generator`, an attacker can induce the server to make requests to that URL.
* This crafted payload is sent via POST request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
* No special privileges are required for the attack.
* The attacker can be external as the vulnerable component is exposed on the network.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability exists in the way the `node-pdf-generator` package processes user input, specifically the HTML content used to generate PDFs.
* The lack of sanitization in the package's code allows attackers to craft HTML content with malicious URLs that cause the server to make requests to those URLs during PDF generation.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to clone the vulnerable repository, run the server and exploit it with a crafted curl command.
* The vulnerable code can be found in index.js line 29.

**Additional Information:**
* There is no fixed version for the `node-pdf-generator` package to date.
* The vulnerability was disclosed on September 3, 2020.
