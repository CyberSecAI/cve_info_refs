PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X is the classic engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC S7-300/S7-
400/C7/WinAC controllers.

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS7 and other components.

SIMATIC PDM (Process Device Manager) is an universal, manufacturer-independent tool for conﬁguration,
parameter assignment, commissioning, diagnostics and maintenance of intelligent process devices
(actors, sensors) and automation components (remote I/Os, multiplexer, process control units, compact
controller).

STARTER is the drive engineering tool for parameterizing and commissioning.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7585

A DLL Hijacking vulnerability could allow a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires user privileges but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow
an attacker to compromise the availability of the system as well as to have access to conﬁdential
information.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7586

A buffer overﬂow vulnerability could allow a local attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service situation.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires user privileges but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow
an attacker to compromise the availability of the system as well as to have access to conﬁdential
information.
