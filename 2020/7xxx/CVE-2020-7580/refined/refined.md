Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a common component used by multiple Siemens applications that invokes a helper binary with SYSTEM privileges. The call path to this binary is not enclosed in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unquoted Search Path:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper quoting of the executable path when calling the helper binary. This allows for the potential of a malicious executable with the same name as a directory in the path to be executed instead.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** The affected applications call the helper binary with SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation would give the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the affected Siemens software is installed.
- **Path Manipulation:** By creating a malicious executable in a directory within the search path, an attacker can gain elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a low level of privilege and must be able to execute code locally on the target system.
- The attacker needs to create an executable with the name that can be inserted into the unquoted path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory lists a large number of affected Siemens products including: SIMATIC, SINAMICS, SINEC, SINEMA and SINUMERIK
- The advisory includes workarounds: preventing the creation of executables in the vulnerable paths and disabling the TraceConceptX service.
- The advisory provides links to updates for each affected product.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and no known exploits are available.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2020-7580, which involves an unquoted search path vulnerability leading to local privilege escalation. The provided content provides significantly more detail on the affected products and remediation steps.
