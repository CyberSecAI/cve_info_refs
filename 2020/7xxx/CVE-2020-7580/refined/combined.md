WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Make sure that there is no executable at the following locations:

– C:\\Program.exe,
– C:\\Program\ Files\\Common.exe, or
– C:\\Program\ Files\\Common\ Files\\Siemens\\Automation\\Simatic.exe

• Deactivate the Windows service called TraceConceptX. This leads to loss of tracing functionality

and should only be considered as a temporary workaround.

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

environments.

SINUMERIK Operate is a standard Human-Machine-Interface system for SINUMERIK numerical controls.

STARTER is the drive engineering tool for parameterizing and commissioning.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7580

A common component used by the affected applications regularly calls a helper binary with SYSTEM
privileges while the call path is not quoted.

This could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYTEM privileges.

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that can be applied to reduce the risk:

* Ensure there is no executable at the following locations:
  + C:\Program.exe
  + C:\Program Files\Common.exe
  + C:\Program Files\Common Files\Siemens\Automation\Simatic.exe
* Deactivate the Windows service called TraceConceptX. This leads to loss of tracing functionality and should only be considered a temporary workaround.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
