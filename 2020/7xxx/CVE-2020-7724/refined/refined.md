Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7724

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Prototype Pollution issue in the `tiny-conf` package. Specifically, the `set` function is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects by using the `set` function with a path that includes `__proto__`. This allows modification of the base object prototype.
- **Unsafe Property Definition by Path:** The library uses a function that allows setting properties based on a given path, which, if controlled by an attacker, can be manipulated to target the `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates an object's property (e.g., using `eval`), the attacker can pollute the prototype with malicious code to achieve RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can pollute properties that the codebase relies on, such as security properties like `isAdmin`, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other unintended behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `set` function of the `tiny-conf` package.
- An attacker can manipulate the "path" parameter of the `set` function to include `__proto__` and inject arbitrary values, thus polluting the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `set` function, specifically the "path" parameter. This could be via a user-provided configuration file, command line arguments, or any other way that the `tiny-conf` package uses to receive configuration data.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited both client-side (in web browsers) and on the server-side (in Node.js applications).
- The report mentions that there is no fixed version for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a high CVSS score, which indicates its criticality.
- The provided POC demonstrates the exploit by setting `__proto__.polluted` to `true`.
