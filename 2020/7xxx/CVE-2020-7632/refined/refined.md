Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-controlled input passed to the `binary` option when initializing the `node-mpv` library. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system via the `exec` function in `util.js`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands due to unsanitized user input passed into the `exec` function via the `binary` option. This is a classic example of CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `node-mpv` library fails to properly sanitize the user-supplied `binary` option, allowing an attacker to embed malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where the `node-mpv` library is running.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can potentially gain full control over the system, leading to the potential loss of confidentiality (access to sensitive information), integrity (modification of data), and availability (denial of service). Specifically, Snyk's analysis states that there is a total loss of confidentiality, low integrity impact, and no availability impact, although other impacts are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:**  The vulnerability is exploitable over the network if the application using the `node-mpv` library is accessible remotely.
- **User Input:** Attackers manipulate the `binary` option during the initialization of the `node-mpv` library

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `binary` option passed during the initialization of the `node-mpv` library.
- **No Privileges Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authorization.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The attack doesn't rely on user actions.

**Additional Details:**
- The Snyk vulnerability report indicates that the vulnerability exists in versions >= 0.12.2 of the `node-mpv` package.
- Snyk provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 from Snyk, and 9.8 from NVD. Snyk's score is Medium severity whereas NVD's score is Critical.
- The `node-mpv` package is a wrapper for using the mpv media player with Node.js.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `util.js` file of the `node-mpv` library.

**Mitigation:**
- No fixed version is provided according to the report. The fix would involve sanitizing user-controlled input before passing it to `exec`.
