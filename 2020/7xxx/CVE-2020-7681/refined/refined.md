Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of path sanitization in the `fs.readFile` function within the `index.js` file of the `marscode` package. This allows attackers to manipulate the path provided to this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. By injecting `../` sequences or absolute file paths, an attacker can access files and directories outside of the intended application directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the system, such as application source code, configuration files, and other critical system files, leading to a potential breach of confidentiality.
- The proof of concept shows how an attacker could retrieve the content of the `test.js` file that exists outside of the intended application directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests by manipulating the URL path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authorization or user interaction. They need to send a specially crafted network request to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
-  The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the server running the vulnerable marscode application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using a `curl` command.
- There is no fixed version for the `marscode` package.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a high severity issue.
- The content references two types of directory traversal: information disclosure and arbitrary file writing. The `marscode` package vulnerability falls into the information disclosure category.
