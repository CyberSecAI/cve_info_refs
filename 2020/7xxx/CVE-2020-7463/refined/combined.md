FreeBSD-SA-20:25.sctp Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: SCTP socket use-after-free bug
Category: core
Module: kernel
Announced: 2020-09-02
Credits: Megan2013678@protonmail.com
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2020-08-24 09:19:05 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
2020-09-02 16:24:32 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p9)
2020-08-24 09:46:36 UTC (stable/11, 11.4-STABLE)
2020-09-02 16:24:32 UTC (releng/11.4, 11.4-RELEASE-p3)
2020-09-02 16:24:32 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p13)
CVE Name: CVE-2020-7463
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a message oriented
transport protocol supporting arbitrary large user messages.
It can be accessed from applications by using the the socket API.
II. Problem Description
Due to improper handling in the kernel, a use-after-free bug can be triggered
by sending large user messages from multiple threads on the same socket.
III. Impact
Triggering the use-after-free situation may result in unintended kernel
behaviour including a kernel panic.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and reboot.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 12.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.12.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.12.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sctp.12.1.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 11.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.11.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.11.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sctp.11.4.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 11.3]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.11.3.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:25/sctp.11.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify sctp.11.3.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
