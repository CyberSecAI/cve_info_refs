**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a vulnerability within Elasticsearch versions 6.7.0 through 6.8.7 and 7.0.0 through 7.6.1. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the provided text.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The weakness is present in the Elasticsearch versions used within NetApp products. This implies a flaw in the code or logic of Elasticsearch that allows for unintended access or manipulation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Disclosure of sensitive information:** Attackers could gain access to confidential data stored within Elasticsearch.
*   **Addition or modification of data:** Attackers could alter or add to the existing data within Elasticsearch, potentially causing data integrity issues or operational problems.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could disrupt the availability of the Elasticsearch service, rendering it unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is a network-based exploit, as inferred from the CVSS vector: "AV:N" (Attack Vector: Network).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable Elasticsearch instance is located.
*   **Low Privileges**: The CVSS vector indicates "PR:L", suggesting that the attacker requires low privileges, meaning that they could exploit the vulnerability even with limited access.
*   **No User Interaction**: The CVSS vector indicates "UI:N" , meaning no user interaction is required to trigger the exploit

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

*   **Affected Products:** The provided NetApp advisory clarifies that, although multiple NetApp products incorporate Elasticsearch, none of the listed products are, in fact, *affected*.
*   **Unaffected Products:** The advisory contains an extensive list of NetApp products that are explicitly *not* affected by this vulnerability. This level of detail exceeds what is available in the basic CVE description.
*   **Mitigation:** NetApp's advisory indicates there are no current workarounds and the software fixes will be released through their support site when available.
*   **CVSS Score:** The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.8 (HIGH), along with the full CVSS vector string, providing better context on the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

This document confirms that CVE-2020-7014 relates to a vulnerability in specific versions of Elasticsearch. Exploitation could lead to sensitive data disclosure, data modification, or denial of service. The attack is network-based and can be conducted by an attacker with low privileges and without user interaction. While many NetApp products integrate Elasticsearch, none are ultimately considered affected, according to the vendor advisory, which provides a detailed list of unaffected products.  NetApp did not provide workarounds and advises users to obtain future fixes through their support website.
