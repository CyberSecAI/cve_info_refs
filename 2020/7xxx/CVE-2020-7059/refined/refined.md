  "CVE-2020-7059": {
    "description": "When using fgetss() function to read data with stripping tags, in PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.27, 7.3.x below 7.3.14 and 7.4.x below 7.4.2 it is possible to supply data that will cause this function to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `fgetss()` function when used to read data with tag stripping. Specifically, the function can read past the allocated buffer when supplied with certain crafted data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Out-of-bounds Read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service or information disclosure due to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special capabilities/privileges.  An attacker only needs the ability to send malicious input to a PHP script that uses the vulnerable `fgetss()` function with tag stripping to trigger the out-of-bounds read."
