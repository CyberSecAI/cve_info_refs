The provided content relates to a code change in the "Ultimate FAQ" WordPress plugin, specifically a modification to the `DisplayFAQs.php` file. This change is relevant to understanding a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the use of `$_GET['Display_FAQ']` without proper sanitization when constructing a JavaScript variable. The original code directly used the value from `$_GET['Display_FAQ']`, which is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was vulnerable to XSS because it was directly embedding user-controlled input (`$_GET['Display_FAQ']`) into a JavaScript context without proper sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which could lead to:
    - **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
    - **Website defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the website.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Malware distribution:** Injecting code that downloads and installs malware.
    - **Account takeover:** Potentially gaining control of user accounts by stealing login credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_GET['Display_FAQ']` parameter. An attacker could craft a malicious URL with a crafted `Display_FAQ` value, which would be reflected in the JavaScript variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to craft a URL that contains the malicious JavaScript payload within the `Display_FAQ` parameter.
- No special privileges or access to the server would be needed.
- The attack could be performed remotely.

**Mitigation:**
- The code change replaced `~~$_GET['Display_FAQ']~~` with `intval($_GET['Display_FAQ'])`. This change sanitizes the input by converting it to an integer, which would prevent XSS attacks by stripping out any malicious JavaScript.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content shows a specific code diff related to the fix for this vulnerability. The original code was vulnerable due to the direct usage of a GET parameter, which was later fixed by sanitizing the input via `intval()`.
