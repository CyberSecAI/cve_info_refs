  "CVE-2020-7644": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The `fun-map` package is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The `members` argument of the `create` function in `class.js` can be controlled by users without any sanitization, allowing code injection.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `members` argument in the `create` function of the `pixl-class` library, which `fun-map` uses, is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Arbitrary Code Execution",
		"Code Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client running the affected application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Code injection through the vulnerable `create` function"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can control the `members` argument in the `create` function of `pixl-class` to inject malicious code.",
	  "poc": "```javascript\nvar a = require(\"pixl-class\");\nvar members = {\n  __parent:'function(){}; console.log(123)//}'\n}\n\na.create(members);\n```"
