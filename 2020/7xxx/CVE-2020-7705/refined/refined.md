Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7705:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from malicious code embedded within the MintegralAdSDK, a mobile advertising SDK for both iOS and Android platforms. This code is designed to perform ad fraud and gather user data without the user's explicit consent or knowledge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Method Swizzling (iOS):** The SDK uses method swizzling to replace implementations of `UIApplication openURL`, `SKStoreProductViewController loadProductWithParameters` and registers a custom `NSURLProtocol` class. This allows it to intercept and monitor user interactions with URLs, including those related to app store links and HTTP requests within the app.
2.  **Excessive Data Collection (iOS):** The SDK collects and transmits sensitive user data, including:
    *   URLs opened by the user, which could contain identifiers or other private information.
    *   HTTP request headers, potentially containing authentication tokens, cookies and basic authentication headers.
    *   Stack traces, device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV), OS version, and user agent.
    *   App store product IDs accessed by the user.
3.  **Ad Attribution Fraud (iOS):** The SDK intercepts ad clicks, even those from competing ad networks, and falsely reports them as originating from Mintegral. This results in mis-attribution of ad clicks and revenue being diverted to Mintegral.
4. **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Backdoor (iOS):** The SDK contained a backdoor through the `MTGBaseBridgeWebView` class, which is used for communication with Javascript and allows for the execution of arbitrary native code. This can be achieved by crafting specific Javascript code delivered through ads.
5. **Download Tracking (Android):** The SDK tracks and reports all downloaded files from Google, which includes browser and app downloads, attachments from emails and links from Google Docs. This data is sent to Mintegral's servers, and is sent when a URL contains `google.com` or ends with `.apk`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Financial Loss:** Developers using the SDK may lose revenue due to ad attribution fraud, and may also lose revenue if they are not using Mintegral to serve ads since the SDK intercepts clicks regardless. Competing ad networks also suffer financial losses.
*   **Privacy Violation:** User data is collected and transmitted without explicit consent or knowledge, potentially exposing personal information and sensitive data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can gain full control of the application through the RCE vulnerability, leading to potential data theft, manipulation, or other malicious actions.
*   **Malicious Ad Delivery:** The RCE vulnerability can be exploited through interactive ads, allowing attackers to target specific users or devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SDK Integration (iOS/Android):** By incorporating the malicious SDK into an app, developers unknowingly introduce these vulnerabilities.
*   **Method Swizzling/Hooks (iOS):** The SDK intercepts method calls within the application's code using method swizzling, hooking, and custom `NSURLProtocol` class, giving it control over URL loading and navigation actions.
*  **Javascript Injection (iOS):** The RCE is achieved by injecting malicious Javascript through a webview, which allows the attacker to execute native code.
*  **Network Interception:**  Network debugging can be bypassed to analyze and exploit the vulnerability.
*   **URL Interception (Android):** The SDK registers a `ContentObserver` which intercepts download events for URL tracking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Software Supply Chain Compromise:** The attacker (Mintegral) needs to have a compromised/malicious SDK that is distributed to app developers.
*   **Network Control (for RCE):** The attacker needs to control the content served through the ad network, or have control over a MITM position.
*   **Ability to deliver ads:** For the RCE vulnerability the attacker can achieve this by purchasing ads or compromising the ad network.
*   **Basic Understanding of iOS/Android**: The attacker needs to understand the architecture of iOS/Android and the SDK functionality to execute the attacks.

**Additional Information:**

*   The SDK attempts to hide its malicious behavior by implementing anti-debugging and anti-proxy detection techniques. It checks for simulators, debuggers, jailbroken devices and proxy settings.
*   The SDK uses a custom Base64 encoding method to obfuscate collected data.
*   The malicious functionality is enabled even when the SDK is not actively serving ads.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Snyk Security Research team.
*   Mintegral removed the malicious functionality after it was disclosed by Snyk.

This detailed information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and how it can be exploited.
