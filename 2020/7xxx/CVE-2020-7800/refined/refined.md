Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions" (CWE-754). The device fails to properly handle specially crafted TCP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way the HUSKY RTU handles specific TCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can cause the device to shut down or reboot.
*   The device may lose configuration settings upon reboot.
*   This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted TCP packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. This implies network access to the device.
*   No authentication or special privileges are needed for exploitation, meaning the attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to HUSKY RTU models 6049-E70 with firmware versions 5.0 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.3, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H. This indicates it is network-based, with low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction and high availability impact.
*   The advisory notes that no public exploits specifically target this vulnerability as of the date of the advisory.
