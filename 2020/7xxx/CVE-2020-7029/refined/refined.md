- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the System Management Interface Web component of Avaya Aura Communication Manager and Avaya Aura Messaging.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a CSRF issue, allowing attackers to potentially execute web administration actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could perform web administration actions with the privileges of an authenticated user. This could lead to unauthorized access or modification of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed remotely via a web interface. The attacker needs to induce a user to initiate a request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into performing actions on the web interface, which requires social engineering and knowledge of the system's web interface. An attacker doesn't require authentication but needs to leverage an authenticated user's session.
