Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `runCommand()` function in the `linux/manager.js` file of the `node-prompt-here` package.
- This function constructs the argument for `execSync()` using user-controlled input from the environment variable `process.env.NM_CLI`.
- The user-controlled input is not sanitized before being passed to `execSync()`, which can execute arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input before using it in a system call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system where the vulnerable package is used.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  The Snyk description indicates a high impact on confidentiality, with potential for complete information disclosure. The impact to integrity and availability are marked as none according to the Snyk report. According to NVD this is a critical vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `process.env.NM_CLI` environment variable.
- An attacker can set this environment variable to inject malicious commands.
- When `getDevices()` is called, these malicious commands are executed by the vulnerable code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to set environment variables before the application using the vulnerable package is executed.
- No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attack is classified as network-based, meaning it could be exploited across a network, potentially via a remote access exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Snyk report provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The Snyk report lists a CVSS score of 5.9 (medium), while NVD lists a CVSS score of 9.8 (critical).
- The package has no fixed version to address the vulnerability.
