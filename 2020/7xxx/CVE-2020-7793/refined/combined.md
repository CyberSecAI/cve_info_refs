[CVE-2020-7793  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7793) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `ua-parser-js` to version 0.7.23 or higher.

## Overview

[ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) is a lightweight JavaScript-based user-agent string parser.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in multiple regexes (see linked commit for more info).

## Proof of Concept by Miguel de Moura

 `jsconst ua_parser = require('ua-parser-js');const N_SIZE = 5000;const MALICIOUS_UA = `android;;Trio${' '.repeat(N_SIZE)}buil`;// Trigger ReDoSua_parser(MALICIOUS_UA);`

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.webjars.npm:ua-parser-js` to version 0.7.23 or higher.

## Overview

[org.webjars.npm:ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js.git) is a WebJar for ua-parser-js

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in multiple regexes (see linked commit for more info).

## Proof of Concept by Miguel de Moura

 `jsconst ua_parser = require('ua-parser-js');const N_SIZE = 5000;const MALICIOUS_UA = `android;;Trio${' '.repeat(N_SIZE)}buil`;// Trigger ReDoSua_parser(MALICIOUS_UA);`

## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let’s take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn’t match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliﬁes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-4160

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms
are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because
the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis
suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difﬁcult to perform
and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difﬁcult)
because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed
ofﬂine. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be signiﬁcant. However, for an
attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple
clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions
1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December
2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium
support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects
OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m
(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23839

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is conﬁgured
to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version
rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater
than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than
SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding
is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server
support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding
is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if
a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a
normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x
are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have conﬁgured SSLv2
support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have conﬁgured SSLv2 support at runtime (this
is off by default), 3) have conﬁgured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite
list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue.
The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This
also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although
1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the
RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding
mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this
is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no
longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to
1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).

CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23841

The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash
value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certiﬁcate. However it
fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer ﬁeld (which might occur if
the issuer ﬁeld is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and
a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is
never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function
directly and they use it on certiﬁcates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL
1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of
OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL
1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25217

The affected products contain the third party component, ISC DHCP, that possesses a vulnerability
if used as a DHCP client or server. The vulnerability affects the DHCP package when storing and
reading DHCP lease information containing particular option information.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to affect the availability of the DHCP client or server, or
in the worst case affect the conﬁdentiality or integrity of device through a buffer overﬂow or cause a
remote-code execution.
