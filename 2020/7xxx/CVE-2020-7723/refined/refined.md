Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7723

**Root Cause:** The `insert` function in the `promisehelpers` package is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. This occurs because the function allows an attacker to control the path of the property being set, which can be manipulated to modify the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting properties into the `__proto__` attribute using the vulnerable `insert` function.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition:** The `insert` function does not properly sanitize or validate the input path, allowing the attacker to specify `__proto__` as part of the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt the application's functionality. For example, modifying `toString` to an integer instead of a function would break expected behavior.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In specific cases where the application evaluates properties of objects using methods like `eval`, an attacker can inject malicious code by polluting the prototype.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can manipulate properties that the application relies on for informative value or security, potentially achieving privilege escalation or other unauthorized actions. For example, setting `Object.prototype.isAdmin` to `true`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely by exploiting the application that uses the vulnerable library.
*   **Client-Side:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the input to the `insert` function in the `promisehelpers` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the vulnerable `insert` function, specifically the path argument.
*   No prior authorization is required.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `promisehelpers` versions less than `0.0.6`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to pollute the prototype using the vulnerable `insert` function.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes).
*   The vulnerability can lead to network-based attacks with a high severity impact on availability.

**Recommendations:**
*   Upgrade `promisehelpers` to version `0.0.6` or higher.
*   Use `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)` to prevent prototype modification.
*   Implement schema validation for JSON inputs.
*   Avoid unsafe recursive merge functions.
*   Use objects without prototypes (`Object.create(null)`).
*   Use `Map` instead of `Object` where appropriate.
