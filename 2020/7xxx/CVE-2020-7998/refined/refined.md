{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Super File Explorer app for iOS has an arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to the developer path being accessible and hidden next to the root path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability",
     "No password set for FTP or Web UI services by default",
     "Insecure access control to the developer path"
    ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can upload arbitrary files (webshell) to the device. This leads to complete compromise of the FTP server and mobile device including root access. Sensitive files like /etc/passwd can be accessed.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Network",
    "FTP service",
    "Web UI service"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attackers with network access to the device can exploit the vulnerability without any privilege application user account or user interaction. Basic understanding of FTP and web protocols are required."
