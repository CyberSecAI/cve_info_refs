  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a denial of service caused by a nil-pointer dereference when processing malformed XML signatures in SAML responses. This occurs because the code does not properly handle cases where an assertion has a nil parent element.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of a check for nil parent elements during the processing of SAML assertions. Specifically, the code attempts to access the parent of an unverified assertion without verifying that the parent pointer is not nil, leading to a nil pointer dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference",
         "Improper handling of malformed XML input",
        "Lack of input validation/sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by crashing the application that uses the affected library. The service becomes unavailable to legitimate users.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending malformed XML signatures within a SAML response to an application using the vulnerable library."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted SAML responses to the application that uses the vulnerable `github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2` library. This usually involves being able to manipulate the SAML response that the application receives from an identity provider."
