  "CVE-2020-7774": {
    "description": "The y18n npm package before versions 3.2.2, 4.0.1, and 5.0.5 is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to improper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain, potentially leading to denial of service or remote code execution. The vulnerability can be triggered using the `setLocale` and `updateLocale` methods.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "<3.2.2",
      ">=4.0.0 <4.0.1",
      ">=5.0.0 <5.0.5"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of input when setting and updating locale, allowing manipulation of the `__proto__` attribute.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, tampering with application source code to force code paths leading to remote code execution, or property injection to modify security properties.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to make requests that reach the vulnerable code, no authentication required, no user interaction required.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from the way the `y18n` library handles locale settings. Specifically, the library fails to sanitize the input when setting or updating the locale, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` using the `__proto__` attribute. This leads to all JavaScript objects inheriting the injected properties which can be manipulated by an attacker."
