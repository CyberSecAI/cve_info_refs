{
  "CVE-2020-7247": {
    "Description": "OpenSMTPD's smtp_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating sender (MAIL FROM) and recipient (RCPT TO) mail addresses. If the local part of an address is invalid and the domain name is empty, smtp_mailaddr() will automatically add a domain name as opposed to failing because of the invalid local address. This will allow the invalid local address to pass through the function without validation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The smtp_mailaddr function in OpenSMTPD incorrectly handles email addresses with an invalid local part and an empty domain. Instead of rejecting such addresses, it adds the default domain and allows the message to be processed, bypassing input sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges. This can lead to privilege escalation on mbox deliveries and unprivileged code execution on lmtp deliveries.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local SMTP session using specially crafted MAIL FROM addresses.",
      "Remote SMTP session, sending a crafted email with an invalid sender address."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted email to the vulnerable OpenSMTPD server. For local exploitation, they need to have local access to the server. For remote exploitation, they need to be able to send emails to the server."
