Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7755

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in the `dat.gui` library. The regular expressions used to parse `rgb` and `rgba` color strings are vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inefficient regular expressions: The regex patterns `/^rgb\(\s*(.+)\s*,\s*(.+)\s*,\s*(.+)\s*\)/` and `/^rgba\(\s*(.+)\s*,\s*(.+)\s*,\s*(.+)\s*,\s*(.+)\s*\)/` used in `dat.gui/src/dat/color/interpret.js` are susceptible to ReDoS due to the sub-pattern `\s*(.+)\s*`. This pattern allows for an arbitrary number of spaces and characters to be matched, leading to excessive backtracking when processing crafted inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By providing specially crafted, long color strings with numerous spaces, an attacker can cause the regex engine to perform a large number of backtracking operations. This consumes excessive CPU resources, making the application unresponsive and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a long `rgb` or `rgba` string with a high number of spaces to the application, which is then parsed by the vulnerable regex.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges or user interaction are required. An attacker can send a malicious input string to the application from the network.
- The attacker does not need access to the vulnerable system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.7.8 of `dat.gui`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li.
- The Snyk vulnerability ID is SNYK-JS-DATGUI-1016275.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability by injecting long strings with spaces into the color input of the `dat.gui`.
- The vulnerability has a high severity CVSS score of 7.5.
- The attack vector is network based.
- The attack complexity is low.
- No user interaction or special privileges is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Exploitation results in high impact on availability.
