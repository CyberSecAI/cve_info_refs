Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2020-7069:**

*   **Root Cause:** When using AES-CCM mode with the `openssl_encrypt()` function in PHP, versions prior to 7.2.34, 7.3.23, and 7.4.11 incorrectly handle a 12-byte Initialization Vector (IV), utilizing only the first 7 bytes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is due to an incorrect handling of the IV length in the `openssl_encrypt()` function, specifically when using AES-CCM mode, which causes it to truncate the IV.
*  **Impact:** This leads to:
    *   **Decreased Security:** By truncating the IV, the encryption becomes weaker, making it potentially easier for an attacker to compromise the data.
    *   **Incorrect Encryption Data:** The usage of an incomplete IV can lead to the production of incorrect ciphertext, potentially causing data corruption or failure of data integrity checks.
*   **Attack vectors:** This vulnerability is exploitable by any application using openssl\_encrypt with AES-CCM mode in the affected PHP versions. This may occur by providing a 12-byte IV to the vulnerable function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * An attacker needs to be able to control the IV that is used when calling `openssl_encrypt` with `aes-128-ccm` in the affected PHP version.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of URL-decoded cookie names within PHP's HTTP cookie processing.
*   **Impact:** Attackers may forge secure cookies by sending a percent-encoded cookie that will decode to a secure prefix, causing misinterpretation by the web application leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending HTTP requests with crafted cookie names that, after URL decoding, match a sensitive prefix, such as `__Host-`, can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with crafted cookie names.
  
**CVE-2020-7066:**

*    **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by using a URL with a null byte in it as a parameter to the `get_headers()` function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to control the URL parameter provided to `get_headers()` and introduce a null character.
