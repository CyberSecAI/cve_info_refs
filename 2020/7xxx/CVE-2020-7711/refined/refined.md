Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a nil-pointer dereference within the `goxmldsig` library when processing malformed XML signatures. Specifically, the `validateSignature` function attempts to use a `SignatureValue` without verifying if it's not nil, leading to a crash if it is.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Nil-pointer dereference:** The code does not check if `sig.SignatureValue` is nil before attempting to access its `Data` field, causing a panic and program termination.
- **Lack of input validation:** The library fails to properly handle malformed XML inputs, specifically in the signature validation process, leading to the crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can cause the service using the `goxmldsig` library to crash, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is due to the nil-pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malformed XML signature:** An attacker can craft a malicious XML document with a missing or invalid `SignatureValue` element, which when parsed by the vulnerable library triggers the nil pointer dereference during signature validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send or provide malformed XML signatures to the service using the vulnerable `goxmldsig` library. The attacker does not require any specific access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability. This means the attacker could be external or internal, depending on the application's architecture.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was present in versions of `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` prior to 1.1.1.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `sig.SignatureValue` is not nil before accessing its `Data` field in the `validateSignature` function.
- Snyk assigned the ID **SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMRUSSELLHAERINGGOXMLDSIG-608301** to this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is rated as High severity.
