Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7659

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers in the `reel` web server. Specifically, the server:
  * Allows duplicate `Content-Length` headers.
  * Parses invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers as valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The core vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling, arising from the inconsistent handling of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This allows an attacker to manipulate how the server interprets request boundaries.
*   **Incorrect Header Parsing:** The server's failure to properly handle duplicate `Content-Length` headers and invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers are the direct causes enabling request smuggling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Web-Cache Poisoning:** By manipulating HTTP responses, an attacker can poison web caches, leading to serving malicious content to other users.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Manipulated responses could inject malicious scripts into the victim's browser by sending a crafted response, enabling XSS attacks.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own by crafting a smuggled request.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through network requests to the vulnerable server. Specifically, by sending crafted HTTP requests with:
*   Duplicate `Content-Length` headers.
*   Invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable `reel` server.
*   No special privileges or user interaction are required. The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Details:**
* The `reel` package is deprecated and no longer maintained.
* There is no fixed version available for the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

The provided information aligns with the description of HTTP Request Smuggling, where the server misinterprets the length and boundaries of HTTP requests. This results in the server processing the request differently than intended, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious data or bypass security mechanisms.
