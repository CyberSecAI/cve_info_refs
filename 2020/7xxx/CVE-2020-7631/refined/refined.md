Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within the `diskusage-ng` package. Specifically, the `path` argument passed to the `diskusage` function is used in a command execution without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The unsanitized `path` argument is directly used in the `execFile` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    - Data exfiltration
    - System compromise
    - Denial of service
    - Installation of malware

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `path` argument of the `diskusage` function, which is exposed via the package's API.
- By providing a malicious string as the `path` argument, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. For example, the proof of concept shows how the attacker can inject a command like `touch Song` by using `["\"&touch Song\""]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `diskusage` function, which is likely a user-supplied path or file parameter within a consuming application using the vulnerable `diskusage-ng` package.
- No special privileges are required for exploitation, as indicated by "Privileges Required: None".

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in `diskusage-ng` versions prior to 1.0.0.
- The Snyk analysis indicates a medium severity score of 6.5, while NVD gives a critical score of 9.8. This difference can be due to varying scoring methodologies.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable as described by "Attack Vector: Network".
- The exploit has a proof of concept, making it a higher risk.
- The exploit does not need user interaction "User Interaction: None".
- The vulnerability affects integrity by allowing modification of data, though the attacker does not have control over the amount of modification of data, and the modification itself does not have a direct impact "Integrity: Low".
- The vulnerability causes total loss of confidentiality "Confidentiality: High".

In summary, CVE-2020-7631 in the `diskusage-ng` package is a critical command injection vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by controlling the `path` argument.
