The provided content is related to CVE-2020-7674.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `access-policy` package's `template` function utilizes the `eval` function to execute user-supplied input, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper use of `eval` with user-controlled input.
- Arbitrary code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Complete loss of confidentiality, meaning an attacker can access all resources within the impacted component.
- Possible modification of data, although the attacker may not have full control over the consequences.
- Reduction in performance or interruptions in resource availability.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network based. The vulnerable component is accessible over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges are required.
- No user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote, and doesn't need access to the vulnerable system prior to the attack.
