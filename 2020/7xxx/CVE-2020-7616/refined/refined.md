Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization when the `express-mock-middleware` package parses exported functions from files within the designated mock directory. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `Object.prototype` by injecting malicious properties through the exported functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core issue is that the middleware is vulnerable to prototype pollution. It allows attackers to add or modify properties of the `Object.prototype`, which can have widespread impacts.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The middleware does not sanitize the exported function names, meaning an attacker can provide specially crafted keys that interact with the prototype chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Although the Snyk analysis mentions ReDoS as a general issue, it's not the direct impact of this particular vulnerability. The prototype pollution vulnerability can indirectly lead to DoS by modifying core JavaScript object behavior which can cause crashes or unexpected behavior.
- Modification of Object Prototype: By polluting the prototype, an attacker can manipulate the behavior of all objects in the application, potentially leading to unexpected or malicious behavior.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how the vulnerability can be used to modify the `toString` method of all objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Mock File: The attacker must create a malicious JavaScript file within the designated mock directory. The file should export functions with crafted keys that target the `Object.prototype`.
- Directory Creation: The attacker has to place the malicious code in a directory where the middleware will read it from.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- File System Access: The attacker needs write access to the file system where the application runs to create the mock directory with the attack files.
- Ability to introduce malicious code into the mock directory used by the express-mock-middleware.
- The attacker does not need to interact directly with the vulnerable system or a user.

**Additional Details:**
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept demonstrating the exploit.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 3.6 (low) by Snyk and 5.3 (medium) by NVD.
