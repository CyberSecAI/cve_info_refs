Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary commands as part of the `pomelo-monitor` parameters. Specifically, the `pid` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server running `pomelo-monitor`.
*   **Command Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the `pid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially access all resources within the impacted component.
*  **Limited Integrity Impact:** Modification of data is possible, but the attacker has limited control over the consequence of the modification.
*  **No Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not impact the availability of the impacted component.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is exposed over the network, making it remotely exploitable.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The attack vector is injecting malicious commands via the `pid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `pid` parameter is vulnerable to command injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `getPsInfo` function of the `processMonitor.js` file.
*   The proof-of-concept (PoC) shows how to inject commands using the `pid` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is described as a CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).

**Additional Notes:**

*   There is no fixed version for `pomelo-monitor`.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium) from Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) from NVD, indicating a significant risk.
