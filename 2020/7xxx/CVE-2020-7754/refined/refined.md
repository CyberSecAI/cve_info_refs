```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regular expression used to validate email addresses, which exhibits catastrophic backtracking when processing long input strings that start with the '@' character.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting specially crafted email addresses, leading to excessive CPU consumption, making the service unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the network. The attacker sends a malicious string to the email validation function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs no special privileges, only the ability to send data to the vulnerable function. No user interaction is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "regex_example": "The provided example regex `/A(B|C+)+D/` demonstrates how a regex engine might explore multiple paths when validating strings, leading to a large number of steps (catastrophic backtracking) with non-matching inputs. The vulnerability is caused by a similar issue in the email validation regex.",
    "patch_details": "The vulnerability is fixed by updating the regular expression and adding a limit to the email length to 254 characters.",
    "workarounds": "Workarounds include restricting the character length of the input before email validation and more rigorous sanitization/validation before processing the email string."
