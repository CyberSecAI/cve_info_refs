Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `classToPlainFromExist` function in the `class-transformer` library. This function doesn't properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects via the `__proto__` property. This occurs due to insufficient input validation in the `classToPlainFromExist` function. Specifically, the code iterates over keys without checking or sanitizing them, allowing the injection of `__proto__` or `constructor` properties to modify the prototype chain.
- **Unsafe object merging:** The `classToPlainFromExist` function performs an unsafe merge of properties from the source object, including the `__proto__` and `constructor` properties, into a target object, enabling the pollution of the `Object.prototype`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties such as `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios where code evaluates object attributes and executes them using functions like `eval()`, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code via the prototype and execute arbitrary commands.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary properties into the `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to privilege escalation. If a codebase relies on a property like `isAdmin`, the attacker could set this property to `true` for all objects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By supplying a crafted JSON payload with a `__proto__` or `constructor` property to `classToPlainFromExist`, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to control the input to the vulnerable function or any function which uses it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to control the input that is passed to the vulnerable function `classToPlainFromExist` or control over data that is passed to it indirectly.
- No special privileges are required since the vulnerable code can be exploited by passing a JSON object to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in versions prior to 0.3.1 of the `class-transformer` package.
- The fix was implemented by adding a check within the code to skip keys equal to `__proto__` or `constructor`.
- Snyk's analysis determined the exploit maturity to be at "Proof of concept".
- The CVSS score assigned by Snyk is 4.2 (Medium), while the NVD score is 5.3 (Medium).
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading the `class-transformer` package to version 0.3.1 or higher.
- Other prevention methods include: freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`, requiring schema validation for JSON inputs, avoiding unsafe recursive merges, using objects without prototypes and using `Map` instead of `Object`.
