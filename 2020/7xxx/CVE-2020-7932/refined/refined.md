Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the browser's default behavior of sending the full URL of the current page, including query parameters and object IDs, in the HTTP referrer header when a user clicks a hyperlink. This information, if sensitive, can be exposed to the target server.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Referrer Header Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of sensitive information through the referrer header.
    *   **Lack of Referrer Policy:** Older versions of OMERO.web do not properly set the referrer policy to prevent this leakage.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive information in the URL, potentially including user IDs, object IDs, or other critical data.
    *   The severity is rated as "Major"
    *   The CVSS score is 5.9, which indicates medium severity. The vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CR:L/IR:L/AR:L/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:L/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:H/MA:N

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Links:** An attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link within the OMERO.web interface.
    *   **Web Referrer:** The referrer header is the primary channel for the information leak.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to create malicious links:** The attacker needs the ability to create a link that would be clicked by a user of the affected system.
    *   **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires low privileges, and user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
