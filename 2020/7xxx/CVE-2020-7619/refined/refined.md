Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7619:

**Root Cause:**
- The `get-git-data` npm package is vulnerable to command injection because it does not sanitize the `limit` argument in its `log` function. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying `git log` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the execution of the `git log` command.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `limit` argument, which is user-controlled, is not properly sanitized before being passed to the `git log` command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running.
- **Potential for Data Breaches/System Compromise:** The ability to execute commands can lead to various malicious activities, including data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service attacks.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Risks:** Exploitation can lead to total loss of confidentiality, allow for modification of data, and cause system unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker controls the `limit` argument that is passed to the `log` function of the `get-git-data` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `limit` argument passed to the `log` function. This could be through an application that uses the vulnerable package directly or through an intermediary.
- No specific privileges or user interaction is required for the attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `index.js` of the `get-git-data` package, specifically where the `git log` command is constructed:
```javascript
let cmd = `git log --no-color --pretty=format:'{ "commitHash": "%H", "commitMessage": "%s", "timestamp": "%at000", "authorName": "%an" },' --abbrev-commit`;  if (limit) { cmd = `${cmd} -${limit}`; }
```
- The provided PoC demonstrates how a malicious user could execute a `touch` command by injecting `"& touch Song"` into the `limit` parameter:
```javascript
var root = require("get-git-data");
root.log("& touch Song");
```

**Additional Notes:**
- Snyk classifies the vulnerability as medium severity with a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.9, while NVD rates it as critical with a CVSS score of 9.8
- The vulnerability is present in `get-git-data` package versions >=1.3.0
- There is currently no fixed version for `get-git-data`
- The vulnerability is a result of command injection and lack of input sanitization, not XSS, despite the mention of XSS within the content.
