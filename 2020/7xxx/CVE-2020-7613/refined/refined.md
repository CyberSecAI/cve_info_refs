Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `_is_clamav_binary` function within the `index.js` file of the `clamscan` npm package. This function is responsible for verifying if a given path points to a valid ClamAV binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `path` parameter, which is supposed to be the path to the ClamAV binary, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious path. The injected commands will be executed when the `cpExecFile` function runs the clamav binary.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate the provided binary path, which enables an attacker to supply a malicious command string instead of a legitimate path to the clamav binary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   **System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary code, the attacker can gain full control of the affected server, leading to a complete breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Configuration:** The attacker can manipulate the `path` configuration setting, intended to specify the ClamAV binary path, to inject malicious shell commands. This can happen when initializing the `clamscan` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Configuration Control:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the configuration options of the `clamscan` module. This might involve having control over application settings or configuration files where the path to the clamscan binary is set.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `_isClamavBinary` function in `index.js`, specifically due to the use of `execFile` with a path controlled by the user.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how a folder with a malicious command (e.g. `echo vulnerable > create.txt`) can be created and then used as the binary `path`.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `clamscan` prior to `1.3.0`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "high" attack complexity because it requires the attacker to create a folder with a specific name containing a command to be executed.
*   The Snyk advisory mentions an EPSS score of 12.68% which is in the 96th percentile, suggesting it has a notable probability of exploitation.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade the `clamscan` package to version 1.3.0 or higher.
