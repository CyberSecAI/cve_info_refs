Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7738

**Root Cause:**
- The `shiba` package uses the insecure `load()` function from the `js-yaml` library instead of the safe alternative, `safeLoad()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use of `load()` allows for the execution of arbitrary code by processing potentially malicious YAML input.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The `js-yaml` library's `load()` function is known to be vulnerable to code injection attacks when parsing untrusted YAML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Total loss of confidentiality, all resources within the impacted component are exposed.
- **Integrity:** Total loss of integrity, the attacker can modify any/all files protected by the component.
- **Availability:** Reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability are possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs only low-level privileges, such as those of a normal user.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, from anywhere on the network.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists because `shiba` uses `load()` instead of `safeLoad()` from `js-yaml`.
- There is no fixed version for `shiba` to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
- Snyk assigned the ID `SNYK-JS-SHIBA-596466` to track this vulnerability.
