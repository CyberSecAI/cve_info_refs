Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7051:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data when creating a new thread poll within the Codoforum application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input, which contains malicious JavaScript code. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the thread poll.
- **Lack of HttpOnly Flag on Session Cookie:** The session cookie of the application does not have the HttpOnly flag set, which allows the injected JavaScript code to access and potentially steal session cookies of users who view the crafted poll thread.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can use the injected JavaScript to steal session cookies of other users, including administrators. This allows them to impersonate those users and perform any actions they are authorized to do on the forum.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the input field for creating a new thread poll.
- When other users view the poll containing the injected JavaScript, their browsers execute the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the forum to create a new thread poll.
- No elevated privileges or special access are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected product is Codelogic Codoforum version 4.8.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Polina Voronina.
- A related CVE, CVE-2020-7050, is a DOM-Based XSS vulnerability in the same product.
