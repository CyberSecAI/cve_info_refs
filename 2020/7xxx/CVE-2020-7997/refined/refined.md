The provided content relates to CVE-2020-7997.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ASUS WRT-AC66U 3 router firmware version 3.0.0.4 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the "Client Name" parameter of the ASUS WRT-AC66U 3 router's web interface. The provided PoC shows how an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through this parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when accessing the router's web interface. This could lead to various malicious activities including:

*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web interface
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., credentials, cookies).
*  Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Client Name" parameter. When a user accesses a page that reflects this input (likely in the router's web interface), the injected script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must be able to submit the malicious payload to the affected parameter, usually through the device management interface. They likely need to be on the same network as the device to access the interface, though this isn't explicitly stated. The attacker does not need any special permissions or to be logged in.

The specific PoC provided is: `"><svg onload=prompt(/xss/);>`
This payload uses an SVG tag with an `onload` event handler that executes `prompt(/xss/)`. This serves as a simple way to demonstrate that arbitrary Javascript code can be executed via the XSS vulnerability.
