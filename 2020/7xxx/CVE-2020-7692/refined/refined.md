Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper implementation of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) in the `com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client` library prior to version 1.31.0.  The library's OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow did not enforce PKCE, which is recommended for native apps.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is that without PKCE, the authorization code obtained from the authorization server is not exclusively tied to the client that initiated the request. This means a malicious app could intercept or obtain the authorization code and use it to impersonate the legitimate client.
*   **Missing PKCE Implementation:** The library did not implement PKCE according to RFC 7636, specifically for native apps as specified in RFC 8252.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to protected resources on behalf of a legitimate user. By obtaining and using the authorization code, an attacker can impersonate the authorized application, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Loss:** The impact is rated as High for Confidentiality and Integrity. This means a successful exploit could result in the attacker gaining access to all the data associated with the user's account (confidentiality) and having the ability to modify data (integrity).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or Malicious App:** A malicious application on the client-side, or an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack, could intercept the authorization code.
*   **Client-Side Attack:** The attack occurs on the client-side by exploiting the vulnerability and using the stolen authorization code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Intercept or Obtain Authorization Code:** The attacker needs a way to obtain the authorization code that the legitimate application would receive. This could be done through a malicious application or a MitM attack.
*   **Client-Side Presence:** The attacker's malicious app must be able to obtain the authorization code on the client-side.
*   **No Prior Authorization:** The attacker does not require any pre-existing authorization or privileges before the attack is launched.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves upgrading the `com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client` to version 1.31.0 or higher, which introduces the correct PKCE implementation.
*   The vulnerability is classified under CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
*   The CVSS score from Snyk is 7.4 (High), while NVD has it at 9.1 (Critical).
*   The vulnerability was fixed with commit `13433cd7dd06267fc261f0b1d4764f8e3432c824` which introduced PKCE support for `AuthorizationCodeFlow`.
