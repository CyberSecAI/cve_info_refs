### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)
for more details.

#### Introduced: 3 Jul 2020

[CVE-2020-7692  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7692) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-285  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client` to version 1.31.0 or higher.

## Overview

[com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client) is a powerful and easy-to-use Java library for the OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0 authorization standards.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Authorization. PKCE support is not implemented in accordance with the RFC for OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps. Without the use of PKCE, the authorization code returned by an authorization server is not enough to guarantee that the client that issued the initial authorization request is the one that will be authorized. An attacker is able to obtain the authorization code using a malicious app on the client-side and use it to gain authorization to the protected resource.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.4 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

|  |  | # Instructions for the Keycloak OAuth2 with PKCE Command-Line Sample |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Browse Online |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | [Browse Source][browse-source], or main file [PKCESample.java][main-source]. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## Command-Line Instructions |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*Prerequisites:\*\* install [Java 7 or higher][install-java], [git][install-git], and |
|  |  | [Maven][install-maven]. You may need to set your `JAVA\_HOME`. |
|  |  | You'll also need [Docker][install-docker]. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1. Check out the sample code: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```bash |
|  |  | git clone https://github.com/google/google-oauth-java-client.git |
|  |  | cd google-oauth-java-client |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 2. Run keycloak in a docker container: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  | docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK\_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK\_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:10.0.1 |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 3. Run the sample: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```bash |
|  |  | mvn install |
|  |  | mvn exec:java -pl samples/keycloak-pkce-cmdline-sample |
|  |  | ``` |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This will open up the Keycloak login page where you can log in with the username/password specified |
|  |  | when running the Keycloak docker container above (`admin / admin`). Once you log in, the application |
|  |  | will print out a message that it successfully obtained an access token. |
|  |  |  |

## Description

![@StFS](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1756?v=4&size=48)[StFS](https://github.com/StFS)opened [on May 26, 2020](https://github.com/googleapis/google-oauth-java-client/issues/469#issue-625071777)

I've been looking for information about how to enable PKCE when using the AuthorizationCodeFlow but haven't found anything.

Am I missing something or is PKCE not supported (out of the box) by this library?
