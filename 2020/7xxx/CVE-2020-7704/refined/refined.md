Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `linux-cmdline` npm package. It arises from the way the package parses and processes command-line arguments. Specifically, it's vulnerable through "property definition by path".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that the library allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects. This is done by manipulating the path of a property being defined, specifically using `__proto__` in the path to modify the base object's prototype.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition:** The library uses a function that allows defining properties on an object based on a path provided as input. If this path contains `__proto__`, it can modify the prototype of `Object`, affecting all other JavaScript objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, the attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and make the application unusable.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios, if the application evaluates an attribute of an object and then executes it using a function like `eval()`, an attacker could inject malicious code through prototype pollution.
*   **Property Injection:** An attacker can modify properties the application relies on, including security related attributes such as admin privileges, leading to unauthorized access or altered application behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by providing crafted command-line arguments to the `linux-cmdline` library which include `__proto__` within the property path.
*   The specific proof of concept given is `linuxCmdline('__proto__.polluted=true');`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `linux-cmdline` function.
*   No prior authentication or special privileges are required, just the ability to supply input to the vulnerable function/library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced on August 14, 2020.
*   The fix involves upgrading the `linux-cmdline` package to version 1.0.1 or higher.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) by Snyk and a critical score of 9.8 by NVD.
*   The Snyk page provides a good explanation of the different types of attacks that are possible with Prototype Pollution.
