Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `inetChecksite()` function of the `systeminformation` npm package. The function improperly sanitizes user-supplied URLs before using them in a command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is that the `inetChecksite()` function constructs a command string using a user-provided URL. This URL is not sufficiently sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject shell metacharacters (like `;`, `|`, `&`, etc.) into the command that will then be executed by the system.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Although the code attempts to sanitize the URL by removing some characters and converting the string to lowercase, it does not adequately prevent command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the vulnerable application. This can lead to full system compromise, including:
    - Data breaches and exfiltration.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Denial of service.
    - Complete control over the system and its resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network/Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network. The attacker needs to send a specially crafted URL to the `inetChecksite()` function, triggering the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, likely to a server that uses the vulnerable `systeminformation` package.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `inetChecksite()` function and how to craft an injection payload within the URL parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `systeminformation` versions **prior to 4.27.11**.
- The fix in version 4.27.11 includes more aggressive sanitization of the URL string, specifically removing spaces and symbols like `$` `(` `)` `{` `}`. While this addresses the specific command injection vector, it's important to remember that input sanitization can be tricky, and a robust approach involves parameterized commands rather than string concatenation.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for this vulnerability is publicly available, indicating that it was well-understood and could be actively exploited.
- Snyk has assigned the ID **SNYK-JS-SYSTEMINFORMATION-1021909** to this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is high (8.8) because the impact is high (complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and the attack vector is network-based with low complexity.
