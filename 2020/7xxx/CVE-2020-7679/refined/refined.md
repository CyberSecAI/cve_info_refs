{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `mergeObjects` utility function in casperjs is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe Object recursive merge: The `mergeObjects` function recursively merges objects. When a source object contains a `__proto__` property, the merge function can modify the `Object.prototype`, leading to prototype pollution."
    ],
    "impact": "Prototype Pollution can lead to denial of service (DoS) by triggering JavaScript exceptions, remote code execution (RCE) by tampering with the application's source code, or property injection by polluting properties used for security checks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a crafted JSON payload with a `__proto__` property, an attacker can pollute the `Object.prototype` via the vulnerable `mergeObjects` function."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the vulnerable `mergeObjects` function, which can be done through network requests, or by injecting data into the client's environment.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs due to the unsafe recursive merge of objects where properties are copied directly. If the source object contains a `__proto__` property, this can overwrite the prototype of the Object class affecting all objects and potentially leading to different attacks like denial of service, remote code execution or property injection"
