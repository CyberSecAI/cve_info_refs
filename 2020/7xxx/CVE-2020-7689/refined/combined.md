# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

Fixes [#776](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/776)

See comments here:

[#776 (comment)](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/776#issuecomment-636496388)

The question is sort of "how much" to fix this one. I left version 2a as is, which will use all 254 bytes of the input and wrap thereafter. This patch fixes 2b only.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This probably happened while improperly applying a pathc from OpenBSD bcrypt sources.  Tests weren't so robust I guess. |

## Description

![@pool683](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60290626?v=4&size=48)[pool683](https://github.com/pool683)opened [on Jan 25, 2020](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/776#issue-555086903)

When using 64+ emoji compatibility between bcrypt <> php and bcrypt <> bcryptjs is broken, whereas bcryptjs <> php is fine.

Code to represent the issue.

```
const {spawnSync} = require('child_process');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const bcryptjs = require('bcryptjs');

let chr = '😃'; // emoji
let len = 64; // 64+
let data = chr.repeat(len);

let bcryptAHash = bcrypt.hashSync(data, bcrypt.genSaltSync(8, 'a'));
let bcryptBHash = bcrypt.hashSync(data, bcrypt.genSaltSync(8, 'b'));
let bcryptjsHash = bcryptjs.hashSync(data, bcryptjs.genSaltSync(8));
let phpHash = spawnSync("php", ["-r", "echo password_hash('"+data+"', PASSWORD_BCRYPT, ['cost' => 8]);"]).stdout.toString();

let bcrypta_php = spawnSync("php", ["-r", "echo password_verify('"+data+"', str_replace('$2a$', '$2y$', '"+bcryptAHash+"')) ? 'true' : 'false';"]).stdout.toString();
let bcryptb_php = spawnSync("php", ["-r", "echo password_verify('"+data+"', str_replace('$2b$', '$2y$', '"+bcryptBHash+"')) ? 'true' : 'false';"]).stdout.toString();
let bcryptjs_php = spawnSync("php", ["-r", "echo password_verify('"+data+"', str_replace('$2a$', '$2y$', '"+bcryptjsHash+"')) ? 'true' : 'false';"]).stdout.toString();
let php_php = spawnSync("php", ["-r", "echo password_verify('"+data+"', '"+phpHash+"') ? 'true' : 'false';"]).stdout.toString();

let bcrypta_bcrypt = bcrypt.compareSync(data, bcryptAHash).toString();
let bcryptb_bcrypt = bcrypt.compareSync(data, bcryptBHash).toString();
let bcryptjs_bcrypt = bcrypt.compareSync(data, bcryptjsHash).toString();
let php_bcrypta = bcrypt.compareSync(data, phpHash.replace("$2y$", "$2a$")).toString();
let php_bcryptb = bcrypt.compareSync(data, phpHash.replace("$2y$", "$2b$")).toString();

let bcrypta_bcryptjs = bcryptjs.compareSync(data, bcryptAHash).toString();
let bcryptjs_bcryptjs = bcryptjs.compareSync(data, bcryptjsHash).toString();
let php_bcryptjs = bcryptjs.compareSync(data, phpHash.replace("$2y$", "$2a$")).toString();

console.log("hash\\module php   bcryptjs bcrypt-a bcrypt-b");
console.log("php        ", php_php.padEnd(5, " "), php_bcryptjs.padEnd(8, " "), php_bcrypta.padEnd(8, " "), php_bcryptb.padEnd(8, " "));
console.log("bcryptjs   ", bcryptjs_php.padEnd(5, " "), bcryptjs_bcryptjs.padEnd(8, " "), bcryptjs_bcrypt.padEnd(8, " "), "".padEnd(8, " "));
console.log("bcrypt-a   ", bcrypta_php.padEnd(5, " "), bcrypta_bcryptjs.padEnd(8, " "), bcrypta_bcrypt.padEnd(8, " "), "".padEnd(8, " "));
console.log("bcrypt-b   ", bcryptb_php.padEnd(5, " "), "".padEnd(8, " "), "".padEnd(8, " "), bcryptb_bcrypt.padEnd(8, " "));

```

The output:

```
hash\module php   bcryptjs bcrypt-a bcrypt-b
php         true  true     false    false
bcryptjs    true  true     false
bcrypt-a    false false    true
bcrypt-b    false                   true

```

Fixes [#774](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/774) [#776](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/776)

Bcrypt already includes the final NUL termination character when calculating the hash. I believe that also Including those caught in the middle is a reasonable default that will help to prevent a possible class of errors. And it's a simple fix.

This patch also fixes [#776](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/issues/776), though I previously released a stand-alone patch for it. This one is preferred (by me).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| The current bcrypt implementations are fragmented. Some accept nulls and some dont. Given we use OpenBSD bcrypt as the source implementation, and UTF-8 as the canonical character encoding (which wont contain nulls) this change is controversial, OpenBSD bcrypt doesn't accept nulls in password chars. |

| The NUL character is valid in UTF-8. That's actually kind of part of the problem. This is a javascript library, and the string inputs are coming from javascript strings. If this was a C library, the controversy would be bigger, I imagine. But many (most?) javascript programmers know nothing about NUL-terminated strings.  I think that the expected behavior should be the default behavior as a general rule. It's safer. The programmer who uses this library is generally going to expect that the full input provided is going to be hashed, at least up to the well-documented 72-byte limitation.  But of course, in real-world usage, passwords are not going to contain NUL characters unless someone made a mistake or the password has been pre-processed or pre-hashed in some way. This is the use case that I'm interested in.  <https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pre-hashing-passwords>  As you can see from the OWASP recommendation, implementations that do not hash NULs have been the unexpected cause of unsafe passwords in some cases.  As such, the preferred option should generally be to limit the maximum password length. Pre-hashing of passwords should only be performed where there is a specific requirement to do so, and appropriate steps have been taking to mitigate the issues discussed above.  Well, I have a "specific requirement." I'm a big proponent of pass-phrases over passwords. And a 72-byte limitation really works against that.  Pre-hashing is a pretty common means of overcoming the limitation. Dropbox does it. (Or did it, at least. <https://dropbox.tech/security/how-dropbox-securely-stores-your-passwords>) The easier a library makes to do it safely, the better IMO.  I already have a backwards-compatible branch of this lib that takes either a string or Buffer as an input to further help to do this easily and properly. I'd love to have it merged eventually so I don't have to maintain a separate fork. This is a step towards that.  Anyway, that's my goal, use case, and argument. Thank you for your consideration. |

| The NUL character is valid in UTF-8. That's actually kind of part of the problem.  Only as NUL byte. UTF-8 is designed in such a way to avoid NUL anywhere resulting from combination of any multi-byte character.  This is a javascript library, and the string inputs are coming from javascript strings. If this was a C library, the controversy would be bigger, I imagine. But many (most?) javascript programmers know nothing about NUL-terminated strings.  This I will agree with.  I already have a backwards-compatible branch of this lib that takes either a string or Buffer as an input to further help to do this easily and properly. I'd love to have it merged eventually so I don't have to maintain a separate fork. This is a step towards that.  I would actually like that. I have been working on a Buffer input for bcrypt for some time now but it's nowhere complete.  Anyway, that's my goal, use case, and argument. Thank you for your consideration. |

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
