Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of input data length within the `bcrypt` library, specifically when the input string exceeds 255 bytes. This is related to how the library applies a patch from OpenBSD bcrypt sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Encryption:** The core issue is that the library truncates data incorrectly when the input length is greater than 255 bytes.
- **Data Truncation:**  Input data exceeding 255 bytes is not processed correctly, leading to inconsistent hashing results. Specifically, the 2b version of bcrypt was affected in this manner. The 2a version was left as is, wrapping around the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Verification Failure:** The primary impact is the potential failure of password verification. If a password longer than 255 bytes was hashed using a vulnerable version, it will not be correctly matched by the same password during verification.
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker might be able to bypass authentication if they can manipulate the input data to exploit this truncation and produce a valid hash using a different password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by supplying an input string (likely a password or passphrase) that exceeds the 255-byte limit.
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network since the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable bcrypt hashing function.
- **No Prior Authorization:** No prior authorization or user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not require any access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced due to an improper application of a patch from OpenBSD bcrypt.
-  The fix involved passing `key_len` to the bcrypt function to ensure the entire input is considered.
-  The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.0.0 of the `bcrypt` package.
- The issue is also related to how the library handles NUL characters, where some implementations accept them and some don't, further complicating the fix. The fix ensures that the full input, including NUL characters, is processed when calculating the hash.
- The maintainers initially considered the usage of NUL characters in passwords to be unintended but provided a fix that treats them as valid input, as this is the expected behavior in JavaScript libraries.
