Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7935:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient protection mechanism in the Pandora FMS File Manager, specifically the `get_file.php` script. While this script prevents direct execution of uploaded PHP files through the file manager, it does not prevent access and execution of the same files through other parts of the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload (Partial):** The File Manager allows uploading of PHP files, even though the vendor tried to block execution within the manager by not giving execution permissions.
*  **Predictable/Controllable File Path:** The uploaded file's name and path are controllable and predictable by the attacker.
*   **Insecure Directory Creation:** While the File Manager allows creating directories, the permissions are not properly set which leads to not properly secured uploaded files/directories.
*   **Accessible Upload Directory:** Vulnerable folders like `pandora_console/images/backgrounds/` are accessible from outside the File Manager and can be used to store and execute files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g. a webshell) to an accessible directory and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Authentication:** The attacker needs a Web Admin account in Pandora FMS.
2.  **File Upload:** The attacker utilizes the File Manager to upload a PHP file.
3.  **Directory Creation:** The attacker creates a directory inside `pandora_console/images/backgrounds/`.
4.  **File Storage:** The attacker stores the PHP file inside the created directory.
5.  **Code Execution:** The attacker accesses the uploaded PHP file directly via HTTP to execute the code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Admin Account:** The attacker must have a valid Web Admin account to access the File Manager.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Pandora FMS web interface.
*   **Web Request Knowledge** The attacker needs knowledge about how to construct a web request to the uploaded file to execute code.
