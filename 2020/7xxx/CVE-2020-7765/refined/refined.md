Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7765:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided information directly relates to CVE-2020-7765. The Snyk vulnerability database entry, the GitHub commit, and the associated pull request all confirm that this CVE addresses a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `@firebase/util` package.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from an unsafe recursive merge operation in the `deepExtend` function within the `deepCopy.ts` file of the `@firebase/util` package.
   - Specifically, the `deepExtend` function did not properly sanitize or validate the keys during the merging process, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects, which could then lead to prototype pollution.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects by injecting malicious properties through the `__proto__` key, which was not being sanitized properly.
   - **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The vulnerability exists because the `deepExtend` function recursively merges objects, and it failed to prevent the injection of the `__proto__` key and corresponding values during the merge.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the object prototype, an attacker could modify properties such as `toString` or `valueOf`, causing JavaScript exceptions and potentially leading to a denial of service.
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object and executes it (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker could pollute the prototype with malicious code to achieve remote code execution.
   - **Property Injection:** An attacker could pollute properties that the application relies on, including security properties such as isAdmin. By changing these properties, they could achieve elevated privileges.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can exploit it via the network by crafting malicious input that contains `__proto__` properties, especially when the `deepExtend` function is used on data coming from an untrusted source.
   - **Client-Side:** Since it's in a javascript library, the vulnerability can be exploited on the client side, if the client-side application uses the `deepExtend` function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to control input:** The attacker needs the ability to control at least part of the input that is passed to the `deepExtend` function. This is common in many applications where external data is merged with existing objects.
   - **No special privileges required:** An attacker does not need any prior authorization to carry out this attack.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by:
   - Adding a check to prevent merging of the `__proto__` property in the `deepExtend` function.
   - Using a `isValidKey` function to ensure that the `__proto__` key is not merged.
   - The fix was released in `@firebase/util` version 0.3.4.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The Snyk vulnerability report provides a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The pull request #4001 on GitHub highlights the code changes made to fix this issue, which includes the fix to not extend `__proto__` and the implementation of the `isValidKey` function, as well as the relevant tests to ensure the fix works as intended.
*   The changeset included in the pull request indicates that this fix is included in multiple packages of the firebase-js-sdk.
*   The github commit page shows the actual code changes that were introduced by the pull request to fix the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-7765 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `@firebase/util` package that could lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection. This vulnerability is caused by an unsafe recursive merge function (`deepExtend`) that did not validate keys against the `__proto__` property. The fix is to prevent merging of the `__proto__` property.
