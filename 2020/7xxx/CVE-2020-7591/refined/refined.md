- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the improper implementation of the single sign-on feature ("Allow logon without password") in vulnerable versions of the SIPORT MP product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass (CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication). The single sign-on feature, when enabled, does not properly validate user identity, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate other users of the system, potentially including administrative users. This impersonation enables the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the compromised user, including administrative tasks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based (AV:N). It requires a low level of access privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected system and a low level of access privileges on the system. This is based on CVSS vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C.
