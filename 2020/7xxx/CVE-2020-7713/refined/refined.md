Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `arr-flatten-unflatten` npm package. Specifically, the `unflatten` function in this package is vulnerable because it allows an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of the base JavaScript `Object` class. This is achieved through the `unflatten` function not properly sanitizing input allowing the injection of properties via the `__proto__` attribute.
*   **Unsafe Object Merging:** The vulnerability is described as stemming from "property definition by path", where an attacker controls the path and sets it to `__proto__.myValue`, assigning the `myValue` to the prototype.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `unflatten` function does not validate the input it receives, allowing it to process and execute harmful input such as `{'__proto__.polluted':true}`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can alter critical object functions like `toString` or `valueOf`, causing the application to crash and become unavailable.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application executes code based on object attributes, a polluted prototype may enable an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code, depending on how the polluted attributes are used in the application code (e.g., through `eval`).
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties to modify the behavior or security checks of an application. This includes manipulating security-related properties, such as authentication tokens or admin privilege checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is accessible through the network, making it remotely exploitable. The attacker can potentially access the vulnerable endpoint via a network request.
*   **Input Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerable `unflatten` function with crafted input that includes the `__proto__` attribute to modify the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any prior privileges or special access to exploit this vulnerability. They can exploit this with a specially crafted JSON object in the vulnerable component.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send an input to the vulnerable function in the `arr-flatten-unflatten` package. This may require access to the application's API or other entry points depending on how the library is used by an application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `arr-flatten-unflatten` package
*   The Snyk security team has a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate the exploit.
*   Snyk's CVSS score is 7.5 (High) with the following vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
*   NVD has assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical)
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated through various techniques including freezing the prototype, using schema validation for JSON input, avoiding unsafe merges, creating prototype-less objects, or using `Map` instead of `Object`.
