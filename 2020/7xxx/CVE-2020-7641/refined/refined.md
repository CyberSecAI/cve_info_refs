Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7641:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue in the `grunt-util-property` package. The `call` function within this package can be exploited to modify the properties of `Object.prototype` by using a `__proto__` payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is that the `call` function doesn't properly sanitize or validate its inputs, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is done by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute.
*   **Unsafe Property Definition:** The vulnerability stems from how the `call` function handles property setting based on user-controlled input (the `path` argument)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, the attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and potentially crash the application. For example, modifying `toString` to an integer would break any code using `someobject.toString()`.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates a property of an object using `eval()`, an attacker can pollute the prototype with malicious code which will then be executed leading to RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** The attacker can modify critical properties such as security-related flags (e.g., `isAdmin`) on the `Object.prototype` which can lead to privilege escalation or security bypass.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side:** The attacks occur on the client side (e.g., within a web browser) where the JavaScript code is executed.
*   **Payload:** The attacker injects a `__proto__` payload into the `call` function of `grunt-util-property`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters, particularly the `path` argument, passed to the vulnerable `call` function within the `grunt-util-property` library.
*   No special access or privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to use the `__proto__` payload to modify the `toString` function of `Object.prototype`.
*   The vulnerability can be categorized under CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution').
*   The affected versions of the `grunt-util-property` package are all versions. There is no fixed version available.
* The Snyk analysis notes the vulnerability is a medium severity (4) with a local attack vector and high complexity.  NVD however rates the vulnerability as high severity (7.8).
*   The Snyk analysis also provides various mitigation methods including freezing the prototype, validating JSON input, avoiding unsafe recursive merges, using objects without prototypes, and using `Map` instead of `Object`.
