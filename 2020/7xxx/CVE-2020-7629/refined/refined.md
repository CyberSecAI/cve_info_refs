{
  "CVE-2020-7629": {
    "Description": "The install-package npm package before 0.4.1 is vulnerable to command injection. The argument `options` can be controlled by users without any sanitization.",
    "Root cause": "The `options` argument, which is used in the `execFileP` function, is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
     "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used.",
    "Attack vectors": "By passing unsanitized input through the `options` argument.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `options` argument passed to the `install` function. This could be via a user-controlled input that ends up in the `options` parameter.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in the `install-package` npm package before version 0.4.1. The proof-of-concept code provided demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting a command using the options argument. This vulnerability can lead to complete system compromise, allowing an attacker to control the impacted environment."
