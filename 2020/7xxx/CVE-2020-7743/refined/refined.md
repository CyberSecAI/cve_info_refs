Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7743:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unsafe recursive merge function (`deepExtend`) within the `mathjs` library. This function is used when configuration updates are applied.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `deepExtend` function recursively merges objects. When a source object contains a property named `__proto__` (or `constructor` or `prototype`), this property can be used to modify the prototype of all objects, leading to prototype pollution.
- **Unsafe Object Recursive Merge:** The recursive merge function does not properly sanitize or validate the input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties of `Object.prototype` used implicitly by various operations (like `toString` or `valueOf`), the application can fail, causing a DoS.
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In cases where the code evaluates specific attributes of an object (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker can inject malicious code via prototype pollution.
  - **Property Injection:** An attacker can pollute properties that the application relies on for informative values, such as security properties (e.g. `isAdmin`), potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is **network**, meaning that the vulnerable component is reachable over a network, and the set of possible attackers extends to the entire internet.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious input during the configuration update process that will trigger the `deepExtend` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability
- They need to be able to influence the input used in the configuration updates. This could be achieved by manipulating JSON data supplied in a configuration update.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in `mathjs` versions prior to 7.5.1, in `org.webjars:mathjs` versions before 10.4.1 , in `org.webjars.npm:mathjs` versions before 9.4.4 and in `org.webjars.bower:mathjs`. There is no fixed version for `org.webjars.bower:mathjs`
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `ecb80514e80bce4e6ec7e71db8ff79954f07c57e`. The fix involves adding a check to prevent properties present in the `Object.prototype` or `Function.prototype` from being merged into the target object.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.3 (High).

**Mitigation:**
The Snyk articles suggest the following ways to prevent prototype pollution:

1. Freeze the prototype by using `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)`.
2. Require schema validation of JSON inputs.
3. Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.
4. Use objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`).
5. Use `Map` instead of `Object`
