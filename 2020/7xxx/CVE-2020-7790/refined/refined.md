Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7790:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling URLs in the `file://` protocol within the `spatie/browsershot` library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary File Read: By manipulating the URL parameter to point to a local file using the `file://` protocol, an attacker can force the application to read the content of that file and include it in the generated PDF or image.
- Directory traversal is implied as a potential method to access files outside the intended directories

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by reading arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who can control the URL that is processed by `browsershot`. The attacker can specify a malicious URL with the `file://` protocol pointing to any file on the server's filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the URL that is processed by `browsershot`.
- No special privileges or user interaction is needed. The attacker only needs to be able to make the system process a malicious URL, making it a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable package is `spatie/browsershot` versions >=0.0.0 and <3.40.1.
- The fix involves upgrading to version 3.40.1 or higher.
- The vulnerability was introduced on November 4, 2020, and disclosed on November 4, 2020.

- CVSS v3.1 score is 5.3 (Medium) with Network attack vector, Low complexity, no privileges required and no user interaction.
- The CVE is also categorized as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory).
