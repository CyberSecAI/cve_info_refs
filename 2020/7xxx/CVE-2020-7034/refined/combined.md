Original Release Date: April 23, 2021

Last Revised: May 19, 2021

Number: ASA-2021-031

Overall Severity Classification: High

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

## 1. Overview:

Avaya Session Border Controller for Enterprise provides all the functionality required for an enterprise to terminate SIP trunks without the complexity and higher price associated with typical SBCs and scales up to 2,000 simultaneous sessions per server.

A command injection vulnerability in Avaya Session Border Controller for Enterprise could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to send specially crafted messages and execute arbitrary commands with the affected system privileges. This issue has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2020-7034](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7034).

Avaya would like to thank Ben Leonard-Lagarde, Frederick Sibley-Calder, and Lucas Fedyniak-Hopes of Modux for reporting these issues.

## 2. Avaya Products affected:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Session Border Controller for Enterprise | 7.2 through 7.2.2.3, 8.0 through 8.1.1.x | For 7.2.x, upgrade to 7.2.2.4 or later. For 8.x, upgrade to 8.1.2.0 or later. |  |

**Recommended Actions for Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends following networking and
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs,
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions.
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya
action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but the System Product operating system or
application should not be modified unless the change is
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may
void the Avaya product service contract.

### CVSS Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSS base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSS scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).
