The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, and it does contain information about CVE-2020-7906.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsigned binaries were included in the Windows installer for Rider.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of digital signatures on the binaries within the Rider Windows installer. This allows for the possibility of malicious actors tampering with the binaries.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially replace the unsigned binaries with malicious ones, leading to the installation of compromised software. This could result in various forms of malware infection, including data theft, remote access, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves the distribution of a tampered Rider installer containing malicious, unsigned binaries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to intercept and modify the Rider installer before it is downloaded by the user. This could involve compromising the distribution channels or performing a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker also needs to be able to create malicious binaries to replace the legitimate ones.
