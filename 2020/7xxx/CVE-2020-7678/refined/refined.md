Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7678:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the "params" argument within the `module` function of the `node-import` package. This user-controlled input is directly passed to the `eval` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the use of `eval` with unsanitized user input, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The absence of any input validation or sanitization on the `params` argument makes the application vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the vulnerable `node-import` package is used.
- **Confidentiality Impact (High):** Total loss of confidentiality leading to the attacker gaining access to all resources on the system
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** Data modification is possible with limited control of the attacker on the consequence of the modification.
- **Availability Impact (Low):** Reduced performance or interruptions in service are possible but are limited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely, over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any existing privileges or access to the system.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack can be executed without any user interaction.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can be located remotely and exploit the vulnerability via network requests.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-7678 is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the `node-import` package due to the usage of `eval` with unsanitized user-controlled input. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with no privileges and no user interaction.
