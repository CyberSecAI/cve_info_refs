Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-7363:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is related to how various mobile browsers handle URL redirects and updates in the address bar. By manipulating the timing of page loads and address bar refreshes using JavaScript, an attacker can display a spoofed URL in the address bar while the content of the page comes from a different, potentially malicious source.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the address bar, leading users to believe they are on a trusted site when they are not.
    *   **Timing Issues:** The vulnerabilities rely on manipulating the timing of page loads and address bar updates using JavaScript's `setInterval`, `document.location` and `window.open` to execute redirects without the address bar updating immediately.
    *   **Port Handling:** Some browsers (e.g., Safari) preserve the address bar even when the URL is requested over an arbitrary port, especially if the port is not explicitly displayed, which enhances the spoofing.
    *  **Data Scheme Handling:** Some browsers (e.g., Opera) can be tricked into address bar spoofing by using the data scheme in combination with an arbitrary URL.
  * **Base64 encoded content:** Some browsers are vulnerable to spoofing by first displaying base64 encoded content and then changing location via javascript.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Successful exploitation can make phishing attacks more effective by displaying a trusted URL in the address bar, making it more likely for victims to enter credentials or download malware.
    *   **User Deception:** Users are tricked into trusting malicious content or pop-ups due to the misleading address bar.
    *   **Bypassing Anti-Phishing Measures:** Since the vulnerability exploits a specific browser feature, it can bypass traditional anti-phishing solutions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website containing JavaScript code that triggers the spoofing vulnerability.
    *   **Phishing:** Victims are lured to the malicious website through phishing emails, text messages, or social media posts.
    *   **Pop-ups**: Pop-ups that appear to come from a trusted website due to the spoofing vulnerability can be used to perform malicious actions.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers must be able to host a webpage with malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to employ social engineering tactics to persuade users to visit the malicious website.
    *   **Javascript knowledge:** The attacker needs to be proficient with Javascript to manipulate the timing of page loads and address bar updates.

**Specific Vulnerabilities and Proof of Concepts (POCs):**

The document provides several POCs, each demonstrating a different approach to address bar spoofing on different browsers:

*   **Vulnerability 1 (Safari):** Uses `setInterval` to repeatedly reload a spoofed URL with an arbitrary port, preventing the user from noticing the redirection.
*   **Vulnerability 2 (Yandex/Opera):** Uses `window.open` and `window.stop` to open a spoofed URL in a new window while overwriting the content with a deceptive message.
*   **Vulnerability 3 (UC Browser/Opera):** Similar to Vulnerability 1 but uses `document.location` and a different interval to achieve the spoof.
*   **Vulnerability 4 (Opera iOS):** Uses a data scheme followed by an arbitrary URL to trigger address bar spoofing.
*   **Vulnerability 5 (Multiple browsers):** Loads base64 encoded content and redirects the page to a spoofed location via JavaScript

**Affected Browsers:**

The following browsers and versions were affected:

*   UC Browser (Android)
*   Opera Mini (Android)
*   Opera Touch (iOS)
*   Yandex Browser (Android)
*   Bolt Browser (iOS)
*   RITS Browser (Android)
*   Safari (iOS)

**Mitigation:**

*   **Browser Updates:** Applying browser updates and patches released by the respective vendors is the primary method of mitigation.
*   **User Awareness:** Being cautious about clicking on links from unknown or untrusted sources is critical.
*   **Avoid Untrusted Websites**: Users should avoid navigating to websites that they deem untrustworthy.
*   **Developer Best Practices:** Developers of mobile browsers should ensure proper URL handling and prevent timing-based spoofing techniques by enforcing that address bar and page content are always synchronised.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by Rafay Baloch.
* Tod Beardsley of Rapid7 assisted in the coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
* Some browser vendors were slow to respond or issue fixes.
