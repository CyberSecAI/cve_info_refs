Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-7387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `AdxAdmin` component of Sage X3. Specifically, a flaw in the authentication and command protocol used by the `AdxDSrv.exe` service allows for unauthorized information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By sending a specific byte sequence (0x09) instead of the expected start of the authentication sequence (0x6a), an attacker can retrieve the installation directory path of Sage X3 without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The most direct impact is the exposure of the Sage X3 installation path.
*   **Facilitates Further Exploitation:** This vulnerability serves as a critical stepping stone for exploiting CVE-2020-7388 (Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution). Knowing the installation path is necessary to specify the location for the execution of malicious commands via CVE-2020-7388.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted network packets to the `AdxDSrv.exe` service on the default port TCP/1818 (or a custom port if changed).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the machine running the vulnerable `AdxDSrv.exe` service. This service is typically used for remote administration, so access is often possible on internal networks, and potentially from outside if exposed.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without needing any prior authentication to the service.
