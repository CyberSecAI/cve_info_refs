Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Parallels 13 update process uses cleartext HTTP, which allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Communication:** The application fetches update information via HTTP instead of HTTPS, leaving the communication vulnerable to interception and modification.
- **Lack of Authenticity Verification:** The application does not verify the authenticity of the downloaded updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A successful MITM attack allows the attacker to replace the legitimate update file with a malicious one, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user installing the update.
- **Arbitrary Application Download:** Attackers can trick the user into downloading and installing any application of their choice, bypassing security measures.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** An attacker can display custom text and links within the update pop-up to further trick the user into installing malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positioned on the network between the user and the Parallels update server can intercept and modify the HTTP traffic.
- **Update Pop-up:** The attack is triggered when the application displays the update pop-up window. The application sends an HTTP request to a specific URL on the Parallels website for update information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target or in a position to intercept network traffic between the target and the Parallels update server.
- **Interception Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP traffic.

**Additional Details**
- The update pop-up makes an HTTP request to "http://update.parallels.com/desktop/v13/parallels/parallels\_updates.xml".
- The attacker can modify the path for the downloaded updates within the XML response to point to malicious files.
