{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-7934",
  "related": true,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering it in search results.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of any user that triggers the XSS payload. This can lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement, potentially leading to RCE by chaining the exploit with features like Gogo Shell and Groovy Script Commands.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The attacker must have a valid account, modify their first, middle, or last name fields to inject the payload via the MyAccountPortlet. The XSS payload is then executed when another user searches for and views the 'infected' user's profile."
      ],
        "requiredCapabilities": [
           "A valid user account with the ability to modify their own user profile fields (first, middle, or last name). The user account also needs to be searchable by other users. "
        ],
      "details": "The vulnerability exists in Liferay Portal versions 7.1.0 through 7.2.1 GA2, where the 'First Name', 'Middle Name', and 'Last Name' fields for user accounts are vulnerable to a Stored XSS issue. An attacker modifies these fields via MyAccountPortlet and the injected payload is stored in the database. When a user performs a search that includes the 'infected' user, the XSS payload executes within that user's context."
