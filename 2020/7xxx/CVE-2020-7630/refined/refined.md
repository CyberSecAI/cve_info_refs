Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `git-add-remote` npm package is vulnerable to command injection.
- The `name` argument passed to the `addRemote` function is not sanitized before being used in a `cp.exec` call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `name` argument allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `git remote add` command executed by the `cp.exec` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable package is used.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High - the attacker can gain access to all resources within the impacted component.
- **Integrity Impact:** None.
- **Availability Impact:** None.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can control the `name` parameter when calling the vulnerable function which then is passed to `cp.exec` without sanitization

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the `name` argument passed to the vulnerable function within the `git-add-remote` package. This could happen if the application using this package takes user-supplied data and uses it as the name of a remote repository.
- No privileges are needed.
- No user interaction is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The Snyk vulnerability report provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the command injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `git-add-remote` package.
- Snyk's analysis gives the CVSS v3.1 base score as 5.9 (Medium), while NVD gives 9.8 (Critical), indicating a high level of concern.
- The `Attack Complexity (AC)` is High because a successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control, however, given the simplicity of exploitation it could be argued that the AC should be low.
- The `Attack Vector (AV)` is Network, which means that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
