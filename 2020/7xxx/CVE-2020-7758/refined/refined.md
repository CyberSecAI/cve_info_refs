Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Path Traversal issue in the `browserless-chrome` package.
*   User-supplied input from the `workspace` endpoint is used to construct a file path (`filePath`) without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input when creating file paths, allowing an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended workspace.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the file `/src/routes.ts`, where the code constructs a file path using `path.join(workspaceDir, file)` without properly validating the `file` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting the path traversal, an attacker can access any file on the server's file system that the `browserless-chrome` process has permission to read. This includes sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`, application source code, configuration files, and private keys.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data on the server's file system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers can send a crafted HTTP request to the `/workspace` endpoint with a malicious `file` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `browserless-chrome` service, usually via HTTP on a specified port.
*   **No Authentication Required**: No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is in `src/routes.ts` at line 175.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure the constructed `filePath` includes the `workspaceDir`.  This is visible in the diff provided in the github.com content, where the added code checks `if (!filePath.includes(workspaceDir))`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows an example of how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl` by accessing `/workspace/../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Additional details:**

*   Snyk's analysis provides a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) with a Network attack vector, Low complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, and High confidentiality impact.
*   A patch was released, and a fixed version is available at tag `1.40.2-chrome-stable` on GitHub, although it was noted that npm releases were stopped. The fix is to ensure that the filepath remains inside the intended workspace directory.
