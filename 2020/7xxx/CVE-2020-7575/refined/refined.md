- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web server access log page of the affected devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code via specially crafted GET requests, which can be executed later by other users, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of their web sessions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system through specially crafted GET requests to the web server access log page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the affected system is required, but no system privileges are needed for successful exploitation. The attacker needs to craft malicious GET requests.
