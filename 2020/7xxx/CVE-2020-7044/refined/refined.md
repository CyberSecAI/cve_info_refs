Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an off-by-one error in the WASSP (Wide Area Submerged Systems Protocol) dissector of Wireshark. The dissector does not properly validate the length field in WASSP packets, which leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a global-buffer-overflow in the `dissect_wassp_sub_tlv` function within the WASSP dissector. This occurs because the dissector doesn't correctly handle length parameters when parsing Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the Wireshark application.
- **Potential Denial of Service:** By injecting a malformed packet, an attacker can cause Wireshark to terminate, leading to a denial of service for the user trying to analyze network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Packet Injection:** Attackers can inject a malformed WASSP packet onto the network.
- **Malformed Trace File:** Attackers can convince a user to open a specially crafted packet trace file containing a malformed WASSP packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to inject packets into the network traffic being captured by Wireshark.
- **File Access:** Alternatively, an attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious packet trace file to the user of Wireshark.
- **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation does not require special privileges on the victim system.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `epan/dissectors/packet-wassp.c`.
- The fix involves checking the length field using `>=` and `<=` instead of `>` and `<` operators to avoid off-by-one errors.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in Wireshark version 3.1.0.
- Affected Wireshark versions include 3.2.x before 3.2.1.
- The vulnerability is tracked by Wireshark as wnpa-sec-2020-01 and Bug 16324.

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade to Wireshark 3.2.1 or later.

This information provides more technical details than the original CVE description, specifying the vulnerable function, the type of error, and the attack vectors. It also highlights that a patch addresses the issue by correcting off-by-one errors, making the length check inclusive with `>=` and `<=`.
