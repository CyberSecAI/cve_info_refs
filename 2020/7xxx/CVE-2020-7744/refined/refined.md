{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-7744",
    "description": "The Mintegral SDK, a popular mobile app advertising SDK for iOS and Android, contains malicious functionality.  On iOS, it can perform excessive data collection, including intercepting all HTTP requests, logging URLs and HTTP headers (potentially including authorization tokens), and can perform ad attribution fraud. It also has a backdoor allowing remote code execution. On Android, it can track downloads from Google URLs, file downloads, email attachments, Google Docs links, and all apk downloads. The collected data is sent to Mintegral's servers. This behavior is hidden by obfuscation and anti-debug measures.",
    "affected_components": [
      {
        "name": "Mintegral SDK",
        "platforms": [
          "iOS",
          "Android"
         ],
        "versions": [
            "All versions of MintegralAdSDK prior to 6.5.0.0 on iOS",
            "versions 5.5.1 and above on iOS",
           "Android SDK Distributed in com.mintegral.msdk:alphab"
          ]
      }
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Mintegral SDK contains malicious code that performs unauthorized data collection and allows remote code execution. The SDK uses techniques such as method swizzling, custom URL protocols, and proprietary encoding schemes to hide its behavior and bypass security measures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive data collection",
      "Ad attribution fraud",
       "Remote code execution",
      "Obfuscation",
      "Anti-debug/anti-proxy techniques",
      "Method Swizzling",
       "Insecure handling of URLs, network requests and system events"
    ],
    "impact": "The Mintegral SDK's malicious activities could lead to information leakage, remote code execution, ad fraud, privacy violation, and device compromise. Sensitive data, including API tokens and user information, could be exposed. Remote code execution could allow an attacker to completely control the device and steal data. Also, it might violate app store policies due to unexpected behavior.  The SDK's behaviour bypasses developers and end-users consent, since the collection occurs even if the developer did not enable it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The SDK is included in mobile applications",
         "Remote exploitation via malicious ads",
       "Network interception",
       "Manipulated URLs and network requests"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with control over the Mintegral ad network infrastructure can execute arbitrary code on iOS devices.  For data exfiltration, access to the network, including a man-in-the-middle position to intercept requests is needed, but also attackers might leverage the infrastructure to inject malicious javascript into ads. For the Android part, the malicious activity is done by the app with the malicious SDK, so no specific external attacker is needed.",
     "remediation": "Avoid using all malicious instances of the `com.mintegral.msdk:alphab` package.  For iOS, update to version 6.6.0.0 or later."
