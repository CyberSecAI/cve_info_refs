Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7782

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `spritesheet-js` package. This package uses the `platform-command` package which is also vulnerable. The vulnerability is triggered due to insecure handling of user-provided input within the `spritesheet-js` library. Specifically, the `scale` option, which is intended to be a percentage, is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core issue is that the application constructs shell commands using unsanitized user input. This makes it vulnerable to command injection attacks.
*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The `scale` option is not validated and sanitized before being used in command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can gain full control of the system, potentially stealing sensitive data, modifying files, and causing denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and accessible over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any prior authorization to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction.
*   **Knowledge of `spritesheet-js` Options:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in the `scale` option to inject commands.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `lib/generator.js` file of the `spritesheet-js` package, specifically at line 32.
*   The `scale` option in the `spritesheet-js` library, which is intended to handle scaling percentages, is vulnerable. By providing malicious input in the `scale` parameter an attacker can execute commands.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```javascript
var a = require("spritesheet-js");
a('./', { scale:"& touch JHU #",trim:true});
```
This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject the command `touch JHU` by providing `& touch JHU #` as the `scale` option to the `spritesheet-js` function.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was disclosed on December 4, 2020, and first added by Snyk.
*   The vulnerability has a critical CVSS score of 9.8.
*   There is no fixed version of the `spritesheet-js` package.
*   Snyk has a proof of concept and detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability
