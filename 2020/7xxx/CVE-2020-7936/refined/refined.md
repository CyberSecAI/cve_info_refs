Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-7936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on URLs, specifically the `isURLInPortal` check. This check, designed to prevent linking to external sites, could be tricked into accepting malicious links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirection: The primary vulnerability is an open redirection issue. This flaw exists on the login form and potentially in other areas where redirects are performed within the application.
- Insufficient URL Validation: The `isURLInPortal` check fails to properly validate URLs, allowing malicious URLs to bypass the check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites. This could lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other forms of malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URLs, likely in the redirect parameters on the login form or other redirect points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that bypasses the `isURLInPortal` check. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the open redirection on the login form.
