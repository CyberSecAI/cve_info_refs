Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7611:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Micronaut HTTP client not properly validating request headers that are passed to it. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and even full HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTTP Request Header Injection:** The core weakness is the client's failure to sanitize or validate header values before using them in an HTTP request. This allows for the insertion of Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters, which can then be interpreted as separate headers or even the start of a new HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) variant:** By injecting a complete HTTP request, an attacker can force the vulnerable application to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external resources.
- **Full Control over HTTP Body:**  Attackers can control the content of the injected requests, allowing them to send arbitrary data to internal services.
- **Manipulation of Headers and Body**: The attacker is able to control the entirety of the HTTP body for their custom requests.
- **Potential for further attacks**: This vulnerability can be a stepping stone to other attacks, depending on the internal services that can be reached.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-supplied Data:** The primary attack vector is through user-provided data that is not an HTTP header, such as query parameters or form data, being used to set HTTP headers in requests made by the vulnerable application's HTTP client.
-  **Specifically, values passed as a header value to the client via @QueryValue can be manipulated.**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and control the parameters.
- **No Authentication Required**: This vulnerability can be exploited without the need for user authentication.
- **No User Interaction Required**: The attacker doesn't need any action from other users for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `io.micronaut:micronaut-http-client` versions `<= 1.2.10, 1.3.1`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in `1.2.11` and `1.3.2` and above.
- The vulnerability was originally reported by  `@JLLeitschuh`.
- The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker could use a crafted query parameter to inject multiple HTTP requests.
- Snyk gives this vulnerability a severity rating of "medium", while NVD rates it as "critical".
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-113, which is "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request Header Injection')".
