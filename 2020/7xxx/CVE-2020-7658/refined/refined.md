Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7658:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers in the `meinheld` Python WSGI web server. Specifically, the server does not properly handle duplicate `Content-Length` headers and incorrectly parses invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The primary vulnerability is HTTP Request Smuggling, which arises from the server's flawed header parsing.
*   **Duplicate Content-Length Headers:** The server fails to handle duplicate `Content-Length` headers correctly.
*   **Invalid Transfer-Encoding Headers:** The server parses invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers as valid, potentially allowing for CL:TE or TE:CL smuggling attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Web-cache poisoning:** An attacker can manipulate HTTP responses to poison a web cache.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The ability to manipulate responses can be leveraged for XSS attacks.
*   **Sensitive information disclosure:** An attacker may obtain sensitive information from requests other than their own.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through network requests, specifically crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable at the protocol level, making it accessible across network hops.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker can be located anywhere on the network (or internet) that can reach the vulnerable server.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability as the attack is done at the protocol level.
*   No user interaction is required.
*   The attacker must have the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `meinheld` versions prior to 1.0.2.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed on May 17, 2020, and published on May 21, 2020.
*   Snyk provides a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The Snyk vulnerability database assigned it the ID SNYK-PYTHON-MEINHELD-569140.
*   The recommended fix is to upgrade `meinheld` to version 1.0.2 or higher.
