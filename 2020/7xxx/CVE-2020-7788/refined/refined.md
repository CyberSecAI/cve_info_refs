Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7788:

**Vulnerability:** Prototype Pollution

**Root Cause:**
The `ini` package, when parsing a specially crafted INI file, doesn't properly sanitize or validate keys, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This occurs when the parser encounters the `__proto__` property in the input, either as a section name, a key, or a part of a nested key path, which is then used to modify the prototype.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of input validation:** The `ini.parse` function doesn't sanitize or block the `__proto__` key, which is a special property used to access an object's prototype.
*   **Unsafe object modification:** The parser directly assigns properties based on the input, without verifying that the properties should be allowed on the prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions and disrupt application functionality. For example, overwriting `toString` to a non-function value.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific scenarios, if the application uses properties from the prototype to execute code (`eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker can inject malicious code by polluting the prototype.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or overwrite properties used by the application for various purposes, including security-sensitive properties like admin flags or tokens, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious INI File:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted INI file with the `__proto__` property as a section name, key, or within a key path.
*   **Parsing with `ini.parse`:** The vulnerable application uses the `ini.parse` function to parse the malicious INI file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a malicious INI file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an INI file to the application. This could be achieved by compromising an upstream service, via a file upload vulnerability, or by controlling an external configuration source.
*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need to be authorized on the system prior to attack to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the `ini.parse` function handles the `__proto__` property when processing the INI data. The parser recursively assigns properties based on the INI file. The parser recursively descends into the data structure, and when `__proto__` is found as a key or part of a key path, properties are added to the actual `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how injecting the `__proto__` property in the input INI file can lead to prototype pollution.

**Fix:**
The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.6 by not allowing `__proto__` as a key.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability can affect applications running on server-side (Node.js) environments, potentially causing DoS, RCE, or property injection.
*   Prototype pollution vulnerabilities can have serious security consequences and should be addressed promptly.
*   The Snyk information also mentions different ways that prototype pollution can occur, such as unsafe recursive object merges and property definitions by path.
