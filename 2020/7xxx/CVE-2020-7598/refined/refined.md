Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7598:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `minimist` library's improper handling of input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the library to add or modify properties of `Object.prototype`. This is known as prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The `minimist` library was susceptible to prototype pollution, where an attacker can inject properties into JavaScript's base object prototype. Specifically, it could be tricked using `constructor` or `__proto__` payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype` to invalid values like integers, the application can crash due to type mismatch when these functions are called, leading to a DoS.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the application evaluates object properties and then executes the result with `eval()`, attackers could achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious code into `Object.prototype`.
*   **Property Injection:**  Attackers can inject or modify existing application properties relied upon by the codebase, potentially altering application logic. For example, if an attacker pollutes a user's privilege check property, like `isAdmin` and sets it to true, they can achieve admin privileges.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker might be able to achieve some level of information disclosure.
*   **Integrity Impact:** Attackers can modify object properties which could tamper with application behaviour.
*   **Availability Impact:** Code may fail leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is exposed on the network, which enables remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker can be an external entity exploiting a network facing application or an internal attacker able to influence data.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authorization or privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   No user interaction is required from the target.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability arises from how `minimist` parses command-line arguments. It does not properly sanitize the input values before assigning them to properties, allowing attackers to control the path.
*   The vulnerability occurs when parsing command line arguments, which contain payloads like `--__proto__.injected0 value0` or `--constructor.prototype.injected1 value1`.
*   The vulnerability is present in affected versions when defining property values on an object based on a path. For example, calling `theFunction(object, path, value)`, and the attacker can control the value of "path" and set it to `__proto__.myValue`. This will set the `myValue` property on the prototype of the class of the object.
*   Unsafe recursive merge can also cause this vulnerability by passing the source object contains a property named `__proto__` defined with `Object.defineProperty()` to a recursive merge function which recurses to copy properties on the `Object` prototype.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in `minimist` versions `<0.2.1` and `>=1.0.0 <1.2.3`.
*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The `snyk.io` content provides mitigations, including freezing the prototype with `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`, requiring JSON schema validation, avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions, using objects without prototypes, and using `Map` instead of `Object`.

The SUSE content also mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in nodejs versions, and provides details on updated packages and advisories.
