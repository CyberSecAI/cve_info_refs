# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

6.5 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting)

## Package

io.jooby:jooby-netty
(Java, Maven, Gradle)

## Affected versions

< 2.2.1

## Patched versions

2.2.1

## Description

### Impact

* Cross Site Scripting
* Cache Poisoning
* Page Hijacking

### Patches

This was fixed in version `2.2.1`.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to update, ensure that user supplied data isn't able to flow to HTTP headers. If it does, pre-sanitize for CRLF characters.

### References

##### [CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)

I've been poking at libraries to see if they are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting and Jooby is my third case of finding this vulnerability.

### Root Cause

This roots cause back to this line in the Jooby codebase:

[jooby/modules/jooby-netty/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/netty/NettyContext.java](https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/blob/93cfc80aa20c188f71a442ea7a1827da380e1c27/modules/jooby-netty/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/netty/NettyContext.java#L102)

Line 102
in
[93cfc80](/jooby-project/jooby/commit/93cfc80aa20c188f71a442ea7a1827da380e1c27)

|  | final DefaultHttpHeaders setHeaders = new DefaultHttpHeaders(false); |
| --- | --- |

The `DefaultHttpHeaders` takes a parameter `validate` which, when `true` (as it is for the no-arg constructor) validates that the header isn't being abused to do HTTP Response Splitting.

### Reported By

This vulnerability was reported by [@JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/JLLeitschuh))

### For more information

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-7622

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
