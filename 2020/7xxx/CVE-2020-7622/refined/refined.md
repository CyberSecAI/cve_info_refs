Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `DefaultHttpHeaders` class in the `io.jooby:jooby-netty` library being initialized without header validation. This is due to using `new DefaultHttpHeaders(false)` instead of `new DefaultHttpHeaders(true)`. The boolean parameter controls whether the header is validated against HTTP Response Splitting attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The core issue is the lack of validation for CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences in HTTP headers. This allows an attacker to inject malicious headers into the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript code via crafted headers.
- **Cache Poisoning:** The attacker can manipulate the response in a way that causes a cache to store incorrect content.
- **Page Hijacking:** The attacker can redirect a victim to a malicious page.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker can inject CRLF characters into HTTP headers through user-supplied data or any input that is not sanitized before being used to construct the HTTP header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the data that is used in constructing HTTP response headers in an application that is using vulnerable versions of io.jooby:jooby-netty
- No specific privileges are required, and the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** `io.jooby:jooby-netty` versions prior to 1.6.9, and versions between 2.0.0 and 2.2.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions 1.6.9 and 2.2.1 or higher.
*   **CVSS Score:** Snyk provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium), while NVD gives a critical score of 9.8.
*   **Mitigation:** If upgrading is not an option, user-supplied data flowing into HTTP headers must be sanitized to remove CRLF characters.
*   **Reported By:** Jonathan Leitschuh reported this vulnerability.
*   **Commit Fix:** The commit [b66e3342cf95205324023cfdf2cb5811e8a6dcf4](https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/commit/b66e3342cf95205324023cfdf2cb5811e8a6dcf4) addresses the issue by setting `DefaultHttpHeaders` with validation enabled.
