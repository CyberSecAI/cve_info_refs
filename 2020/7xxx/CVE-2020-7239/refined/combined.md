Download Link: [Chatbot with IBM Watson](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conversation-watson/#description)

#### Vulnerability - DOM XSS (CVE-2020-7239)

A DOM based XSS vulnerability has been identified in the chat functionality of the Watson Assistant plugin for WordPress, allowing a remote attacker to execute JavaScript in the victims browser by tricking the victim into pasting HTML inside the chat box.

#### Steps:

1. Locate a fresh WordPress installation.
2. Download the IBM Watson Assistant WordPress Plugin.
3. Install the plugin and follow the steps to set up, including but not limited to: a) create an IBM account, b) launch Watson assistant, c) view the API details, and d) integrate the API key and URL within the plugin.
4. Within Firefox, ensure the ChatBot is enabled and observe that the ChatBot appears on the home page.
5. Type the following into the chat interface:<svg//onload=alert(“XSS”)>
6. Observe that a pop-up appears, indicating that JavaScript executed within the browser.
7. Alternatively, open the browser’s developer tools’ network viewer while invoking XSS and observe that the XSS does not result from network traffic.

#### Browsers Verified In:

* Firefox v70.0.1
* Chrome v 78.0.3904.97

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Hooper Labs takes security issues seriously. We believe in working with relevant stakeholders to achieve coordinated disclosure within a reasonable period of time.
We also adhere to the industry-standard 90-day disclosure deadline, where vendors are notified of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared to the public after
90 days (or sooner if the issues are resolved earlier).

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are an industry standard for identifying vulnerabilities [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures). This system is a method for reference and tracking of publicly-known exposures. A CVE is a way to uniquely reference vulnerabilities across systems and Mitre
Corporation is the primary CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for the program. We believe that users have a right to know their exposures in order to make informed risk decisions.

Hooper Labs does not participate in bug bounty programs, but instead relies on responsible disclosure [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).
Effectively communicating vulnerabilities and risks to the vendor, users, and public ensure that risk can be documented, calculated, and mitigated. We hope that through this
process the Information Domain may be marginally safer.

## Description

Add this plugin to your site and let IBM watsonx Assistant help you better support your customers. In a few minutes, you can train watsonx Assistant to answer frequently asked questions, provide useful information and help them navigate your website. And if they want to talk to a human, the plugin can connect them to a real operator via telephone.

This plugin uses IBM watsonx Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation) on the IBM Cloud. You can use it with an IBM Cloud Lite account free of charge and without a need to provide a credit card.

Currently supported features:

* Take advantage of [Rich responses](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/dialog-overview.html#multimedia) to add images, pauses, and clickable responses to your chatbot
* Use user’s account data such as name in chatbot dialog
* Easy VOIP calling powered by Twilio for users to contact a real person if they wish
* Simple plugin setup to get your watsonx Assistant chatbot available to users as soon as possible
* Control usage of the watsonx Assistant service directly from the plugin settings page
* Choose the pages and posts you want the visitors to see the chat bot on
* Customize the appearance of the chat box to your preference

## Screenshots

  An example of your chatbot greeting a website visitor.

## Installation

#### Requirements

This plugin requires the [WordPress REST API Plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) to be installed. If you have WordPress 4.7 or later, this is installed by default.

#### Installing the Plugin

1. Log in to your site’s Dashboard.
2. Click on the `Plugins` tab in the left panel, then click the `Add New` button.
3. Search for “watsonx Assistant” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.
4. Install the plugin by clicking the `Install Now` link.
5. When installation finishes, click `Activate Plugin`.

This plugin can also be installed manually.

**Note:**

If your WordPress site is hosted by WordPress (with a URL like `websitename.wordpress.com`), you need a paid plan to install plugins. If your WordPress is hosted separately, you should have no issue.

#### Building Your Chatbot

1. Learn how to set up your watsonx Assistant chatbot with [this quick free course](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/chatbot-course).
2. [Sign up for a free IBM Cloud Lite account.](https://cocl.us/bluemix-registration)
3. You can see [the watsonx Assistant documentation](https://cocl.us/watson-conversation-help) for more information.

Once you’ve created your workspace using the course or the link above, you must connect it to your WordPress site.

#### Setting up the Plugin

1. From the Deploy tab of your workspace, you must obtain your username and password credentials in addition to the Workspace URL of your new workspace.
2. Enter these on the “Main Setup” tab of your settings page. Once you click “Save Changes”, the plugin will verify if the credentials are valid and notify you of whether or not the configuration was successful.
3. (Optional) By default, the chatbot shows up on all pages of your website. In the Behaviour tab of your settings page, you can choose which pages to show the chat bot on. You can also show the chat box inline within posts and pages using the shortcode `[watson-chat-box]`

**Note:**

If you have a server-side caching plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, you may need to clear your cache after changing settings or deactivating the plugin. Otherwise, your action may not take effect.

I always have a 404 error. It seems that the plugin does not work anymore.

Doesn’t work if you follow the plugin instructions. Always returns Please ensure you entered a valid Assistant URL (404). Click here for debug information.
Instead grab the embed code from the, errr, whatever screen it is within Web chat setup (the live one, not the draft one, there seems to be no way to copy live setup to draft???) and place it in your website <head> section. That works a treat.
Or if you’re desperate to use a plugin then grab the embed code above and within it you will see the correct Assistant URL, not the incorrect one that appears to be presented in the area you are told to get them from in the plugin instructions.
Then the Watson chat system works a treat.

works well but it would be much better if there is an option to add a typing animation that shows the bot is waiting for a response since it takes some time to connect with IBM

Simple to set up – more customization would be nice, such as adjustable size, stationary settings.

This works well and is intuitive. Easy integration with IBM Cloud. A feature suggestion might be allowing users to modify and edit more of the CSS properties of chatbot beyond basic font and icon sizing. Maybe a custom CSS box specifically for the chatbot design? Anyway, great feature.

## Description

Add this plugin to your site and let IBM watsonx Assistant help you better support your customers. In a few minutes, you can train watsonx Assistant to answer frequently asked questions, provide useful information and help them navigate your website. And if they want to talk to a human, the plugin can connect them to a real operator via telephone.

This plugin uses IBM watsonx Assistant (formerly Watson Conversation) on the IBM Cloud. You can use it with an IBM Cloud Lite account free of charge and without a need to provide a credit card.

Currently supported features:

* Take advantage of [Rich responses](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/conversation/dialog-overview.html#multimedia) to add images, pauses, and clickable responses to your chatbot
* Use user’s account data such as name in chatbot dialog
* Easy VOIP calling powered by Twilio for users to contact a real person if they wish
* Simple plugin setup to get your watsonx Assistant chatbot available to users as soon as possible
* Control usage of the watsonx Assistant service directly from the plugin settings page
* Choose the pages and posts you want the visitors to see the chat bot on
* Customize the appearance of the chat box to your preference

## Screenshots

  An example of your chatbot greeting a website visitor.

## Installation

#### Requirements

This plugin requires the [WordPress REST API Plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) to be installed. If you have WordPress 4.7 or later, this is installed by default.

#### Installing the Plugin

1. Log in to your site’s Dashboard.
2. Click on the `Plugins` tab in the left panel, then click the `Add New` button.
3. Search for “watsonx Assistant” and the latest version will appear at the top of the list of results.
4. Install the plugin by clicking the `Install Now` link.
5. When installation finishes, click `Activate Plugin`.

This plugin can also be installed manually.

**Note:**

If your WordPress site is hosted by WordPress (with a URL like `websitename.wordpress.com`), you need a paid plan to install plugins. If your WordPress is hosted separately, you should have no issue.

#### Building Your Chatbot

1. Learn how to set up your watsonx Assistant chatbot with [this quick free course](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/chatbot-course).
2. [Sign up for a free IBM Cloud Lite account.](https://cocl.us/bluemix-registration)
3. You can see [the watsonx Assistant documentation](https://cocl.us/watson-conversation-help) for more information.

Once you’ve created your workspace using the course or the link above, you must connect it to your WordPress site.

#### Setting up the Plugin

1. From the Deploy tab of your workspace, you must obtain your username and password credentials in addition to the Workspace URL of your new workspace.
2. Enter these on the “Main Setup” tab of your settings page. Once you click “Save Changes”, the plugin will verify if the credentials are valid and notify you of whether or not the configuration was successful.
3. (Optional) By default, the chatbot shows up on all pages of your website. In the Behaviour tab of your settings page, you can choose which pages to show the chat bot on. You can also show the chat box inline within posts and pages using the shortcode `[watson-chat-box]`

**Note:**

If you have a server-side caching plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, you may need to clear your cache after changing settings or deactivating the plugin. Otherwise, your action may not take effect.

I always have a 404 error. It seems that the plugin does not work anymore.

Doesn’t work if you follow the plugin instructions. Always returns Please ensure you entered a valid Assistant URL (404). Click here for debug information.
Instead grab the embed code from the, errr, whatever screen it is within Web chat setup (the live one, not the draft one, there seems to be no way to copy live setup to draft???) and place it in your website <head> section. That works a treat.
Or if you’re desperate to use a plugin then grab the embed code above and within it you will see the correct Assistant URL, not the incorrect one that appears to be presented in the area you are told to get them from in the plugin instructions.
Then the Watson chat system works a treat.

works well but it would be much better if there is an option to add a typing animation that shows the bot is waiting for a response since it takes some time to connect with IBM

Simple to set up – more customization would be nice, such as adjustable size, stationary settings.

This works well and is intuitive. Easy integration with IBM Cloud. A feature suggestion might be allowing users to modify and edit more of the CSS properties of chatbot beyond basic font and icon sizing. Maybe a custom CSS box specifically for the chatbot design? Anyway, great feature.
