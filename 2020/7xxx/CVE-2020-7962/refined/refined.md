Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weak password recovery mechanism in One Identity Password Manager 5.8. Specifically, the application's handling of secret answer verification during password reset allows for enumeration of valid answers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The application discloses whether a provided secret answer is correct or incorrect through the HTTP response content. This is because a "WRONG ID" parameter is only returned when the answer is incorrect.
- **Weak Password Recovery:** The ability to enumerate valid answers makes the password reset process vulnerable, as an attacker can then use the valid answer to reset a user's password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** By enumerating a valid secret answer, an attacker can successfully perform a password reset on the targeted user's account.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful password reset leads to unauthorized access to the user's account and associated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely.
- **HTTP Response Analysis:** The attacker analyzes HTTP response content to determine if a given secret answer is correct.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **User Enumeration (Optional):** While not explicitly stated, the attacker would likely need to know a valid username to target during password recovery.
- **Ability to Analyze HTTP Responses:** The attacker must be able to observe and analyze the HTTP responses from the password reset mechanism.
