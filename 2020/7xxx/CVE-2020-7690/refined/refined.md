Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `html` method in the `jsPDF` library does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied HTML input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the HTML content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a lack of input sanitization, specifically within the `html` method, allowing for XSS attacks. The vulnerability arises from directly embedding the unsanitized HTML input into the PDF generation process.
*   The `html` method processes the HTML content without properly escaping special characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user viewing the generated PDF (or within the context of the application using the `jsPDF` library), when the PDF is rendered/processed by a vulnerable application. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing sensitive information within the application's context.
    *   **Privileged Service Access:** Enabling access to privileged services and functionalities.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Delivering malware to the user.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates potential for loss of confidentiality, integrity (modification of data), and availability (reduced performance) due to the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Injection via `html` method:** The attacker injects malicious HTML code containing JavaScript into the `html` method of the `jsPDF` library.
*   **User Interaction:** Successful exploitation typically requires some user interaction, such as opening the maliciously crafted PDF or rendering the output using a vulnerable tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control HTML Input:** The attacker needs the ability to control the HTML input passed to the vulnerable `html` method of the `jsPDF` library.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability**: The attacker needs to know that the `jsPDF` library is vulnerable and how to exploit it.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker might need the user to take an action such as rendering the output.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application or to deliver the malicious content.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of `jspdf` prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A clear proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to inject the malicious JavaScript using an `img` tag with an `onerror` handler.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade `jspdf` to version 2.0.0 or higher, which includes fixes for this vulnerability.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
*   **Snyk's Analysis:** Snyk's analysis confirms the XSS vulnerability, provides a detailed explanation, and includes a CVSS score and EPSS score.
