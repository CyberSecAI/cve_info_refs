Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **command injection** flaw in the `ng-packagr` package. Specifically, it stems from the way the `styleIncludePaths` option is handled when processing LESS files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The `styleIncludePaths` option, which is user-controlled, was being directly incorporated into a shell command string without proper sanitization or escaping. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious shell commands.
*   The vulnerable code used `execSync` which executes a command in a subshell

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Total Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or system running `ng-packagr`. This could lead to the attacker gaining full control over the system. This includes the ability to read, modify, or delete any files, steal credentials, install malware, and disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing LESS files with the `styleIncludePaths` option.
*   The attacker would need to provide a malicious input to the `styleIncludePaths` configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges Required:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `styleIncludePaths` configuration used by `ng-packagr`.
*   **Network Attack Vector:** The attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability remotely if the build process is exposed through a network.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** The attacker needs to craft a specific input to exploit the command injection.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix replaces `execSync` with `execFileSync` and constructs command arguments in an array instead of a string to avoid command injection.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version `10.1.1` of `ng-packagr`.
