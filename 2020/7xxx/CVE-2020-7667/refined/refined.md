Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper path sanitization in the `github.com/sassoftware/go-rpmutils/cpio` package when extracting CPIO archives. Specifically, the `Extract` function doesn't correctly handle filenames containing ".." sequences, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where an attacker can manipulate file paths within a CPIO archive to write files outside the intended destination directory. This is a classic "Zip Slip" vulnerability that also applies to other archive formats such as CPIO.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code fails to adequately validate and sanitize the paths extracted from the CPIO archive. This allows filenames with relative path components (e.g., `../../file.txt`) to bypass security checks and potentially overwrite system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations within the filesystem accessible to the application. This includes potentially overwriting critical system files, configuration files, or executables.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting configuration files or executables with malicious content, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious CPIO Archive:** The attack vector is a specially crafted CPIO archive containing filenames with path traversal sequences (".."). The attacker needs to have the malicious CPIO archive processed by a vulnerable application using the affected `go-rpmutils/cpio` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CPIO archive that will be processed using the vulnerable `Extract` function.
- The attacker does not require any prior privileges or user interaction on the target system, but needs to be able to get the vulnerable system to process the malicious archive.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability using a `relative.cpio` file.
- The fix implemented in the provided commit sanitizes the extracted filenames by removing leading "../" sequences and verifying that the final path is still within the destination directory.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.1.0 of `github.com/sassoftware/go-rpmutils/cpio`.
- The CVSS score is 7.5 (High) with a network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction needed, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and no availability impact.
