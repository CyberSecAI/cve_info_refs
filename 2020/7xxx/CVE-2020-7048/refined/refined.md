Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7048:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WP Database Reset plugin lacked proper security controls in its database reset functions. Specifically, it did not implement capability checks or security nonces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated Database Reset:** The plugin allowed any unauthenticated user to reset any table in the database. This was due to the absence of security checks, meaning anyone could trigger a database reset via a simple request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Complete Data Loss:** Exploiting the vulnerability would result in a complete reset of the targeted database table, leading to a total loss of data availability.
- **Site Reset:**  An attacker could reset a WordPress site to its default state, effectively wiping all user-generated content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker could send a simple HTTP request to trigger the reset functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker did not need to be logged in or have any prior access to the WordPress site. They could be a completely anonymous user.
