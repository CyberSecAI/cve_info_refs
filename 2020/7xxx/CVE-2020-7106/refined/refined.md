Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7106:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2020-7106. The CVE description states: "Cacti 1.2.8 has stored XSS in data_sources.php, color_templates_item.php, graphs.php, graph_items.php, lib/api_automation.php, user_admin.php, and user_group_admin.php, as demonstrated by the description parameter in data_sources.php (a raw string from the database that is displayed by $header to trigger the XSS)."
Multiple sources explicitly mention CVE-2020-7106 and describe it as a stored XSS vulnerability in Cacti due to a lack of proper escaping.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper output escaping on certain Cacti pages, specifically when handling data stored in the database, such as the description field in `data_sources.php`. This allows for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is then executed when the page is viewed by another user.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before it is displayed on web pages. Specifically, the `description` parameter in `data_sources.php` and other locations were vulnerable to Stored XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information visible on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the web pages.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the Cacti web interface by entering malicious data in input fields such as the `description` field when creating or editing data sources. The vulnerability can be triggered by browsing to the vulnerable pages after the malicious data has been stored in the database.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires the ability to modify data that is stored in Cactiâ€™s database. This typically means having access to a Cacti account with sufficient privileges, however, some CSRF attacks may allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform this action on a victim's behalf.
    *   The attacker does not necessarily need to have administrator privileges but requires access to modify device or data source information that will trigger the XSS when viewed by another user.
    *   The attacker does not need to be on the same network. A remote user can perform the attack.

**3. Additional Technical Details and Descriptions**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Cacti version 1.2.9 and later.
*   The issue exists in multiple files including `data_sources.php`, `color_templates_item.php`, `graphs.php`, `graph_items.php`, `lib/api_automation.php`, `user_admin.php`, and `user_group_admin.php`
*   The XSS is triggered because a raw string from the database is displayed without escaping using `$header` on the vulnerable pages.
*   The vulnerability affects openSUSE, SUSE Package Hub, and Debian.
*   The Debian security advisory indicates that the `sanitize_uri` function in `lib/functions.php` and the lack of `ENT_QUOTES` flag when using `htmlspecialchars` are the root cause for some XSS issues, including CVE-2020-7106.
*   Some reports indicate that color items were not properly escaped and could also lead to XSS.
*   The Suse security advisory states that CVE-2020-7106 has a base score of 6.1 using CVSS v3 scoring, with an attack vector of Network, low complexity and no privileges required, but user interaction is required.
