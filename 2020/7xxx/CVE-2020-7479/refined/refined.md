Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the IGSSupdateservice service before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Access Control
- Privilege Escalation
- Insufficient input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the SYSTEM user. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the system is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The vulnerability is in the IGSSupdateservice service, which listens on TCP port 12414 by default.
- An attacker can leverage a user-supplied path to perform malicious file operations due to the lack of proper validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target machine. This implies a prior compromise or the presence of an existing vulnerability that allows for code execution.
- They must be on the local network as the service is running on localhost.

**Additional details:**
- Schneider Electric has released an update to patch this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-12-10.
