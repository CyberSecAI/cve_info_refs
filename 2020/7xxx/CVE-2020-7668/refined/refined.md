{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ExtractTo` function in the `github.com/unknwon/cae/tz` package does not properly sanitize file paths within zip archives, allowing path traversal through leading or non-leading \"..\" sequences.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Write",
      "Path Traversal (Zip Slip)",
       "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite or add files outside of the intended target directory. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if an executable or configuration file is replaced with malicious content.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted archive containing path traversal filenames (e.g., \"../../file.exe\").",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious archive that will be processed by the vulnerable function."
