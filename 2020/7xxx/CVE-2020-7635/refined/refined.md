Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7635

**Root Cause:** The `compass-compile` package is vulnerable to command injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `options` argument in the `compile` function. The `compassCommand` property within the options is directly used to construct and execute a command without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Command Injection (CWE-74):** User-controlled input (options.compassCommand) is incorporated into a command that's then executed by the system. This allows arbitrary commands to be run on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable application is running.
* **Confidentiality Loss:** Complete loss of confidentiality, as the attacker can gain access to all resources within the impacted component.
* **Integrity Loss:**  Modification of data is possible, although the attacker might not have full control over the consequences.
* **Availability Impact**: No direct impact on availability, but the attacker can potentially cause a denial of service by other means, as they have arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
* **User Controlled Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by passing malicious input as the `options` argument, specifically controlling the `compassCommand` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **No privileges required**: The attacker does not need prior access to the system.
* **No user interaction required:** Exploitation can occur without any user action.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in `lib/compass.js` in the `compass-compile` package.
* The `generateCommand` function constructs a command using the `compassCommand` option.
* The `exec` function from Node.js' `child_process` module is used to execute the constructed command.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `touch` command to create a file on the server using `options.compassCommand:"touch JHU"`.

**Additional Notes:**
* There is no fixed version available for the `compass-compile` package.
* Snyk's analysis provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium), whereas NVD gives a score of 9.8 (Critical), highlighting the severity difference among different analysis.
* Snyk identified the vulnerability to have a proof of concept available.
