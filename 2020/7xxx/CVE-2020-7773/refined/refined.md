```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the `lang` attribute within the inline code highlighting feature of `markdown-it-highlightjs`. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through the `lang` attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could result in session hijacking, stealing of cookies, access to sensitive information, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a markdown code block with a malicious lang attribute like `{."><img onerror=alert(1) src=.>js}`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious markdown code that includes inline code highlighting with a crafted `lang` attribute into an application using the vulnerable `markdown-it-highlightjs` library.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located within the parsing logic of the library where the `lang` attribute is not properly sanitized before being rendered as part of the HTML output. The fix involves using `md.utils.escapeHtml()` to properly escape the content of the `lang` attribute, preventing the interpretation of malicious HTML/JavaScript code."
