  "CVE-2020-7071": {
    "description": "In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.26, 7.4.x below 7.4.14 and 8.0.0, when validating URL with functions like filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL), PHP will accept an URL with invalid password as valid URL. This may lead to functions that rely on URL being valid to mis-parse the URL and produce wrong data as components of the URL.",
    "root_cause": "The `filter_var()` function with `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL` does not properly validate the userinfo part of a URL, specifically the password component, allowing URLs with invalid passwords to be considered valid.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
        "URL parsing inconsistency"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to URL misinterpretation. This may result in an application connecting to a wrong server, making incorrect access control decisions or other security implications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted URL that bypasses the validation process of `filter_var` function.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists because `parse_url()` function can return different parts of the URL than what `filter_var()` considers valid. When used together, an attacker could pass a URL that `filter_var` validates, but `parse_url()` interprets in a malicious way."

    "description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.33, 7.3.x below 7.3.21 and 7.4.x below 7.4.9, while processing PHAR files using phar extension, phar_parse_zipfile could be tricked into accessing freed memory, which could lead to a crash or information disclosure.",
        "root_cause": "The `phar_parse_zipfile` function in the PHAR extension of PHP has a use-after-free vulnerability.",

        "description": "In PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.34, 7.3.x below 7.3.23 and 7.4.x below 7.4.11, when AES-CCM mode is used with openssl_encrypt() function with 12 bytes IV, only first 7 bytes of the IV is actually used. This can lead to both decreased security and incorrect encryption data.",
        "root_cause": "The `openssl_encrypt()` function when used with AES-CCM mode and a 12-byte IV incorrectly uses only the first 7 bytes of the provided IV, leading to IV reuse.",

          "Insufficient Randomness",
          "Incorrect cryptographic implementation"
        ],
