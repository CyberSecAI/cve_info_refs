Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-7663:

**1. Root Cause:**
  - The vulnerability stems from a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) flaw in the `websocket-extensions` Ruby gem's parser for the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header.
  - The regular expression used to parse the header was vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking when processing specially crafted inputs.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **ReDoS:** The core issue is a poorly constructed regular expression that can take an exponentially long time to process certain inputs.
  - **Vulnerable Parsing Logic:** Specifically, the parser struggles when encountering a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header that contains an unclosed string parameter value with a repeating sequence of a backslash and another character (e.g., `a; b="\c\c\c\c..."`).
  - **Ambiguous Grammar:** The grammar for `quoted-string` allowed a single backslash to appear, causing ambiguity and leading to backtracking when the regex engine attempted to parse sequences of backslashes.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a malicious WebSocket handshake request with a crafted header, causing the server's thread to become blocked while it struggles to process the malicious input.
  - **Single-Threaded Server Impact:** This can render the server completely unresponsive if it is single-threaded since the malicious request will exhaust the server's capacity.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
  - **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network by sending a specially crafted HTTP WebSocket handshake request.
  - **`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` Header:** The attack is carried out by including a malicious string in the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
  - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or special access.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable pattern is within the `quoted-string` definition: `/"((?:\\[\x00-\x7f]|[^\x00-\x08\x0a-\x1f\x7f"])*)"/`.
- The issue is with the overlapping sets being matched within the quoted-string, specifically when parsing the backslash. The pattern `\c` can be matched either as two `qdtext` characters or as a single `quoted-pair` when the string isn't properly closed, leading to the excessive backtracking.
- The fix involves modifying the regular expression to avoid the overlap and ensure correct parsing of quoted strings according to RFC 7230, where backslashes cannot appear on their own.

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.1.5 of the `websocket-extensions` Ruby gem.
- The fix modifies the regular expression used for parsing the header to prevent excessive backtracking.

**Workarounds:**

- The only known workaround is to disable any public-facing WebSocket functionality.
