This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Don't replace regex / function placeholders within string literals ([#79](https://github.com/yahoo/serialize-javascript/pull/79))

Previously we weren't checking if the quote that started the placeholder
was escaped or not, meaning an object like

    {"foo": /1"/, "bar": "a\"@__R-<UID>-0__@"}

Would be serialized as

    {"foo": /1"/, "bar": "a\/1"/}

meaning an attacker could escape out of `bar` if they controlled both
`foo` and `bar` and were able to guess the value of `<UID>`.

UID was generated once on startup, was chosen using `Math.random()` and
had a keyspace of roughly 4 billion, so within the realm of an online
attack.

Here's a simple example that will cause `console.log()` to be called when
the `serialize()`d version is `eval()`d

    eval('('+ serialize({"foo": /1" + console.log(1)/i, "bar": '"@__R-<UID>-0__@'}) + ')');

Where `<UID>` is the guessed `UID`.

This fixes the issue by ensuring that placeholders are not preceded by
a backslash.

We also switch to a higher entropy `UID` to prevent people from guessing it.
