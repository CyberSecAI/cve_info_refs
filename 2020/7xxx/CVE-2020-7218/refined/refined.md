Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of resource limits or throttling in HashiCorp Nomad's handling of HTTP and RPC connections. Specifically, the server did not properly limit the number of connections it would accept, allowing an attacker to establish numerous connections and consume excessive server resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unbounded resource usage: The primary weakness is the absence of limits on the number of HTTP and RPC connections, which allows for excessive resource consumption.
- Lack of authentication requirements:  The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it easier for attackers to initiate the attack.
- Insufficient connection handling:  The server's handling of incoming connections did not include any mechanism for rate limiting or throttling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition where the Nomad server becomes overloaded and unresponsive, effectively disrupting its availability.
- Server crash: The excessive resource consumption may lead to server crashes.
- Availability Impact: Successful exploitation affects the availability of the Nomad deployment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-level connectivity: Any party with network-level access to a Nomad server can exploit the vulnerability.
- Unauthenticated HTTP/RPC connections: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by establishing many unauthenticated HTTP or RPC connections to a vulnerable Nomad server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the target Nomad server.
- No authentication required: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it easier for an attacker to perform a DoS attack.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Versions: All Nomad and Nomad Enterprise versions prior to 0.10.3 are vulnerable.
- Patched Versions: Fixed in version 0.10.3 and later.
- Mitigation: Besides upgrading, users can restrict access to Nomad servers to trusted networks, enforce network connection limits using tools like iptables, and enable mutual TLS.
- Introduced configuration options:  The fix introduces new configuration options like `rpc_max_conns_per_client`, `rpc_handshake_timeout`, `http_max_conns_per_client`, and `https_handshake_timeout` to restrict resource usage.
- CVSS Score: The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, categorized as high severity with a network attack vector, low complexity, and high impact on availability. The confidentiality and integrity are not affected
