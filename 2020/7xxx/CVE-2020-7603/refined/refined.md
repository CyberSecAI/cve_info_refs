Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7603

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `options` argument of the `exports` function in `index.js` of the `closure-compiler-stream` package is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the execution environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where user-controlled input is used to construct a system command, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code lacks proper sanitization of the `options` argument, which enables the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** There is potential for total loss of confidentiality, with attackers gaining access to restricted information, including administrator passwords or private encryption keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker provides a malicious `options` object containing an injection payload when calling the affected function. Specifically, this payload is placed within the `module` array.
- The vulnerability can be exploited without user interaction and via the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the `options` argument passed to the `closure-compiler-stream` package.
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.9 (Medium) according to Snyk, and a 9.8 (Critical) according to NVD.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is available demonstrating the vulnerability. The PoC injects a command to create a file on the system, showcasing arbitrary command execution.
- There is no fixed version available for this vulnerability.
