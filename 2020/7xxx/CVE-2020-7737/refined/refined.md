Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7737

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `safetydance` package is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via the `set` function, which allows an attacker to modify the `__proto__` property of an object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core vulnerability is the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, specifically the `Object` prototype. This is achieved through the `set` function, which does not sanitize or validate the input path, allowing modification of the `__proto__` property.
- Unsafe property definition by path: The `set` function allows defining property values on an object based on a given path, and by controlling the path value, an attacker can set the path to `__proto__.myValue` which results in the pollution of the prototype of the class of the object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service. For example, polluting `Object.prototype.toString` with an integer would cause code reliant on `someobject.toString()` to fail.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): In scenarios where the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object and executes it (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker can pollute the prototype and inject malicious code.
- Property Injection: Attackers can pollute properties that the codebase relies on for informational value, including security properties like cookies or tokens. For example, injecting `isAdmin` property on `Object.prototype` can lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is executed by manipulating the `set` function of the `safetydance` library.
- By setting a path within the `set` function's arguments to `__proto__`, the attacker can directly modify the `Object.prototype`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the arguments passed to the `set` function of the vulnerable `safetydance` library.
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3 (High) according to Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) according to NVD.
- Snyk's analysis mentions a proof-of-concept for exploitation.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by freezing the prototype using `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`, requiring schema validation of JSON input, avoiding unsafe recursive merge functions, using objects without prototypes, and using `Map` instead of `Object`.
