Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `marked-tree` package is vulnerable to directory traversal because the path provided to `fs.readFile` in `index.js` is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input (specifically, file paths) before using it to access files on the server's file system. This lack of sanitization allows attackers to navigate outside of the intended directory and access arbitrary files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the contents of sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing source code, configuration files, or other critical system files.
        *   The example given shows how an attacker could potentially access the private key of the root user.
    *   While not stated as a direct impact, the content refers to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities with zip-slip, which is a related weakness.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by crafting malicious HTTP requests with manipulated file paths.
    *   **HTTP Request:** An attacker can send a request to the server including `../` sequences in the path to access files outside the intended directory.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No prior authorization required:** Attackers do not need any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Snyk content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl` to access a file outside the intended directory.
*   The content also includes CVSS v3.1 scores, categorizing the severity as high (7.5) due to the attack vector being over the network, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope and high confidentiality impact.
*   There is no fixed version for the `marked-tree` package.
