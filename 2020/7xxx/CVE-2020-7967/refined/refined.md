The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2020-7967.

**CVE-2020-7967**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The issue was caused by a lack of proper authorization checks, which allowed non-members to view activity counts of issues and merge requests, despite project settings otherwise restricting this information.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authorization leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Non-members can view activity counts of issues and merge requests, which could expose sensitive information about project activity.
*  **Attack vectors:** Accessing the GitLab instance via a web browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a non-member of the project to exploit this.
