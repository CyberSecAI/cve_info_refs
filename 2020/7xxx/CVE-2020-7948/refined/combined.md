WordPress Plugin for [Auth0](https://auth0.com) Authentication

[![License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb440dcbcc31b1982def266f64a2eda60faf19c2f85ec9d2426c6948be20fc10/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7061636b61676973742f6c2f61757468302f61757468302d706870)](https://doge.mit-license.org/)

🚀 [Getting Started](#getting-started) - 💻 [SDK Usage](#sdk-usage) - 📆 [Support Policy](#support-policy) - 💬 [Feedback](#feedback)

## Overview

The Auth0 WordPress plugin replaces the standard WordPress login flow with a new authentication process using Auth0's Universal Login experience. This enables you to secure your WordPress site with Auth0's advanced features, such as MFA, SSO, Passwordless, PassKey, and so on.

Important

This plugin is **NOT** a SDK (Software Development Kit.) It's APIs are internal and not intended for developers to extend directly. We do not support altering the plugin's behavior or integrating it in any way beyond what is outlined in this README. If you're looking to build a more extensive integration, please create a solution using the [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php) instead.

Warning

v4 of the plugin is no longer supported as of June 2023. We are no longer providing new features or bugfixes for that release. Please upgrade to v5 as soon as possible.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* PHP 8.1+
* [Most recent version of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/)
* Database credentials with table creation permissions

> Please review our [support policy](#support-policy) on specific PHP and WordPress versions and when they may exit support in the future.

### Installation

#### Composer

The plugin supports installation through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and is [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) compatible. This approach is preferred when using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), but will work with virtually any WordPress installation.

For [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) installations, you'll usually run this command from the root WordPress installation directory, but check the documentation the project's maintainers provide for the best guidance.

For standard WordPress installations, this command can be run from the `wp-content/plugins` sub-directory.

```
composer require symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7 auth0/wordpress:^5.0

```
**Note on Composer Dependencies**

When installed with Composer, the plugin depends on the presence of [PSR-18](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation) and [PSR-17](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation) library implementations. The `require` command above includes two such libraries (`symfony/http-client` and `nyholm/psr7`) that satisfy these requirements, but you can use any other compatible libraries that you prefer. Visit Packagist for a list of [PSR-18](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation) and [PSR-17](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation) providers.

If you are using Bedrock or another Composer-based configuration, you can try installing `auth0/wordpress` without any other dependencies, as the implementations may be satisfied by other already installed packages.

> **Note** PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs) are standards for PHP libraries and applications that enable greater interoperability and choice. You can learn more about them and the PHP-FIG organization that maintains them [here](https://www.php-fig.org/).

### Activation

After installation, you must activate the plugin within your WordPress site:

1. Open your WordPress Dashboard.
2. Select 'Plugins' from the sidebar, and then 'Installed Plugins.'
3. Choose 'Activate' underneath the plugin's name.

### Configure Auth0

1. Sign into Auth0. If you don't have an account, [it's free to create one](https://auth0.com/signup).
2. [Open 'Applications' from your Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/create), and select 'Create Application.'
3. Choose 'Regular Web Application' and then 'Create.'
4. From the newly created application's page, select the Settings tab.

Please prepare the following information:

* Note the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**, available from the newly created Application's Settings page. You will need these to configure the plugin in the next step.
* From your WordPress Dashboard's General Settings page, note your **WordPress Address** and **Site Address** URLs. We recommend you read our guidance on [common WordPress URL issues](#common-wordpress-url-issues).

Continue configuring your Auth0 application from its Settings page:

* **Allowed Callback URLs** should include the URL to your WordPress site's `wp-login.php`.
  + In most (but not all) cases, this will be your WordPress Address with `/wp-login.php` appended.
  + Please ensure your site is configured never to cache this URL, or you may see an "invalid state" error during login.
* **Allowed Web Origins** should include both your WordPress Address and Site Address URLs.
* **Allowed Logout URLs** should consist of your WordPress Address.

**Common WordPress URL Issues**

* These must be the URLs your visitors will use to access your WordPress site. If you are using a reverse proxy, you may need to manually configure your WordPress Address and Site Address URLs to match the URL you use to access your site.
* Make sure these URLs match your site's configured protocol. When using a reverse proxy, you may need to update these to reflect serving over SSL/HTTPS.
**Troubleshooting**

If you're encountering issues, start by checking that your Auth0 Application is setup like so:

* **Application Type** must be set to **Regular Web Application**.
* **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** must be set to **Post**.
* **Allowed Origins (CORS)** should be blank.

Scroll down and expand the "Advanced Settings" panel, then:

* Under **OAuth**:
  + Ensure that **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to **RS256**.
  + Check that **OIDC Conformant** is enabled.
* Under **Grant Types**:
  + Ensure that **Implicit**, **Authorization Code**, and **Client Credentials** are enabled.
  + You may also want to enable **Refresh Token**.
### Configure the Plugin

Upon activating the Auth0 plugin, you will find a new "Auth0" section in the sidebar of your WordPress Dashboard. This section enables you to configure the plugin in a variety of ways.

For the plugin to operate, at a minimum, you will need to configure the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret fields. These are available from the Auth0 Application you created in the previous step. Once configured, select the "Enable Authentication" option to have the plugin begin handling authentication for you.

We recommend testing on a staging/development site using a separate Auth0 Application before putting the plugin live on your production site.

### Configure WordPress

#### Plugin Database Tables

The plugin uses dedicated database tables to guarantee high performance. When the plugin is activated, it will use the database credentials you have configured for WordPress to create these tables.

Please ensure your configured credentials have appropriate privileges to create new tables.

#### Cron Configuration

The plugin uses WordPress' [background task manager](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/) to perform important periodic tasks. Proper synchronization between WordPress and Auth0 relies on this.

By default, WordPress' task manager runs on every page load, which is inadvisable for production sites. For best performance and reliability, please ensure you have configured WordPress to use a [cron job](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/) to run these tasks periodically instead.

## SDK Usage

The plugin is built on top of [Auth0-PHP](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) — Auth0's full-featured PHP SDK for Authentication and Management APIs.

For custom WordPress development, please do not extend the plugin's classes themselves, as this is not supported. Nearly all of the plugin's APIs are considered `internal` and will change over time, most likely breaking any custom extension built upon them.

Instead, please take advantage of the full PHP SDK that the plugin is built upon. You can use the plugin's `getSdk()` method to retrieve a configured instance of the SDK, ready for use. This method can be called from the plugin's global `wpAuth0()` helper, which returns the WordPress plugin itself.

```
<?php

$plugin = wpAuth0(); // Returns an instanceof Auth0\WordPress\Plugin
   $sdk = wpAuth0()->getSdk(); // Returns an instanceof Auth0\SDK\Auth0
```

Please direct questions about developing with the Auth0-PHP SDK to the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com), and issues or feature requests to [it's respective repository](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP). Documentations and examples on working with the Auth0-PHP SDKs are also available from [its repository](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP).

## Support Policy

* Our PHP version support window mirrors the [PHP release support schedule](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). Our support for PHP versions ends when they stop receiving security fixes.
* As Automattic's stated policy is "security patches are backported when possible, but this is not guaranteed," we only support [the latest release](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/) marked as ["actively supported"](https://endoflife.date/wordpress) by Automattic.

| Plugin Version | WordPress Version | PHP Version | Support Ends |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 6 | 8.3 | Nov 2026 |
|  |  | 8.2 | Dec 2025 |
|  |  | 8.1 | Nov 2024 |

Composer and WordPress do not offer upgrades to incompatible versions. Therefore, we regularly deprecate support within the plugin for PHP or WordPress versions that have reached end-of-life. These deprecations are not considered breaking changes and will not result in a major version bump.

Sites running unsupported versions of PHP or WordPress will continue to function but will not receive updates until their environment is upgraded. For your security, please ensure your PHP runtime and WordPress remain up to date.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## Description

This plugin replaces standard WordPress login forms with one powered by [Auth0](https://auth0.com) that enables:

* **Universal authentication**
  + Over 30 social login providers
  + Enterprise connections (ADFS, Active Directory / LDAP, SAML, Office 365, Google Apps and more)
  + Connect your own database
  + Passwordless connections (using email or SMS)
* **Ultra secure**
  + Multifactor authentication
  + Password policies
  + Email validation
  + Mitigate brute force attacks

### Technical Notes

**IMPORTANT**: By using this plugin you are delegating the site authentication and profile handling to Auth0. That means that you won’t be using the WordPress database to authenticate users and the default WordPress login forms will be replaced.

Please see our [How It Works page](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/how-does-it-work) for more information on how Auth0 authenticates and manages your users.

#### Migrating Existing Users

Auth0 allows multiple authentication providers. You can have social providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and more, a database of users and passwords (just like WordPress but hosted in Auth0), or you can use an Enterprise directory like Active Directory, LDAP, Office365, Google Apps, or SAML. All those authentication providers might give you an email and a flag indicating whether the email was verified or not. We use that email (only if it is verified) to associate a previous **existing** user with the one coming from Auth0.

If the email was not verified and there is an account with that email in WordPress, the user will be presented with a page saying that the email was not verified and a link to “Re-send the verification email.” For either scenario, you can choose whether it is mandatory that the user has a verified email or not in the plugin settings.

**Please note:** In order for a user to log in using Auth0, they will need to sign up via the Auth0 login form (or have an account created for them in Auth0). Once signup is complete, their Auth0 user will be automatically associated with their WordPress user.

#### Widget

You can enable Auth0 as a WordPress widget in order to show it in a sidebar. The widget inherits the main plugin settings but can be overridden with its own settings in the widget form. Note: this form will not display for logged-in users.

#### Shortcode

Also, you can use the Auth0 widget as a shortcode in your editor. Just add the following to use the global settings:

```
[auth0]

```

Like widgets, shortcode login forms will use the settings of the plugin. It can be customized by adding the following attributes:

* `icon_url` – A direct URL to an image used at the top of the login form
* `form_title` – Text to appear at the top of the login form
* `gravatar` – Display the user’s Gravatar; set to `1` for yes
* `redirect_to` – A direct URL to use after successful login
* `dict` – Valid JSON to override form text ([see options here](https://github.com/auth0/lock/blob/master/src/i18n/en.js))
* `extra_conf` – Valid JSON to override Lock configuration ([see options here](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v11/configuration))
* `show_as_modal` – Display a button that triggers the login form in a modal; set to `1` for yes
* `modal_trigger_name` – Button text to display when using a modal

Example:

```
[auth0 show_as_modal="1" modal_trigger_name="Login button: This text is configurable!"]

```

Note: this form will not display for logged-in users.

## Installation

This plugin requires a [free or paid](https://auth0.com/pricing) Auth0 account.

1. [Sign up here](https://auth0.com/signup).
2. Follow the [installation instructions here](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/installation).

## FAQ

### Can I customize the Auth0 login form?

The Auth0 login form is called Lock and it’s [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0/lock). You can style the form like any of your site components by enqueuing a stylesheet in your theme. Use the [`login_enqueue_scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/login_enqueue_scripts/) hook to style the form on wp-login.php, [`wp_enqueue_scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_enqueue_scripts/) to style widgets and shortcodes, or both to affect the form in all locations.

### Can I access the user profile information?

The Auth0 plugin transparently handles login information for your WordPress site and the plugins you use, so that it looks like any other login. User profile data changes in WordPress **are not** currently sent to Auth0 but changes to the Auth0 user account **are** stored in WordPress user meta (under the key `auth0_obj` prefixed with `$wpdb->prefix`).

### When I install this plugin, will existing users still be able to log in?

Yes, either by allowing the WordPress login form to be displayed or through migrating existing users. See the **Technical Notes** section above.

### What authentication providers do you support?

Please see our [complete list of supported social and enterprise authentication providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).

### How can I use Lock configuration options that are not provided on the settings page?

Use the “Extra Settings” field on the plugin settings’ **Advanced** tab to add a JSON object with all additional configurations. For more information on what else can be configured, see the [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v11/configuration).

### Is this plugin compatible with WooCommerce?

Yes, this plugin will override the default WooCommerce login forms with the Auth0 login form.

### My question is not covered here … what do I do?

All is not lost!

* If you’re setting up the plugin for the first time or having issues with users logging in, please review our [troubleshooting](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/troubleshoot) and [configuration](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/configuration) documentation.
* If you found a bug in the plugin code, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/pulls) on GitHub.
* If you have questions about how to use Auth0 or the plugin, please [post on our community site](https://community.auth0.com/) or create a [support forum request here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auth0).
* You can see additional documentation and answers on our [support site](https://support.auth0.com/). Customers on a paid Auth0 plan can [submit a trouble ticket](https://support.auth0.com/tickets) for a fast response.

The title says it all. I spent the better part of 3 days trying to get this to work with no luck. I even paid for a plan to get support. They were little to no help. I use miniorange for my SSO needs. It works decently and has good support.

Unfortunately, plugin doesn’t work and abandoned. On official Github repository you can find this text:
v4 of the plugin is no longer supported as of June 2023. We are no longer providing new features or bugfixes for that release. Please upgrade to v5 as soon as possible.
OAuth0 Github
But irony that v5 doesn’t work as well, so both versions of plugin are just a waste of time

I have some questions about signing JWT’s, but other than that, the documentation is exhaustive, which is one of the reasons why I chose it. You can tell when a project is put together well.

I use multiple WordPress sites and other member platform. When I set every site login via Auth0, it creates seamless experience for users.
I decide to user only Passwordless email. This will help people secure their accounts (because of no password to remember and no easy password remains.)

Multiple users are not allowed to login getting the error : “This site requires a verified email”, even though this is not enabled in the settings.
I’ve tried reporting this, getting absolutely zero response after 6 months…
