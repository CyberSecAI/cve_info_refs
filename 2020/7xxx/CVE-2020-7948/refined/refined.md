*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to interact with the plugin using a manipulated or crafted object identifier. This could involve modifying parameters in HTTP requests made to the plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to interact with the WordPress application where the vulnerable Auth0 plugin is installed. They would need knowledge of how the plugin handles object references to craft malicious requests. It is not specified if the attacker needs to be logged in or not.
