Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-7216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ni_dhcp4_parse_response` function within the wicked DHCPv4 client.
- When this function processes a DHCPv4 packet that is missing the message type option, it fails to free the allocated lease and does not clear the corresponding lease pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, the lease memory is allocated, but not freed when the message type option is absent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly send crafted DHCPv4 packets lacking the message type option, causing the vulnerable system to allocate memory without releasing it. This leads to memory exhaustion and eventually a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network.
- Attackers send specially crafted DHCPv4 packets that lack the message type option to a system running vulnerable versions of wicked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be capable of crafting malicious DHCPv4 packets.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `wicked` version 0.6.55 and earlier.
- The issue is resolved in later versions of `wicked`.
- SUSE has released multiple security advisories and patches for different SUSE products to address this vulnerability.
- The severity is considered moderate.

The provided information aligns with the description of CVE-2020-7216, which is "An ni_dhcp4_parse_response memory leak in openSUSE wicked 0.6.55 and earlier allows network attackers to cause a denial of service by sending DHCP4 packets without a message type option."
