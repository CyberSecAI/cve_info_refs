Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `safe-eval` package's improper handling of error objects, specifically how it fails to sanitize the `stack` property of an error object, which is then evaluated by `safe-eval`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through a crafted error object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** The primary vulnerability is a sandbox escape, where an attacker can break out of the intended restricted environment provided by `safe-eval`.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `safe-eval` library does not properly sanitize or validate the `stack` property of error objects before evaluating them, which is a critical oversight.
*   **Abuse of Error Object:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted error object, showcasing a weakness in how the library handles unexpected inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host machine by injecting malicious code, as demonstrated by the proof of concept (POC) using `child_process.execSync('whoami')`.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** There is a total loss of confidentiality, allowing the attacker to access all resources within the impacted component.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can modify any or all files protected by the impacted component.
*   **Loss of Availability:** The attacker can fully deny access to resources in the impacted component.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Code Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a crafted error object with a malicious `stack` property into the `safe-eval` function.
*   **Network:**  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, making it remotely exploitable, potentially over the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be performed without any interaction from a user.
*   **Requires injection of crafted error object:**  The attacker needs to be able to pass the crafted error object to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**

*   The proof of concept (POC) provided clearly shows how a crafted error object with a malicious `stack.match` function can be used to execute arbitrary system commands. This exploit leverages the `constructor` property of the `outer` variable within the `match` function and uses it to call `require` to load the `child_process` module.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the `safe-eval` package.
*   There is no fixed version for `safe-eval`.
*  Snyk assigned a severity of High with a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.1. NVD assigned a critical severity with a score of 9.8.
* The vulnerability was disclosed on Feb 28, 2020, and published on Aug 21, 2020.
