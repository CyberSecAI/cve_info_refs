Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7650:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `snyk-broker` package had a flaw that allowed arbitrary file reads due to insufficient access control.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Arbitrary File Read:** The vulnerability allows reading of arbitrary files on the system where `snyk-broker` is running. The files must end with `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json` extensions.
-   **Path traversal** is implied.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information stored in files ending with specific extensions (`yaml`, `yml`, `json`).

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Network access:** Attackers require network access to the Snyk's internal network
-   **High privileges:** Attackers need to have significant control over the vulnerable component which means a high degree of privilege over the service.
-   **No user interaction** is required.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects `snyk-broker` versions >=4.72.0 and <4.73.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Wing Chan of The Hut Group.
- Snyk has released version 4.73.1 to fix the issue.
