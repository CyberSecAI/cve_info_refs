{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of path sanitization in the `fs.readFile` function within the `index.js` file of the `fast-http` library. The library does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided paths, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal (CWE-22)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain access to files and directories outside of the intended folder. This can lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive files) and potentially writing arbitrary files, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating file paths with 'dot-dot-slash (../)' sequences or variations.",
        "Using absolute file paths."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable server, specifying a manipulated path in the URL.",
        "attacker_position": "The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable server"
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "poc": "A proof of concept is provided involving starting the server, creating a sensitive file in the parent directory, and then using curl with a crafted path to access the sensitive file.",
     "fix": "A fix has been pushed to the `master` branch but has not yet been published as of the time of this report"
  }
