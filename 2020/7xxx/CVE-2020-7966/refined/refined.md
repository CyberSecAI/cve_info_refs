Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The dependency proxy in GitLab had a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability in the dependency proxy
- Arbitrary file read vulnerability (this is mentioned as a separate vulnerability that *combined* with the path traversal could lead to file access)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Potential access to files and user data if the path traversal vulnerability is combined with the arbitrary file read vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is related to the dependency proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the dependency proxy in a way that allows exploiting the path traversal issue and the arbitrary file read.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description as it explains the root cause (path traversal in dependency proxy) and potential impact (access to files and user data if combined with another vulnerability)
*   The vulnerability affects GitLab EE versions 11.11 and later
*   The vulnerability was reported by @nyangawa of Chaitin Tech.
