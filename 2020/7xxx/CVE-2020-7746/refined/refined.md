Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7746:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `chart.js` library processes the `options` parameter. During the merging of provided options with existing or default options, the keys of the object being set are not checked, leading to prototype pollution.
*   Specifically, the issue arises from an unsafe recursive merge operation. When a source object contains a `__proto__` property, the merge function recurses with the target being the prototype of `Object`, allowing an attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, where an attacker can inject properties into the prototypes of JavaScript objects.
*   **Unsafe Object Recursive Merge:** The recursive merge function does not properly sanitize input, specifically not checking keys, allowing the injection of `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying properties like `toString` or `valueOf` on the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the codebase evaluates a specific attribute of an object and executes it (e.g., using `eval`), an attacker can inject malicious code through prototype pollution, potentially leading to RCE.
*  **Property Injection:** The attacker can pollute properties that the codebase relies on for their informative value, including security properties such as cookies or tokens.
**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `options` parameter when using the `chart.js` library. By crafting malicious options, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable merge operation.
*   The attack can be performed remotely as the vulnerable component is bound to the network stack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the application using the vulnerable library.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects `chart.js` versions prior to 2.9.4.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple packages: `chart.js`, `org.webjars.bower:chart.js`, `org.webjars.bowergithub.chartjs:chart.js`, and `org.webjars.npm:chart.js`
*   The fix involves upgrading to version 2.9.4 or higher, which addresses the unsafe merge operation by using `Object.create(null)` as the merge target.
*   The vulnerability has a high CVSS score (7.5 by Snyk, 9.8 by NVD)
