    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-7908",
    "description": "Reverse Tabnabbing is possible on several pages in TeamCity.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data used in URLs. Specifically, when a user opens a link in a new tab/window, the page from where the link originated can be manipulated via the 'window.opener' Javascript property of the new tab/window.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Reverse Tabnabbing"
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker could potentially redirect the victim to a malicious page, which could lead to phishing attacks or other malicious activities. This is possible because a user could be tricked into thinking they are still on a legitimate site, when actually they have been redirected to a fake page.",
    "attack_vector": "A user clicks on a crafted link within a TeamCity page that opens in a new tab or window.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious link into a TeamCity page accessible to the victim."
