- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header is not initialized when a TCP server transmits or retransmits a TCP SYN-ACK segment or a challenge ACK segment in response to a received RST during the TCP connection setup phase.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The uninitialized Traffic Class field results in the transmission of one byte of kernel memory over the network for each TCP SYN-ACK or challenge TCP-ACK segment sent over IPv6.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A byte of kernel memory is leaked over the network for each SYN-ACK or challenge TCP-ACK sent by a vulnerable server over IPv6. This information disclosure could potentially reveal sensitive information about the system's memory layout.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could initiate TCP connection attempts with a vulnerable server over IPv6, causing the server to send SYN-ACK packets or challenge ACK packets with the uninitialized Traffic Class field, thereby leaking kernel memory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable server over IPv6 to trigger the transmission of SYN-ACK segments or RST segments to receive a challenge ACK.
