Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `hellojs` library takes the `oauth_redirect` parameter from the URL and passes it directly to `location.assign()` without sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the `oauth_redirect` parameter, which is then executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Cookie Stealing:**  XSS is often used to steal cookies, which can lead to session hijacking.
*  **Data exposure:** XSS exploits can be used to expose sensitive information
*   **Malware Delivery**: XSS can be used to deliver malware
*  **Access to privileged services and functionality**

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload in the `oauth_redirect` parameter.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  The malicious payload is reflected back to the user's browser through the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs containing the malicious payload.
*   **Social Engineering (Likely):**  The attacker would likely need to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `hellojs` version 1.18.6.
*   The fix involved adding a check to validate that the `oauth_redirect` URL is a valid URL before redirecting.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which is a category system for software weaknesses.
* The CVSS score is 9.9 which is critical.
*  The EPSS score is 0.29% (69th percentile) which shows the probability of exploitation in the wild.
