{
  "CVE-2020-7699": {
    "Root cause": "Prototype Pollution vulnerability due to unsafe handling of the `parseNested` option in the express-fileupload middleware, which uses a recursive merge function that can be manipulated to pollute the prototype of JavaScript objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution",
      "Unsafe Object recursive merge",
      "Property definition by path"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation can lead to denial of service (DoS) by triggering JavaScript exceptions, remote code execution, or property injection, potentially leading to tampering with application source code, elevation of privileges, or disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a corrupt HTTP request with a manipulated `__proto__` property, which is processed by the vulnerable recursive merge function when the `parseNested` option is enabled.",
       "Manipulating properties to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable application and its configuration",
      "Ability to control certain parameters of the HTTP requests"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs in express-fileupload versions prior to 1.1.10 and specifically when the `parseNested` option is enabled.  The vulnerability exists in javascript libraries that use unsafe recursive merge operations or property definition by path.  This can be prevented by freezing the prototype, requiring schema validation, avoiding unsafe recursive merge operations, using objects without prototypes, or using Map instead of Object."
