Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerability exists in the Media Server component of Avaya Equinox Conferencing (now Avaya Meetings Server).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is XXE injection. This type of flaw allows an attacker to manipulate XML input to access local files, internal network resources, or cause a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can gain read access to information stored on the affected system.
-  It could potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the system.
- It is also network-based (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L), requiring valid login credentials for the system.
-  No user interaction (UI:N) is required for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Avaya Equinox Conferencing versions 9.0 through 9.1 FP10.
- The fix is available by upgrading to Avaya Meetings Server R9.1 FP11 or later, which fixes the vulnerability in the Media Server component.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.1, rated as high severity.
- The CVSS v3 vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H`, which breaks down as:
    -  AV:N (Network)
    - AC:L (Low Attack Complexity)
    - PR:L (Low Privileges Required)
    - UI:N (No User Interaction Required)
    - S:U (Unchanged Scope)
    - C:H (High Confidentiality Impact)
    - I:N (No Integrity Impact)
    - A:H (High Availability Impact)
