Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `blobmsg_format_json` function within the `libubox` library of OpenWrt. This function is responsible for converting tagged binary data (blobs) into JSON format.
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `blobmsg_format_json` function does not properly handle large numeric values of type double when serializing them into JSON.
- Specifically, when a large double value is encountered, the function overflows a fixed-size buffer allocated on the stack, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by crashing applications using the vulnerable `blobmsg_format_json` function.
- It's mentioned that `rpcd` can be crashed with a crafted input.
- The vulnerability could potentially be exploited for other purposes, though the provided text doesn't detail those.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers need to provide specially crafted binary blobs or JSON input to the `blobmsg_format_json` function.
- The malicious input has to contain a blob attribute with a large enough numeric value of type double to trigger the overflow during the serialization process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the capability to send crafted data to an application that uses `libubox` and the vulnerable function.
- The text provides an example of how this can be done using `ubus call`, which means that the attacker may need some level of access to the system, perhaps through the network or local access.

**Additional Details:**
- The `libubox` library is a core component in OpenWrt and is used by several other parts of the project, including `netifd`, `procd`, `ubus`, `rpcd`, and `uhttpd`. This increases the potential impact of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability also affects the `auc` (Attended sysUpgrade CLI) package.
- The provided content includes a command to crash `rpcd` which confirms that the vulnerability can be exploited to trigger a crash.
