Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how McAfee VirusScan Enterprise processes log files. Specifically, it stems from the ability to create a junction that the software will follow and leverage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Junction Abuse:** Attackers can create a junction to redirect file operations to an arbitrary location.
*   **File Overwrite:** The product can be tricked into overwriting the content of a chosen file by abusing the junction mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability and requires the attacker to have local access to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must already have the ability to execute code on the target system, though with limited privileges.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create junctions and manipulate the file system.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise.
*   The vulnerability was reported to McAfee on 2019-12-27, and a patch was released.
* The CVSS score is 7.8, with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
