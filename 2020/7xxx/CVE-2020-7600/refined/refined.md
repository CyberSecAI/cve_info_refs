Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7600

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `querymen` npm package. The `handler(type, name, fn)` function in the package allows user-controlled parameters without sanitization. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects, potentially injecting or modifying properties on all objects inheriting from `Object.prototype`.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `handler` function doesn't sanitize the input parameters `type` and `name`, allowing attackers to set them to `__proto__` or `constructor`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary focus, prototype pollution could lead to DoS by manipulating object properties in a way that causes the application to malfunction or crash.
- **Arbitrary Property Modification:** By polluting the prototype, an attacker can inject or overwrite properties on all objects inheriting from `Object.prototype`. This can have widespread impacts on application behavior and may lead to remote code execution in some cases depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `handler` function with attacker-controlled parameters.
- An attacker would need to send a crafted request to the application that uses the `querymen` library, where they can manipulate the `type` and `name` parameters passed to the `handler` function, setting them to `__proto__`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the application utilizing the vulnerable `querymen` library.
- No prior privileges or user interaction is needed for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in `querymen` version 2.1.4.
- Snyk provides a proof-of-concept and a detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-1321.
- The CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium).

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```javascript
var a = require("querymen");
a.handler("__proto__","toString","JHU");
console.log({}.toString);
```

This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can use the `handler` function to modify the `toString` method of `Object.prototype`, affecting all objects.
