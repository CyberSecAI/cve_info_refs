  "CVE-2020-7373": {
    "Description": "vBulletin 5.5.4 through 5.6.2 allows remote command execution via crafted subWidgets data in an ajax/render/widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel request. This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-16759. CVE-2020-7373 is a duplicate of CVE-2020-17496. CVE-2020-17496 is the preferred CVE ID to track this vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an insufficient patch for CVE-2019-16759. The patch added checks to prevent direct calls to the 'widget_php' template and introduced a function `cleanRegistered` to remove 'widgetConfig' values. However, a vulnerability was reintroduced through the `widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel` template, which loads user-controlled child templates and assigns their config to the 'widgetConfig' variable, bypassing the implemented checks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incomplete patch for CVE-2019-16759",
      "Logic bug in template rendering",
       "Improper input sanitization",
        "Unrestricted use of eval function with user-controlled data"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on the target system, leading to the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code and operating system commands within the context of the web application user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/ajax/render/widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel` endpoint, by manipulating the `subWidgets` parameter to load a 'widget_php' template with a malicious payload in the 'config[code]' field.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No authentication is required, and no specific attacker capabilities are needed besides the ability to craft and send the exploit request."
