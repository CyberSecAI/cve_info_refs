Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the `gulp-scss-lint` package. Specifically, the `exec` function in `src/command.js` is susceptible to arbitrary command injection through user-provided options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` function, allowing attackers to execute malicious code on the server or system where the package is used. This is a classic example of CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, enabling attackers to perform a wide range of malicious activities on the system, such as data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
- **Integrity Impact:** While the Snyk analysis states that there is no integrity impact, this is likely a mistake, as command injection can lead to changes in system behavior and data.
- **Availability Impact:** While the Snyk analysis states that there is no availability impact, this is also likely a mistake. Command injection could be used to render services unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `src` option provided to the `gulp-scss-lint` function. This option is passed directly to the command execution function, without proper sanitization or input validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the options passed to the `gulp-scss-lint` function. This could be done through manipulating the build process or injecting the malicious payload via a malicious dependency.
- The attacker doesn't require any privileges on the system prior to the attack.

**Additional details from the content:**
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating the injection using a crafted `src` option.
- The vulnerability has a Snyk severity rating of 5.9 (Medium) and an NVD severity rating of 9.8 (Critical). The difference in the scores can be attributed to how the CVSS is evaluated by the different organizations.
- A fix was pushed to the master branch, but has not been released to the public yet.
