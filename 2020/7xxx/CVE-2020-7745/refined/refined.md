Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7745:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a backdoor found in the `MintegralAdSDK` (specifically in versions prior to 6.6.0.0), which allows the ad SDK provider (Mintegral) to remotely execute arbitrary code on a user's device. This is achieved through the `MTGInvocationBoxing` class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The SDK contains a backdoor that enables the execution of arbitrary native code, which is a severe security vulnerability.
*   **Backdoor:** The presence of hidden functionality specifically designed to bypass security measures and allow unauthorized access and control.
*   **Data Collection:** The SDK had excessive data collection capabilities, including tracking HTTP requests, OpenURL events, and StoreKit methods. This data collection was often enabled without the developer's or user's consent.
*   **Obfuscation:** The SDK uses custom obfuscation techniques to conceal its malicious functionality, making it harder for security researchers and developers to analyze.
*   **Anti-Debugging/Anti-Proxy:**  The SDK includes checks to detect debuggers and network proxies, and it disables logging when these are detected, making it harder to analyze its behavior.
*   **Hidden download tracking:**  The Android version of the SDK is capable of tracking all app installations and other downloads (e.g., Google Docs) made on the device, and sends this information to Mintegral.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers (Mintegral or its partners/advertisers) could execute any code on the user's device, enabling a wide range of malicious activities.
*  **Data Theft:** Sensitive information, such as clipboard data (including passwords), could be stolen from the device by running malicious code via the ad SDK.
*  **Privacy Violation:** User's activity and data (including app installs and downloads, HTTP requests) are collected without consent and sent back to Mintegral.
*   **App Store Policy Violation:** Apps using the vulnerable SDK violate Apple's App Store guidelines due to remote code execution capabilities.
*   **Ad Fraud/Click Hijacking:** The SDK was used to commit ad attribution fraud and click hijacking activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.  The malicious code can be delivered to the device remotely over the network, through the ad banner.
*   **Remote Server Control:** Mintegral (or its partners) can control the code executed on the device by sending commands through the ad SDK.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ad SDK Provider Control:** The attacker needs control over the Mintegral ad server or the ability to serve malicious ad content via the SDK.
*   **No User Interaction (for RCE):** While the user needs to use an application with the SDK embedded, the actual exploitation of the RCE vulnerability does not require any additional user interaction.
*   **Network access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a remote location over the internet.
*   **Ability to modify ad content:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the ad content served by Mintegral to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Snyk research team.
*   Apple issued a notification to developers using the vulnerable SDK, requiring them to update their apps to remove the malicious component within a week.
*   The SDK's data collection methods were re-enabled by Mintegral after initially being disabled.
*   The Android version of the SDK also has hidden data collection and tracking functionality, including app installations and other downloads (e.g., Google Docs).
*   Several major mobile advertising platforms removed Mintegral as a network partner due to these findings.
