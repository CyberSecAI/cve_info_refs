### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

The Snyk research team is committed to helping secure developer ecosystems by researching and disclosing potential security exposures that would impact application developers. As part of this ongoing effort, Snyk has leveraged new information to conduct additional research into the Mintegral SDK. As a result of this research, additional findings have been uncovered.

The newest findings include the capability for Mintegral to execute code remotely via the SDK. Additionally, we’ve worked with developers to assist in their responses to our disclosures and there have been notable reactions from both Mintegral and the mobile advertising community that are worth highlighting as well. This is an update on the events that have occurred since our [initial disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/) of the potential security and privacy issues we identified in the Mintegral advertising SDK.

**At a glance:**

* Snyk identified a potential backdoor functionality for Remote Code Execution via Ads presented by the SDK.
* We identified a hidden “download tracking” functionality in the Android version of the SDK reporting back to Mintegral any downloads made from Google domain, including Applications (APK), Google Documents and other resources.
* Mintegral has taken numerous actions to respond to the concerns highlighted in our initial disclosures.
* Response from the mobile advertising community has been swift including multiple players removing Mintegral from their platforms.

## **Summary**

On August 24, 2020, Snyk announced the discovery of suspicious behaviors in the iOS version of a popular advertising SDK known as Mintegral. At that time, we had confirmed with partners in the advertising attribution space that at minimum, Mintegral appeared to be using this functionality to gather large amounts of data and commit ad attribution fraud. Our research showed that Mintegral was using code obfuscation and method swizzling to modify the functionality of base iOS SDK methods without the application owner’s knowledge. Further, our research proved that Mintegral was logging all HTTP requests including its headers which could even contain authorization tokens or other sensitive data.

Our discovery was widely reported across various press outlets and social media. As part of our research, we contacted the maintainers of some of the most popular apps that were affected by this SDK to inform them of our findings. We worked with a number of developers who asked for additional information and assistance in understanding the potential threats to their apps.

Since that time Mintegral announced that they were opening the source of their SDK to the market. While the SDK can (as of this writing) only be downloaded by registered partners, a major game publisher shared the source code with us for further analysis. We’ve also continued our research by digging deeper into the Android versions of the SDK in which we hadn’t found similar behaviors at the time of our initial disclosure.

This has resulted in some significant discoveries that necessitate an update to our previous disclosure. Additionally, Mintegral and the community at large have responded to the situation, and we felt a summary of the events was a good way to finalize our research into this SDK.

## **New iOS findings**

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

After Mintegral announced they were making their SDK open source, we analyzed the changes they made between the previous version that we had analyzed and the new version they released as open source. Through this comparison, we found significant changes that removed dangerous functionality that had existed in the previous versions. Most notably, we discovered a backdoor which previously allowed Mintegral to invoke any native static method within the application, but could also lead Mintegral to remotely execute code on any device displaying an ad through their SDK.

Not surprisingly, our analysis found that Mintegral removed the anti-debug and proxy detection that we had identified and [published in our previous disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/). However, through additional analysis we discovered they also removed six other classes that we hadn’t previously identified:

* `MTGCommandDispatcher`
* `MTGComponentCommands`
* `MTGRemoteCommand`
* `MTGRemoteCommandParameterModel`
* `MTGRemoteCommandParser`
* `MTGInvocationBoxing`

We found that `MTGBaseBridgeWebView`, which is used extensively in the SDK to communicate with JavaScript, introduces the ability to execute arbitrary functions and native application code. We were able to [build a proof of concept](/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/) that showed how the backdoor makes it possible for Mintegral to invoke any function and execute arbitrary code via the SDK. This is a significant compromise of device security model, and user’s privacy and stands in direct violation of Apple’s policy.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2Fn-mEMkeoUqs%2Fsddefault.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

We disclosed our new findings to Apple on October, 2nd and one day later, on October 3rd Apple sent out a notification to affected app developers sharing that their app is exposed to remote code execution through Mintegral’s SDK class. The notification asked app developers to fix the issue and publish a new version within a week for expedited review.

### HTTP request and OpenURL tracking

After our [previous disclosure](/blog/sourmint-malicious-code-ad-fraud-and-data-leak-in-ios/), Mintegral had disabled the data collection methods via their remote configuration functionality. However, in our subsequent research we found they’ve re-enabled that suspicious functionality a few weeks later. We observed this through several popular apps we initially sampled, but also confirmed this on a broader range of apps with the help of [NowSecure](https://www.nowsecure.com/).

The configuration served to the SDK during the initialization had all the 3 flags enabled:

* `cudl - HTTP request tracking`
* `cud - OpenURL tracking`
* `cspn - StoreKit methods tracking`

This means that for all apps with SDK older than 6.6.0.0, the extensive data collection and logging to Mintegral was active again. In many cases, this may happen without the developer’s consent, since this functionality of the SDK was always enabled, even if the developer or the mediation platform did not enable it.

## **Android SDK findings**

After completing our research and disclosure of the iOS SDK, our research team turned its attention to the Android versions. While initially we had seen indications that the Android version contained similar functionality, armed with this new information, a deeper inspection of the code resulted in new findings.  For all the technical details, please see the [technical research write up](/research/sour-mint-malicious-sdk/) of the Android version of the SDK.

First and foremost, the Snyk Research team found that various elements of the SDK code are being obfuscated using the same type of proprietary encoding mechanism that was used to obfuscate code in the iOS version of the SDK. Once again, while it looks similar to standard Base64 encoding, there are subtle differences that prevent using a typical Base64 encoder/decoder to decode the strings.

After using the SDK’s own internal utility to decode obfuscated strings and data, our researchers uncovered a number of methods that employ checks to determine if a debugger is running or if any type of intercepting proxy is running to capture network communications. As with the iOS version of the SDK, the logging behaviors of the Android SDK are switched off if either a debugger or network proxy is found. The same website the research team identified as the target for the logging of this data was also referenced in the Android SDK.

As the research team continued their investigation they were able to locate the implementation of a broadcast handler which listens for two intents. The first handler is part of the previously mentioned debug detection scheme. The second, `ACTION_PACKAGE_ADDED`, is fired when a new app is installed on the device. The code in the Mintegral SDK that runs as a result of this intent checks to see if a package was added. Ultimately, this allows the SDK to receive data on every application that gets installed on the device through the play store.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fsnyk%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1630413320%2Fwordpress-sync%2Fblog-code-mIntegral-sdk.png&w=2560&q=75)*Code of the onReceive() method in the mIntegral sdk*

However, the SDK goes further and is also able to gather information on other downloads that happen outside of the play store. The AlphabObserver class, which extends the ContentObserver class, contains a method that captures URIs that are opened on the device. The method parses the URI to ensure that it is a download request and then if it is not already in the SDK’s app database, it adds it.

Ultimately, the behaviors are similar to what was seen in the iOS version of the SDK. However, the key difference is that because the SDK listens for a broadcast intent, it is able to receive data for app installations that were not initiated through the parent app in which the SDK was included. Essentially, if even one app on a user’s device leverages the Mintegral SDK, that instance of the SDK has visibility into every app install or downloads that occur on the device. The following video shows how a URL of a Google doc opened on the device is sent back to Mintegral.

![](/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2Fo79R4fr2cho%2Fsddefault.jpg&w=2560&q=75)

Snyk has reported the details of our findings in the Mintegral SDK to Google who took the matter seriously and are continuing with their investigation. Google has confirmed that the technical analysis of the code that Snyk has provided is accurate. However, Google has not yet made any statement indicating if and how they intend to respond to the situation.

## **Community response**

Since our initial disclosure at the end of August, there has been considerable response from the ecosystem and the community. Mintregral, for their part, denied any wrongdoing. In a subsequent blog post, Mintegral indicated that the unusual level of data collection they perform was intended to help their SDK better tailor ads to the user. On or around August 26, 2020, Mintegral made a considerable number of changes to their privacy policy. In a later announcement, Mintegral shared that they were opening the source of their SDK to the market.

AppsFlyer and Singular, two major Mobile Measurement Providers (MMPs) responded with their [own analysis](https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/under-the-radar-fraud/) and implemented improvements to their anti-fraud product offerings to catch and prevent install hijacking attacks. Singular, released a [blog post](https://www.singular.net/blog/sourmint-ad-fraud/) titled “SourMint? Protecting yourself from click hijacking fraud on iOS”. In their post, they analyzed and found evidence of click hijacking activity in some SDK-based networks, and compared the rate of suspicious activity before and after our publication.

What they found was that before our disclosure, those apps showed a significant level of suspected hijacked clicks. However, after our disclosure was made public, they observed a dramatic decrease in fake clicks that happened within less than 24 hours from the publication time.

According to a notice on their website on September 3, 2020, Twitter’s mobile publishing and monetization platform MoPub removed mention of Mintegral as a network partner from their [announcement](https://www.mopub.com/en/blog/advanced_bidding_updates) originally published February 26, 2020. Additionally, in their [mediation documentation](https://developers.mopub.com/publishers/mediation/mopub-network-mediation/), MoPub now lists Mintegral as a deprecated network with the indication that it should be “removed from all inventory segments and line items”.

IronSource mediation platform also responded to the news of the SourMint disclosure. They stated:

> Recent reports raised serious allegations regarding Mintegral. ironSource conducted its own review, and, based on our findings, the ironSource mediation platform terminated all services and product support related to Mintegral.
>
> IronSource mediation platform

## **Conclusions**

Ultimately the situation with SourMint is very clear. It is undeniable that the Mintegral SDK uses various techniques to disguise the behavior of their SDK from developers, AppStore review, and independent security review. The hidden behaviors use techniques that allow the SDK to execute arbitrary code on iOS devices, and to access far greater data on user activity that would be necessary for ad attribution, exposing potentially private information to Mintegral. This data is accessed outside of the SDK itself making its collection very suspicious.

Throughout the years, the Snyk Security Research team has [identified and responsibly disclosed](/disclosed-vulnerabilities/) thousands of [vulnerabilities](/research/zip-slip-vulnerability/) in open source packages, [flagged](/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/) the [malicious backdoor](/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/) in the very popular event-stream npm package, and covered several [other](/blog/malicious-packages-found-to-be-typo-squatting-in-pypi/) cases of [malicious components](/blog/publishing-malicious-packages/). Concluding the SourMint research, we’re happy to see the impact of our work, including the functionality we identified and disclosed being removed from the SDK, click hijacking and attribution fraud stopping, and the SDK getting open-sourced. Finally, we’re happy to see the increased awareness of the issue in the mobile development community, including companies in the mobile advertising world acting quickly to protect their users

For application developers, this highlights a need to ensure the trustworthiness of the monetization platforms they choose to use. Even with detailed code-level analysis, it can be very difficult to spot malicious or unanticipated behaviors. Responsibility for user notification of data collection ultimately falls on the application developer, so unknowingly including SDKs that access significant amounts of data such as this can cause the application owner to run afoul of app store policies. We hope that this disclosure has helped shed light on the bigger picture and that application developers have now greater awareness of the necessary steps to protect the private data of their users.

[00:00] hey there in this video we'll show a
[00:02] demonstration of the remote code
[00:03] execution capability
[00:05] found in the mtg invocation boxing class
[00:08] provided by the mintricle sdk
[00:12] during this video we'll be using an
[00:14] application running on a real ios
[00:16] device that uses the integral add sdk
[00:19] the app will be blurred for privacy
[00:21] reasons
[00:22] the malicious payload that we will
[00:24] execute can either come from the mental
[00:26] server
[00:27] or the advertising banner itself we'll
[00:29] be using an
[00:30] ngrok url to replace the integral server
[00:33] by exposing our own
[00:34] local server to the internet we spin up
[00:37] our own
[00:38] http server to serve the malicious ad
[00:41] banner
[00:41] running in the app on the device as soon
[00:44] as the game loads our own malicious
[00:46] banner at the bottom of this app
[00:48] we can see the idfa of the device has
[00:50] been sent to our server logs
[00:52] it looks like this banner is doing some
[00:54] nasty things we'll take a break from the
[00:57] app to look at some sensitive
[00:58] information
[00:59] such as this password manager i'm going
[01:02] to copy the password
[01:03] as i want to use it later but with this
[01:05] sensitive information in my clipboard
[01:07] let's head back to the game as soon as
[01:09] we open it
[01:10] the malicious ad banner uses the remote
[01:12] code execution inside the mental stk
[01:16] to run malicious code that steals the
[01:18] password data from the clipboard
[01:20] and sends it back to our evil server
[01:23] to find out more about salomon visit the
[01:26] snick research site for more information
[01:28] thanks for watching and stay secure

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
