  "CVE-2020-7787": {
    "Description": "It is possible for a specially crafted JWT token and request URL can cause the nonce, session and refresh values to be incorrectly validated, causing the application to treat an attacker-generated JWT token as authentic.",
    "Root cause": "The nonce, session and refresh values are stored in the browser local storage or session storage. Each key is automatically appended by `||`. When the received nonce and session keys are generated, the list of values is stored in the browser storage, separated by `||`, with `||` always appended to the end of the list. Since `||` will always be the last 2 characters of the stored values, an empty string (`\"\"`) will always be in the list of the valid values.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can generate a JWT token that the application will treat as authentic, bypassing authentication.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a specific JWT token and request URL.  The attacker also needs to be able to send a request with an empty session parameter in the callback URL, and a specially-crafted JWT token with an empty string (`\"\"`) as the nonce value.",
    "Affected component": "react-adal versions < 0.5.1"
  }
