Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `loadString` function in `scratch-svg-renderer` does not properly sanitize SVG input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary elements into the DOM through the `_transformMeasurements` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the application fails to escape special characters in SVG input, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can lead to:
*   Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
*   Exposing sensitive information.
*   Gaining access to privileged services and functionalities.
*   Delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `loadString` function, which processes unsanitized SVG input. This could be achieved through:
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious SVG that is delivered to a user through a link. When the user clicks the link, the malicious SVG is processed by the vulnerable application and the script is executed in the user's browser.
*  The vulnerability is in the `scratch-svg-renderer` library, which is a client-side component, so this could also be exploited through **DOM-based XSS**.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SVG string as input to the `loadString` function.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into loading the malicious SVG string in a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `scratch-svg-renderer` package, specifically affecting versions **<0.2.0-prerelease.20201019174008**.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading to version 0.2.0-prerelease.20201019174008 or higher, which includes a fix to sanitize the SVG input using `DOMPurify`.
*   The provided content also includes information about the different types of XSS attacks (stored, reflected, DOM-based, mutated) and common mitigation strategies, such as sanitizing user inputs, encoding special characters, and implementing a Content Security Policy.
*   The provided GitHub commit ([https://github.com/LLK/scratch-svg-renderer/commit/9ebf57588aa596c4fa3bb64209e10ade395aee90](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-svg-renderer/commit/9ebf57588aa596c4fa3bb64209e10ade395aee90)) demonstrates the changes made to address this vulnerability. Specifically, the commit shows the integration of the `DOMPurify` library to sanitize SVG input before rendering.

**CVSS Score:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as **critical** with a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.6.
*   The attack vector is Network, the attack complexity is Low, no privileges are required, and user interaction is required. The scope is changed, and the impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is high.
