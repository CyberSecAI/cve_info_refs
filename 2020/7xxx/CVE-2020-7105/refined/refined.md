Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7105:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to check return values of `malloc` and similar memory allocation functions in `hiredis`. When memory allocation fails, these functions return a NULL pointer. The code then proceeds to dereference these NULL pointers, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is dereferencing NULL pointers in multiple locations within the `hiredis` library:
    - `async.c:61`: When `malloc` fails, the code attempts to `memcpy` to the potentially NULL `dup` pointer.
    - `dict.c:75`: If `malloc` fails, the code calls `_dictInit` with the NULL `ht` pointer.
    - `dict.c:146`: If `malloc` fails, the code attempts to access `entry->next` where entry is NULL.
    - `dict.c:261`: If `malloc` fails, the code attempts to access `iter->ht` where iter is NULL.
- **Missing Error Handling:** The code lacks proper checks for NULL return values from memory allocation functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a program crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any operation that causes `hiredis` to allocate memory, and where memory allocation can fail. This is not directly controllable by an attacker, but is indirectly achievable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need a specific position. Any user or program utilizing the vulnerable `hiredis` library can trigger this vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability simply by interacting with the program or service using a vulnerable version of `hiredis` such that the `malloc` can fail (e.g. by exhausting system memory).
