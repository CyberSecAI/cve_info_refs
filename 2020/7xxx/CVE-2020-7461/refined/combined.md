FreeBSD-SA-20:26.dhclient Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: dhclient heap overflow
Category: core
Module: dhclient
Announced: 2020-09-02
Credits: Shlomi Oberman, JSOF
Moshe Kol, JSOF
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2020-08-31 21:28:09 UTC (stable/12, 12.1-STABLE)
2020-09-02 16:25:31 UTC (releng/12.1, 12.1-RELEASE-p9)
2020-08-31 21:28:57 UTC (stable/11, 11.4-STABLE)
2020-09-02 16:25:31 UTC (releng/11.4, 11.4-RELEASE-p3)
2020-09-02 16:25:31 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p13)
CVE Name: CVE-2020-7461
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
dhclient(8) is the default IPv4 DHCP client used on FreeBSD. It is
responsible for contacting DHCP servers on a network segment, and for
initializing and configuring network interfaces and configuring name
resolution based on received information.
dhclient(8) handles DHCP option 119, the Domain Search Option, which provides
a list of domains to search when resolving names using DNS. The option data
format uses a compression scheme to avoid transmitting duplicate domain name
labels.
II. Problem Description
When parsing option 119 data, dhclient(8) computes the uncompressed domain
list length so that it can allocate an appropriately sized buffer to store
the uncompressed list. The code to compute the length failed to handle
certain malformed input, resulting in a heap overflow when the uncompressed
list is copied into in inadequately sized buffer.
III. Impact
The heap overflow could in principle be exploited to achieve remote code
execution. The affected process runs with reduced privileges in a Capsicum
sandbox, limiting the immediate impact of an exploit. However, it is
possible the bug could be combined with other vulnerabilities to escape the
sandbox.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. To trigger the bug, a system must be running
dhclient(8) on the same network as a malicious DHCP server.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date, and
restart dhclient or reboot.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
# shutdown -r +10min "Rebooting for a security update"
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:26/dhclient.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-20:26/dhclient.patch.asc
# gpg --verify dhclient.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.

SUMMARY

A heap overﬂow vulnerability in dhclient of the affected products, which has been published alongside
other vulnerabilities as part of NAME:WRECK could allow an attacker to potentially remotely execute
code.

Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use trusted DNS servers in internal network, and restrict DNS trafﬁc to this network only through

ﬁrewalls.

• Protect network access to affected devices.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC RFx50M are handheld RFID reader/writer terminals with application software for customizing
RFID tags.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7461

In FreeBSD 12.1-STABLE before r365010, 11.4-STABLE before r365011, 12.1-RELEASE before
p9, 11.4-RELEASE before p3, and 11.3-RELEASE before p13, dhclient(8) fails to handle certain
malformed input related to handling of DHCP option 119 resulting a heap overﬂow. The heap overﬂow
could in principle be exploited to achieve remote code execution. The affected process runs with
reduced privileges in a Capsicum sandbox, limiting the immediate impact of an exploit.
