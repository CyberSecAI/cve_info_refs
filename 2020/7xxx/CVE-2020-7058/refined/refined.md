The provided content describes a vulnerability in Cacti, which aligns with the description of CVE-2020-7058.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an input validation error in the `data_input.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the "Input String" field of a data input method that uses the `Script/Command` input type.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation, specifically when handling user-provided strings for `Script/Command` type data inputs.
- Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.
- Allows modification of commands executed by the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE). By injecting malicious code into the `Input String` field, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Complete control over the server, allowing the attacker to take down the system, or use the system for other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Cacti web interface via the `Data Input Methods` configuration page.
- Specifically, by editing an existing `Script/Command` type data input method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authorized user with access to the Cacti web interface and the ability to edit `Data Input Methods`.
- The attacker needs to know how to inject code into the `Input String` field for a command/script.
