The provided content describes multiple address bar spoofing vulnerabilities in various mobile browsers, including Bolt Browser, which is associated with CVE-2020-7370.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from inconsistencies in how mobile browsers handle page loads and address bar updates, specifically when JavaScript manipulates the timing between these actions. By exploiting these timing issues, an attacker can make a browser display a spoofed URL in the address bar while rendering content from a different, potentially malicious, source.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core weakness is the lack of proper synchronization between the displayed URL in the address bar and the actual location of the content being rendered.
- Specifically for Bolt Browser, the vulnerability stems from a failure to properly update the address bar when JavaScript manipulates the page loading process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to convincingly spoof the origin of content, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- Users may be tricked into entering credentials or other sensitive information on a page that appears to be legitimate but is actually controlled by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious websites containing JavaScript that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker would need to lure the victim to visit the malicious page (e.g., via phishing emails, text messages, or malicious links).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host malicious web content with embedded JavaScript to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to visit the malicious page.

**Specifics for CVE-2020-7370 (Bolt Browser):**
- The vulnerability affects Bolt Browser version 1.4 on iOS.
- The fix status is that the support email bounced and Apple was alerted.
- The exploit for Bolt Browser involves using JavaScript to manipulate the timing of page loads and URL updates, spoofing the address bar.
- A specific code snippet showcasing the vulnerability for a variety of browsers, including Bolt, is given as:
```html
<script>
function spoof()
{
var gmail = 'PCFET0NC8+KArOK........ZHk+PC9odG1sPg=='; //The
base64 encoded version of the Gmail page

x=document.body.innerHTML=atob(gmail);
document.write("<title>Gmail</title>");
document.write("x");
window.location.assign("https://www.Gmail.com:8080");
}
setInterval(spoof(),100000);
</script>
```
This script loads base64 encoded HTML of the Gmail page and then redirects to a spoofed URL of gmail.com on port 8080.

The vulnerability class is mentioned as CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information), and the CVSS is around 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
