Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7701:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `setValue` function of the `madlib-object-utils` package. This function allows setting values on an object, but it does not properly prevent modification of the prototype, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution, which allows an attacker to modify the properties of the `Object.prototype`. This can have far-reaching consequences because `Object.prototype` is the ancestor of all JavaScript objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by polluting the prototype and causing unexpected behavior in the application. The Snyk analysis shows a high impact on availability due to this issue.
- While the provided information states "There is no loss of confidentiality or integrity", prototype pollution can be a stepping stone to other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network**.  This means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't require any privileges and user interaction is not required to exploit the vulnerability. The attack complexity is low, meaning it's easily repeatable.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable package is `madlib-object-utils` versions less than `0.1.7`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version `0.1.7`.
- Snyk provides a proof of concept (POC) demonstrating the vulnerability:
```javascript
const objectUtils = require("madlib-object-utils");
objectUtils.setValue('__proto__.polluted', {}, true);
console.log(polluted);
```
- Snyk's CVSS score for the vulnerability is 7.5 (High), while NVD's CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical). This may reflect differing analyses and considerations.

This information is more detailed than a simple CVE description, as it explains the specific function at fault, provides a proof of concept, and gives a remediation strategy.
