### @Hbkhan **[Hbkhan](/Hbkhan)** commented [Jun 23, 2020](#issue-644147860) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

## ‚úçÔ∏è Description

Affected versions allow an attacker to execute remote commands. The issue occurs because `tagName` user input is formatted inside the `exec` function in [#L64](https://github.com/mikaelbr/mversion/blob/a9ddbc2bc86eb48f6976b85d195b6a94e81ffb22/lib/git.js#L64) is executed without any checks.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Proof of Concept

```
// poc.js
// node poc.js

var mversion = require('mversion');

mversion.update({
       version: "major",
       commitMessage: "testing",
       tagName: "; touch hbkhan",
 })
```
## üí• Impact

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Contact

This is the initial disclosure

## ‚úÖ Checklist

**In my pull request, I have:**

* *Created and populated the `README.md` and `vulnerability.json` files*

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 24 Jun 2020

[CVE-2020-7688 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7688) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-78 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `mversion` to version 2.0.1 or higher.

## Overview

[mversion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mversion) is a cross packaging manager module version handler/bumper.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection. The issue occurs because `tagName` user input is formatted inside the `exec` function is executed without any checks.

### PoC:

```
var mversion = require('mversion');

mversion.update({
       version: "major",
       commitMessage: "testing",
       tagName: "; touch hbkhan",
 })

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.4¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack and the attacker's path is via read/write/execute capabilities.

  **Local**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you‚Äôve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within¬†[Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we‚Äôll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found¬†[here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at¬†report@snyk.io.
