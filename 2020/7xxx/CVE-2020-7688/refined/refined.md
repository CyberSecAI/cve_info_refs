Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7688:

**Root Cause:**
- The `mversion` npm package was vulnerable to command injection.
- The `tagName` user input was directly incorporated into the `exec` function without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands through the `tagName` parameter. This occurs in the `lib/git.js` file, specifically at line 64.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a client of the `mversion` library uses untrusted input for `tagName`, an attacker could achieve RCE on the server or environment where the library is being executed. The injected commands will be executed with the permissions of the running process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-controlled input:** The attacker crafts a malicious string and includes it as the `tagName` parameter when calling the `mversion.update` function or other affected functions.
- The code uses `exec` function from nodejs which allows system command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `tagName` parameter of the vulnerable function call in the `mversion` library. This may be through a web interface, configuration file or any mechanism that passes untrusted data to the library.

**Additional Details:**
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) provided demonstrates the vulnerability using the following code snippet:
  ```javascript
    var mversion = require('mversion');

    mversion.update({
           version: "major",
           commitMessage: "testing",
           tagName: "; touch hbkhan",
    })
  ```
   This PoC shows that by injecting `; touch hbkhan` into the tagName, it creates a file named "hbkhan" in the current directory.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1 by escaping the quotes in the `tagName` before passing it to the `exec` function using the function `escapeQuotes`.
- The CVSS score from Snyk is 8.4 High.
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)

In summary, the vulnerability in `mversion` allows for command injection due to unsanitized user input, leading to potential remote code execution if an application uses the library with untrusted data for the `tagName`.
