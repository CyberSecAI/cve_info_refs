Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7045:

**Root Cause:**
- A null-dereference read vulnerability exists in the BT ATT dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a null-dereference, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory via a null pointer, leading to a crash.
- The vulnerability lies within the Bluetooth Attribute (BT ATT) dissector, which is responsible for parsing and interpreting Bluetooth ATT protocol data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause Wireshark to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a malformed Bluetooth packet onto the network (the wire).
- An attacker could also cause the crash by providing a malformed packet trace file to a user, which they would open with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to inject a malformed Bluetooth packet onto the wire, or create a malformed packet trace file.
- No specific position is mentioned. However, it is implied that the attacker needs to have some network access to inject the crafted Bluetooth packets.
