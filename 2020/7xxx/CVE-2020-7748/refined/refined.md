Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7748

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `deepExtend` function within the `@tsed/core` package. This function, used for deep merging objects, is susceptible to prototype pollution when processing user-controlled input. Specifically, when the source object in the merge contains a `__proto__` property, the function incorrectly attempts to merge this onto the `Object.prototype`, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the `Object.prototype`, which affects all JavaScript objects.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The `deepExtend` function does not properly handle the `__proto__` property during the merge process.
- **Reliance on User Input:** If user input is used as the source object in the `deepExtend` function, an attacker can inject the malicious `__proto__` property.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, an attacker can cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably due to JavaScript exceptions.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application evaluates a polluted property, such as by using `eval`, this can potentially lead to RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious properties that can affect security measures or logic of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload containing the `__proto__` property with a value they wish to inject.
- The attacker provides this crafted payload as input to the vulnerable `deepExtend` function, which processes it and pollutes the prototype.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `deepExtend` function within the vulnerable application.
- This typically means they need to be able to control or manipulate data that is used in the deep merge operation.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by providing a crafted JSON object with `__proto__` property to `deepExtends` function.
- The fix involved replacing `Object.keys` with `objectKeys` function which is presumably safer and mitigates the pollution, as seen in the provided github commit diff.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution').
