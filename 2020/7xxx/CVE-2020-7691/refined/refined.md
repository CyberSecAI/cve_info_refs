Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `jspdf` library when processing HTML content via the `fromHTML` function. The filtering regex in the affected versions of the library can be bypassed by using a crafted payload such as `<<script>script>`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the failure to properly sanitize user-provided HTML input before rendering it into a PDF. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Inadequate Input Filtering:** The filtering mechanism used in the `fromHTML` function is not robust enough, allowing bypass with specific payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when the generated PDF is viewed in a web browser.
- **Cookie Stealing & Session Hijacking:** The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies and hijack user sessions.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information.
- **Access to Privileged Services:** Attackers could gain access to privileged services or functionality.
- **Malware Delivery:** XSS can be used to deliver malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML string containing JavaScript code (e.g., `<<script>script>document.write(window.location);</script>`).
- **`fromHTML` Function:** This crafted HTML is then passed to the vulnerable `fromHTML` function within the `jspdf` library.
- **PDF Generation:** The `jspdf` library creates a PDF from the HTML content without proper sanitization.
- **PDF Viewing:** When a user opens the generated PDF in a web browser, the malicious script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Malicious HTML:** The attacker must be able to inject malicious HTML content into the application that utilizes the vulnerable `jspdf` library.
- **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability requires a user to open the maliciously crafted PDF file in a web browser for the XSS payload to be triggered.

**Affected Packages and Versions**
The vulnerability affects different packages using `jspdf`

- `org.webjars.bowergithub.mrrio:jspdf` versions < 2.3.1
- `org.webjars.npm:jspdf` versions < 2.2.0
- `org.webjars.bower:jspdf` versions < 2.3.1
- `org.webjars:jspdf` all versions
- `jspdf` npm package versions < 2.0.0

**Mitigation:**
The primary mitigation is to upgrade the affected packages to the following versions or higher:
- `org.webjars.bowergithub.mrrio:jspdf` to version 2.3.1 or higher
- `org.webjars.npm:jspdf` to version 2.2.0 or higher
- `org.webjars.bower:jspdf` to version 2.3.1 or higher
- `jspdf` npm package to version 2.0.0 or higher

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept and provides a detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 6.3 (Medium) according to Snyk and 6.1 (Medium) according to NVD
