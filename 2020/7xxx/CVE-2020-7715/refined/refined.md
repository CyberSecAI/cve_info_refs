  "cve": "CVE-2020-7715",
  "description": "The deep-get-set package before 1.1.1 for Node.js allows prototype pollution. The main function can be abused to inject properties into the Object prototype by using a crafted input with a `__proto__` property.",
  "affected_versions": "<1.1.1",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to inject properties into the prototype of the base JavaScript Object using a crafted input containing the `__proto__` property.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Prototype Pollution"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can manipulate the `__proto__` property of an object to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application's object prototype, potentially leading to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "The main function of the deep-get-set library is vulnerable when it processes a crafted input containing a `__proto__` property."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `deep-get-set` function, specifically the path argument, to inject a property to the prototype chain. No prior privileges are required.",
  "poc": "```javascript\nconst deep = require('deep-get-set');\ndeep({}, ['__proto__', 'polluted'], true);\nconsole.log(polluted);\n```"
