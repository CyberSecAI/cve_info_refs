The vulnerability occurs when creating HTML output from an Excel file with a comment containing malicious JavaScript. The HTML writer concatenates user comments as part of a link, which is then returned as HTML without proper sanitization. The provided PoC demonstrates how to trigger the XSS by inserting a `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload into an Excel cell comment. The fix is to upgrade the phpoffice/phpspreadsheet package to version 1.16.0 or higher."
