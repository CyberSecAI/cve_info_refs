Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an uncontrolled search path element, leading to a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The software does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL in a location searched by the application. This is also known as a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Remote Code Execution:** A successful attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Compromised Availability and Confidentiality**: The attacker could compromise the systemâ€™s availability and gain access to confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected system.
- **No user interaction required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction, but requires user level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have user level privileges.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue where the software loads DLL files from an uncontrolled search path. This allows a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges by placing a malicious DLL in a location searched by the application.
