- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could perform privileged operations on behalf of the user, gain access to sensitive user data, and potentially execute arbitrary code remotely. This could also lead to information disclosure and limiting system availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the web interface. The attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires the ability to inject malicious code into the web interface.  The attacker also needs high privileges (PR:H) to inject malicious scripts, and user interaction (UI:R) is needed for the exploit to work on the victim's side.
