Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7581:

**Root Cause:**
- A component within the affected applications calls a helper binary during startup. The call path for this helper binary is not properly quoted.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428):** The lack of quotes around the helper binary's path allows an attacker to potentially insert a malicious executable at a higher-priority location in the search path (e.g., C:\Program.exe, C:\Program Files\Common.exe, or C:\Program Files\Common Files\Siemens\Automation\Simatic.exe).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with administrative privileges can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create or modify files in specific directories on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker must have local administrative privileges on the affected system.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker must be able to write to the system's file system to place a malicious executable at a higher-priority location.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the startup of the affected application when it calls a helper binary.
- The advisory lists specific locations where malicious executables can be placed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Specific workarounds involve ensuring no executables are located at  `C:\Program.exe`, `C:\Program Files\Common.exe`, or `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Siemens\Automation\Simatic.exe`
