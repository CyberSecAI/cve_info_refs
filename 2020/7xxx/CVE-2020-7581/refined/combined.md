Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.7

2020-07-14
2022-08-09
V1.9

SUMMARY

The products listed below contain two security vulnerabilities in the UMC component that could allow an
attacker to cause a partial denial-of-service of the UMC component, or to locally escalate privileges from
a user with administrative privileges to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Have the software running on systems within trusted networks
• CVE-2020-7581: Make sure that there is no executable at the following locations: C:\Program.exe,
C:\Program Files\Common.exe, or C:\Program Files\Common Files\Siemens\Automation\Simatic.exe

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Opcenter Execution Discrete (formerly known as "SIMATIC IT Uniﬁed Architecture Discrete Manufac-
turing") is a specialized Manufacturing Execution System addressing the needs of the discrete industry
market, focusing on job-shop part manufacturing and complex manual assembly.

SIMATIC IT Uniﬁed Architecture Foundation (SIT UAF) is a framework to build and run state-of-the-art
manufacturing operations management (MOM) applications.

Opcenter Execution Process (formerly known as "SIMATIC IT Uniﬁed Architecture Process Industries") is
Siemens’ MES system for the CPG and Process industries. Based on the latest technology, it enables to
implement the strategy for the complete digitalization of manufacturing.

Opcenter Intelligence (formerly known as "Manufacturing Intelligence") connects, organizes and aggre-
gates manufacturing data from disparate company sources into cohesive, intelligent and contextualized
information.

Opcenter Quality is a quality management system (QMS) that enables organizations to safeguard
compliance, optimize quality, reduce defect and rework costs and achieve operational excellence by
increasing process stability. The integrated process capabilities (control charts, statistics, quality gates)
can detect production errors to avoid further processing and shipment of nonconforming material.

Opcenter RD&L (formerly known as "SIMATIC IT R&D Suite") offers companies in CPG and process
industries a scalable and ﬂexible platform to streamline, optimize, and align all formulated product data
management.

SIMATIC IT Line Monitoring System is designed to monitor plant ﬂoor performance, blending real-time and
transactional systems, for a line visibility & control. This line-monitoring capability allows manufacturers to
increase production efﬁciency, as well as optimize performance, use reporting to their best advantage,
and reduce line inefﬁciencies, while incrementing product yields. Line Monitoring System within SIMATIC
IT allows for automatic and real-time collection of production relevant data directly from the factory ﬂoor.

SIMATIC IT Production Suite is a plant-centric IT solution building the link between Business Systems
(e.g. ERP) and Control Systems.

SIMATIC Notiﬁer monitors data and sends notiﬁcations based on conﬁgurated events for access from
anywhere.

SIMATIC PCS neo is a distributed control system (DCS).

SIMOCODE ES is the central software package for the conﬁguration, commissioning, operation, and
diagnosis of SIMOCODE pro.

Soft Starter ES is the central software for conﬁguration, commissioning, operation and diagnostics of the
SIRIUS 3RW55, 3RW52 and 3RW44 soft starters.

The Totally Integrated Automation Portal (TIA Portal) is a PC software that provides access to the complete
range of Siemens digitalized automation services, from digital planning and integrated engineering to
transparent operation.

User Management Component (UMC) is an integrating component that enables system-wide, central
maintenance of users.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7581

A component within the affected application calls a helper binary with SYSTEM privileges during
startup while the call path is not quoted. This could allow a local attacker with administrative privileges
to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.

CWE-428: Unquoted Search Path or Element

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7587

Sending multiple specially crafted packets to the affected service could cause a partial remote
denial-of-service, that would cause the service to restart itself.

On some cases the vulnerability could leak random information from the remote service.
