Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7638:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `setDeepProperty` function within the `confinit` package. This function is designed to set values on an object based on a given path. However, it does not properly sanitize the provided `propertyPath`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `setDeepProperty` function can be tricked into modifying the `Object.prototype` by using a `__proto__` payload within the `propertyPath`. This occurs because the function doesn't properly validate or sanitize the property path. This allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes.
-  The vulnerability is caused by the library defining a function `setDeepProperty(obj, propertyPath, value)` that allows to set a value in an object based on the given path, but does not validate the path.
-  If an attacker controls the propertyPath, it can set it to `__proto__.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned to the prototype of the class of the object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype`, attackers can modify properties used by generic functions (e.g., `toString`, `valueOf`). Altering these properties to unexpected values can cause code to fail, leading to a DoS.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, if the code evaluates a specific polluted attribute and executes it (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), the attacker could achieve remote code execution.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties that the code relies on, potentially including security-sensitive properties (e.g., cookies or tokens). This could lead to privilege escalation if the code relies on properties like `isAdmin` to determine user authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `setDeepProperty` function. An attacker would need to control the `propertyPath` argument to insert the `__proto__` payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `setDeepProperty` function, specifically the `propertyPath` parameter.
- The attacker could be positioned as a client providing input to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Snyk vulnerability report includes a proof-of-concept code snippet demonstrating how the `__proto__` payload can be used to pollute the prototype.
- The report also explains the underlying mechanisms of prototype pollution, including recursive merge attacks and property definition by path.
- The fix is to upgrade `confinit` to version 0.4.0 or higher.
