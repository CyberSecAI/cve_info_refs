Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from two main issues:
1.  **Lack of username sanitization:** Usernames were not properly sanitized during registration, allowing the inclusion of leading or trailing spaces. This could lead to an attacker registering a username with spaces that visually appears the same as another user's username.
2.  **Password reset using usernames:** The password reset functionality used usernames instead of email addresses to generate reset tokens. This, combined with the lack of username sanitization, allowed an attacker to potentially take over accounts by registering an account with a username that had leading or trailing spaces that were similar to another users' username.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system failed to properly validate and sanitize user input, specifically usernames, during the registration process.
*   **Insecure Password Reset Mechanism:** The password reset mechanism relied on usernames, which were vulnerable to manipulation, instead of unique and less user-controlled identifiers such as email addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could take over other user accounts by registering a similar looking username with spaces and then using the password reset functionality using the manipulated username to gain access to the other user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Registration:** An attacker would register an account with a username that has leading or trailing spaces that appear to be similar to a target user's username.
*   **Password Reset:** An attacker would then initiate a password reset for the target user, but because the system was using usernames instead of emails, it would generate a reset token for the manipulated username. The attacker could use this token to reset the password of the target account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to register a new account:** The attacker needs to be able to register a new account on the CTFd instance.
*   **Knowledge of a target user's username:** The attacker must know or be able to guess a target user's username to create a visually similar username.
*   **Access to the password reset functionality**: The attacker must have access to the application's password reset functionality.

**Additional Details from Content:**
* The vulnerability was considered a critical security fix for CTFd versions >= 2.0.0
* The fix involved:
   - Stripping spaces from usernames during registration checks.
   - Using email addresses instead of usernames for password reset tokens.
   - Preventing users associated with a specific platform (MLC users) from resetting their passwords.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-7245.
