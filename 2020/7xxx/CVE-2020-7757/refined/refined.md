Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Path Traversal issue in the `droppy` package. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths when creating file paths for zipping and serving file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application fails to prevent attackers from using ".." sequences or absolute paths to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, such as configuration files, by exploiting the path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Loss:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration files. This could include credentials, private keys, and other sensitive information that could compromise the server or its connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing ".." sequences in the URI, an attacker can traverse the directory structure on the server. The specific request involves accessing the `zip` endpoint (`/!/zip/`) followed by path traversal characters to reach the target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `droppy` application, which is a remotely exploitable vulnerability.
- No prior authentication is required. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to access a configuration file.
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `droppy` package. There are no fixed versions at the time of the vulnerability disclosure.
- Snyk assigned the vulnerability ID `SNYK-JS-DROPPY-1023656`.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
