Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7210:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the Umbraco CMS. The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent. This is due to the lack of proper token verification in the requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform arbitrary web requests with the identity of a victim. Specifically, the attacker can:
  - Enable/disable user accounts.
  - Delete user accounts, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) of user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that targets the vulnerable endpoints in the Umbraco CMS.
- The victim, who needs to be an authenticated user (admin), is tricked into visiting this malicious page.
- When the victim visits the page, the browser automatically sends the forged request along with the victim's session cookies to the vulnerable Umbraco CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user (admin) into visiting this page.
- The attacker does not need to know the victim's credentials or session cookies, as these are automatically included in the forged request by the browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Umbraco CMS version 8.2.2.
- The fix was included in version 8.5 of the CMS.
- The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab in October 2019, and reported to the vendor.
- The advisory also contains specific proof-of-concept HTML code snippets for disabling, enabling, and deleting users. These PoCs target the following endpoints:
  - `/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDisableUsers`
  - `/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostEnableUsers`
  - `/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDeleteNonLoggedInUser`
