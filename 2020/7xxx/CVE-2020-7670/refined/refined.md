Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7670:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-7670, detailing an HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability in the `agoo` Ruby gem.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers in HTTP requests. Specifically, the `agoo` server:
  - Does not reject requests with multiple `Content-Length` headers.
  - Accepts malformed `Transfer-Encoding` headers (e.g., with extra spaces, CRLF characters, or incorrect values).
  - Doesn't properly prioritize `Transfer-Encoding` over `Content-Length` when both are present.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The primary vulnerability is HTTP request smuggling due to the server's lax parsing of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
*   **Malformed Header Handling:** The server does not enforce strict adherence to RFC 7230 regarding header formats. Specifically, it does not reject requests with:
    *   Multiple `Content-Length` headers.
    *   Malformed `Transfer-Encoding` headers with extra spaces, CRLF, or incorrect values like `chunk` or `ch--nked`, etc.
*   **Improper Header Prioritization:** The server fails to ignore the `Content-Length` header when a `Transfer-Encoding` header is also present, as required by RFC 7230.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Request Smuggling:** An attacker can inject malicious requests into a connection between the `agoo` server and a downstream server.
*   **Varying Impacts:** Depending on the specific application logic and server setup, this could potentially result in various attacks, including:
    *   Bypassing security controls
    *   Cache poisoning
    *   XSS attacks
    *   Session hijacking

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `agoo` server.
*   These requests include malformed or conflicting `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, which are not correctly parsed by `agoo`.
*   The attack is possible when `agoo` is used as part of a chain of backend servers.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the `agoo` server.
*   **No Prior Privileges:** No prior authentication or access to the server is required.
*   **Knowledge of the HTTP Protocol:** The attacker needs to have a good understanding of the HTTP protocol, especially the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers and request smuggling techniques.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description as it provides specific examples of malformed headers and explains how they lead to request smuggling.
* The fix implemented in version 2.14.0 includes rejecting requests with multiple Content-Length headers, and enforcing correct parsing of transfer encoding headers.
* The issue was reported by Sam Sanoop of Snyk Security Team.

In summary, CVE-2020-7670 is an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in the `agoo` Ruby gem due to improper parsing of request headers. This can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious requests, potentially resulting in various security impacts.
