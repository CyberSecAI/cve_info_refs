Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7768:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a prototype pollution issue in the `loadPackageDefinition` function of the `grpc` library. This function is vulnerable to property injection through the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The application is vulnerable to prototype pollution, a type of vulnerability specific to JavaScript. This vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the prototype of base JavaScript objects.
- Unsafe Object Handling: The `loadPackageDefinition` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing the injection of properties like `__proto__`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting the `Object.prototype` with unexpected values (e.g. changing the `toString` function to an integer), an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to denial of service.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): In certain situations where the codebase evaluates a specific object attribute, an attacker can leverage prototype pollution to inject and execute arbitrary code by modifying the prototype.
- Property Injection: The attacker can manipulate properties the application relies on such as security tokens or cookies, potentially escalating privileges

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `loadPackageDefinition` function. By providing a crafted input object with a `__proto__` property, an attacker can modify the prototype of the base `Object`.
- This is a client-side attack, meaning it occurs within the context of the application using the vulnerable library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the input to the `loadPackageDefinition` function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of the `grpc` library, including the main `grpc` package, `@grpc/grpc-js`, and `org.webjars.npm:grpc`.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability in versions 1.24.4 and higher for `grpc`, 1.1.8 or higher for `@grpc/grpc-js`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a simple proof-of-concept (POC):
```javascript
const { loadPackageDefinition } = require('grpc');
loadPackageDefinition({'__proto__.polluted': true});
console.log(polluted);
```
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) by Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) by NVD.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-1321 which describes improper handling of a special element.
