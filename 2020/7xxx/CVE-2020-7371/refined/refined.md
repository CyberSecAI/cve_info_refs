Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-7371:

**Verification:**

The content from both `www.rafaybaloch.com` and `blog.rapid7.com` directly relate to CVE-2020-7371. The Rapid7 blog post explicitly mentions CVE-2020-7371 in the context of address bar spoofing in RITS Browser for Android. The rafaybaloch.com article also discusses this issue as part of a larger set of address bar spoofing vulnerabilities found in multiple mobile browsers, and lists RITS browser as affected.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is inconsistent handling of URL loading and address bar updates within the RITS browser. Specifically, the browser can be tricked into displaying a different URL in the address bar than the actual content being loaded. This is achieved through JavaScript that manipulates the page load timing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

The core vulnerability is an address bar spoofing issue, categorized as CWE-451 (User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information). The browser fails to maintain a consistent link between the displayed address bar and the actual resource being loaded and displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to make malicious websites appear as legitimate, trusted sites, increasing the success rate of phishing attacks designed to steal credentials, distribute malware or conduct financial fraud.
*   **User Deception:** Users can be tricked into trusting a website that is not what it appears to be, leading to potentially harmful interactions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves enticing victims to visit a website controlled by the attacker.
*   **Javascript Manipulation:** Attackers use JavaScript to manipulate the timing of page loads and address bar updates, which allows a malicious webpage to display a legitimate URL in the address bar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers need the capability to host and deliver malicious HTML/JavaScript content.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers must use social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing emails/texts) to convince users to visit the malicious website or click a malicious link.
*   **No Special Browser Access:** The vulnerability exploits a browserâ€™s handling of Javascript and timing, and does not require special access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by Javascript that manipulates the timing between page loads and address bar refreshes.
*   The rapid7 blog post mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Rafay Baloch.
*   The vulnerability is not an code execution bug but an UI bug designed to trick the user.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed in 2020.
*   The RITS browser is a less common browser.
*   Rapid7 coordinated with Rafay Baloch for the vulnerability disclosure.
*   The vulnerability disclosure was handled by Tod Beardsley of Rapid7.
*  The vendor was notified, with an expected fix date of Oct 19, 2020.
