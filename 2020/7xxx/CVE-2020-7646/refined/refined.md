{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `curlrequest` package allows arbitrary file reads due to unsanitized user input being passed to the 'file' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal (CWE-22)",
      "Arbitrary File Read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read any file on the system where the application is running, including application source code, configuration files, and other sensitive system files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By manipulating the 'file' parameter with directory traversal sequences (../) or absolute file paths, an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input passed to the `file` parameter of the `curlrequest` function.",
     "details": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the 'file' parameter in the `curlrequest` library. The library executes a system command using the 'cat' utility, and the path provided in the file parameter is passed directly, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file to be read."
