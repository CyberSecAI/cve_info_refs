  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-7716",
    "description": "The deeps package is vulnerable to prototype pollution. The `set` function allows an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects, by manipulating the `__proto__` attribute. This can lead to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection.",
    "root_cause": "The `set` function in the `deeps` library allows modification of the `__proto__` property, leading to prototype pollution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, remote code execution by tampering with application source code, or property injection by modifying security-related properties such as cookies or tokens.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `set` function of the `deeps` library with a path that includes `__proto__`, allowing the attacker to control the injected value and pollute the object prototype.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the `set` function with attacker-controlled path and values, typically within client-side Javascript or a server-side NodeJS application."
  },
    "affected_package": {
    "name": "deeps",
    "version": "all versions are vulnerable"
     },
  "remediation": {
    "recommended_fix": "There is no fixed version for `deeps`.",
    "prevention_methods": [
        "Freeze the prototype using `Object.freeze (Object.prototype)`.",
        "Require schema validation of JSON input.",
        "Avoid using unsafe recursive merge functions.",
        "Consider using objects without prototypes (e.g., `Object.create(null)`), which breaks the prototype chain.",
        "As a best practice, use `Map` instead of `Object`."
