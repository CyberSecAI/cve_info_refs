{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-7766",
    "Root cause": "The `set` operation in `json-ptr` does not properly check the key being set when the `force` flag is set to `true`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can manipulate the prototype of the base object, leading to denial of service, remote code execution, or property injection.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By controlling the path in the `set` operation, the attacker can inject properties into the prototype."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the `path` parameter in the `set` operation of the vulnerable package with the force flag set to `true`."
  }
}
