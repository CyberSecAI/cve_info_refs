Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue that allows for arbitrary file reads. This means that an attacker can manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended directory. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered via the patch history from the GitHub Commits API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the system where `snyk-broker` is running. This is a classic path traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** A successful exploit leads to the potential exposure of sensitive information stored on the server where the `snyk-broker` is running. This could include configuration files, environment variables, or other confidential data.
- **High Confidentiality Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high confidentiality impact, meaning the attacker could potentially access all resources within the affected component.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is accessible through the network. It is described as "remotely exploitable," meaning attackers can exploit it from network hops away.
- **GitHub Commits API:** The vulnerability is triggered via patch history from the GitHub Commits API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable `snyk-broker` instance.
- **High Privileges:** The attacker requires significant (e.g., administrative) privileges over the vulnerable component. This suggests that while the attack is network based, the attacker might need valid credentials or access to a relevant API within the Snyk infrastructure.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.79.0 of the `snyk-broker` package.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Wing Chan of The Hut Group via a bug bounty program.
- The fix also included steps to improve the auditability of the Broker code and improved logging.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
