Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of file paths within the `ExtractTo` function of the `github.com/unknwon/cae/zip` package. Specifically, the function fails to sanitize paths in zip archives that contain leading or non-leading ".." sequences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (Zip Slip):** The core issue is a path traversal vulnerability, where an attacker can craft a malicious zip archive with file names containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../file.txt`). When extracted, these paths allow the attacker to write files outside of the intended target directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system where the vulnerable application is running.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the attacker can overwrite configuration files or executables with malicious content, they could gain arbitrary code execution capabilities.
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Attackers can modify or corrupt existing files, leading to a loss of data integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted zip archive that includes filenames with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`, `..\\`, `..\\..\\`).
- This crafted archive is then processed by the vulnerable `ExtractTo` function in the `github.com/unknwon/cae/zip` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious zip file to the vulnerable application and trigger the extraction process using `cae_zip.ExtractTo()`.
- No special privileges are required for the attacker to exploit the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `github.com/unknwon/cae/zip` prior to 1.0.1.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) has been created and is provided by Snyk. This PoC demonstrates how a malicious zip file can be used to write files outside of the target extraction folder.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   CVSS v3.1 score is 7.5 (High)
*   Snyk assigned the ID `SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMUNKNWONCAEZIP-570383` to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed on May 26, 2020, and published on June 5, 2020.
