Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure default configurations in the UmbracoForms package. Specifically, the default settings for file upload forms do not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Defaults:** The primary weakness is the lack of restrictions on file types allowed during upload, leading to a potential for arbitrary file upload.
- **CWE-453 (Insecure Default Settings):** This CWE is explicitly linked to the vulnerability, highlighting the problem of using default configurations that are not secure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any file type, including malicious ones, through the vulnerable upload forms.
- **Potential for Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:** While the CVSS score indicates Low impact to Confidentiality and Integrity, the ability to upload arbitrary files could lead to various other attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if the application serves the uploaded files, or denial of service (DoS) attacks if malicious files can impact server performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerable component is accessible over the network, making it remotely exploitable.
- **File Upload Form:** The vulnerability is specifically exploited by submitting malicious files through a file upload form created using the UmbracoForms package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system or its configuration.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs a victim to interact with the file upload functionality of the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the network where the application is running to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `UmbracoForms` package up to the time of the disclosure (28 July 2020).
- There is no fixed version of the package. The developers advise users to implement custom workflows and front-end validations to block unwanted file types.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited.
