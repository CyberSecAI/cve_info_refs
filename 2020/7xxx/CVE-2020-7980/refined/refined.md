Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7980:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw within the Intellian Satellite controller (specifically, the Intellian Aptus Web interface). The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) script exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Intellian Aptus Web interface. This is a high-severity vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization or Command Injection:** The vulnerability suggests a lack of proper input sanitization or protection against command injection in the Intellian Aptus Web interface. It allows the attacker to inject and execute operating system commands directly.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control of the satellite controller system.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker can access and manipulate sensitive data on the controller.
*   **Disruption of Service:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the satellite system or use it for malicious activities.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The PoC indicates that the attacker gains root privileges on the server, meaning that they have full control over the operating system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending malicious requests to the Intellian Aptus Web interface.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerable component is within the Intellian Aptus Web interface. This means the attacker interacts through web requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the Intellian satellite controller.
*   **Target Identification:** The attacker needs to identify a target using the vulnerable Intellian Aptus Web interface.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Some technical skill is needed to utilize the exploit script, or to craft their own. The PoC script demonstrates the steps required.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes a link to a GitHub repository with a Python PoC script (`satellian.py`) that demonstrates the vulnerability.
*   The script attempts to list available system binaries and then provides a shell to interact with the server as root.
*   Tested versions include Intellian v1.12, v1.21, v1.24.
*   The repository explicitly states that the information is for educational purposes and that the author is not responsible for any misuse.

In summary, CVE-2020-7980 is a critical RCE vulnerability in Intellian satellite controllers that allows attackers with network access to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system.
