Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of CGF files in Schneider Electric IGSS. This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Specifically, reading past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector requires user interaction, meaning the target must either:
    - Visit a malicious web page
    - Open a malicious CGF file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to create a malicious CGF file or control a website that can trigger the vulnerable parsing code. They do not need any privileges on the target system.
