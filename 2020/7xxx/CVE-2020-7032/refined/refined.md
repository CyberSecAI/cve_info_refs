Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw within the Avaya Web License Manager (WebLM). This flaw allows an authenticated user to upload a malicious XML file containing a crafted DTD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the XML parsing process.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The WebLM fails to properly validate the uploaded XML, allowing the inclusion of malicious external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the web server user has access to. This includes sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`, SSH keys, and other configuration files.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By manipulating the DTD, the attacker can also conduct SSRF attacks by making the server initiate requests to other internal or external resources.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly detailed, the SEC Consult advisory mentions a "special payload" could affect the availability of the web application which could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is initiated over the network, targeting the WebLM application.
*   **Authenticated Access:** Exploitation requires an authenticated user with access to the WebLM admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the WebLM application. Default credentials of `admin:weblmadmin` may be used if the application has not been hardened.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the WebLM application.
*   **Crafted XML and DTD files:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious XML file and a corresponding DTD file to perform the XXE injection.
*   **Attacker Controlled Server:** The attacker requires a server to host the DTD and capture the exfiltrated data via webserver and ftp server.

**Summary of Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability is a *Blind Out-of-Band XXE* meaning the attacker does not receive feedback directly in the WebLM application.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when an authenticated user uploads a malicious XML file through the "Install License" functionality of Avaya WebLM.
*   The provided proof-of-concept uses a crafted XML file and DTD to read `/etc/shadow` file.
*   The exploit involves setting up a web server to serve the DTD file and an FTP server to receive the exfiltrated data.
*   Affected products include Avaya WebLM and Avaya Aura System Manager with vulnerable versions spanning 6.x, 7.0 through 7.1.3.6, and 8.0 through 8.1.2.0.0.
*   Patches have been released for versions 7.1.3.7 and 8.1.3.
*   There is no known workaround, upgrading is the only solution.
