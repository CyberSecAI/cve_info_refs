Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7695

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences within HTTP header values in the `uvicorn` server when using the `httptools` parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** The server fails to escape CRLF sequences in the value of HTTP headers, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary headers or even a complete response body. This is due to the `httptools` parser not sanitizing header values.
- **CWE-113:** Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting').

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious HTTP headers into the server's responses.
- **Arbitrary Response Body:** Attackers can potentially inject a completely different HTTP response body than intended by the server.
- **Cache Poisoning:** Injected headers or response bodies may be cached by intermediate servers, potentially leading to cache poisoning.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can control the injected content, they could inject malicious scripts leading to XSS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers inject CRLF characters (%0d%0a) into the URL path of HTTP requests. Specifically, when the server reflects the URL path in a header like `Referer`, an attacker can inject a crafted URL path to add arbitrary headers to the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `uvicorn` server. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or prior access to the system.
- **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `uvicorn` versions prior to 0.11.7.
- The fix involves upgrading `uvicorn` to version 0.11.7 or higher.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
The provided PoC demonstrates how to inject an additional header by crafting a URL path with CRLF sequences. This confirms the HTTP response splitting vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**
- Snyk: 5.3 (Medium)
- NVD: 5.3 (Medium)

**CVSS Vector:**
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
