Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Improper serialization of MongoDB Server's internal authorization state. Specifically, the RoleGraph component did not correctly serialize authentication restrictions (IP source address protection).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Improper Serialization:** The vulnerability lies in the incorrect way the authorization state, particularly IP source address restrictions, are serialized into BSON format. This leads to the restrictions not being enforced correctly after administrative actions or updates.
-  **Bypass of IP Source Address Protection:** Due to the incorrect serialization, a user with valid credentials could bypass the configured IP source address restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A user with valid credentials, who should have been restricted by IP source address protection mechanisms, is able to bypass these restrictions. This could lead to unauthorized access or actions from unexpected IP addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker would need to:
1. Possess valid user credentials to the MongoDB server.
2. Trigger administrative actions that cause the serialization of the role graph.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs valid user credentials to the affected MongoDB server.
- No specific network position is mentioned, meaning the attacker could be internal, external or on a different network, provided they have valid credentials to connect to the MongoDB server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MongoDB Server:
  - 4.2 versions prior to 4.2.3
  - 4.0 versions prior to 4.0.15
  - 4.3 versions prior to 4.3.3
  - 3.6 versions prior to 3.6.18
- The fix was included in these versions and later.
- The issue was discovered by Tony Yesudas.
- The issue is tracked by ticket SERVER-45472.
