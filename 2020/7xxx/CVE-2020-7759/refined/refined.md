Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ClassificationstoreController` within the pimcore/pimcore package. Specifically, the `relationIds` parameter was vulnerable to SQL injection due to not being properly quoted in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). By crafting malicious input within the `relationIds` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** A successful SQL injection can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality (CVSS: High), allowing an attacker to access sensitive data, including user names and passwords.
*   **Availability Loss:** Exploitation can cause a total loss of availability (CVSS: High), potentially leading to denial of service by disrupting the application or its database.
*   **Integrity Impact:** Although the integrity impact is rated as "None" in CVSS, SQL injection could still lead to data modification or deletion by a successful attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based (CVSS: Network). The vulnerability is exposed over the network and can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/admin/classificationstore/relations` endpoint. The malicious input is sent via the `relationIds` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privileges Required:**  The attacker requires high privileges (CVSS: High) within the application to exploit the vulnerability, meaning administrative level access.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction (CVSS: None) from a legitimate user, making it easier for an attacker.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint**: The attacker must know or discover the `/admin/classificationstore/relations` endpoint and how to format the `relationIds` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in pimcore/pimcore versions between 6.7.2 and before 6.8.3.
*   The fix was implemented in version 6.8.3 by properly quoting the `relationIds` parameter to prevent SQL injection.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is publicly available, increasing the threat level.
*   Snyk assigned the ID SNYK-PHP-PIMCOREPIMCORE-1017405 to this vulnerability.
