Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7982:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in the `checksum_hex2bin` function within the `opkg` package manager of OpenWrt. This function is responsible for converting hexadecimal checksum strings into binary form. The vulnerability exists because the code increments the `src` pointer to skip leading spaces before checksum processing, but uses the original `s` pointer without space trimming for the actual hex conversion loop. Therefore, if a checksum string starts with spaces, the loop exits early resulting in a zero length checksum.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Bypassed SHA256 Checksum Verification:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of the SHA256 checksum verification for downloaded packages. Due to the bug in `checksum_hex2bin`, the computed checksum is not stored. When `opkg` proceeds to install a package, the SHA256 check is skipped entirely.
*   **Unencrypted HTTP Download:** The `opkg` utility downloads package lists and packages over unencrypted HTTP connections. This lack of encryption allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, making it possible to inject malicious packages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious `.ipk` packages into a vulnerable OpenWrt system. Since `opkg` runs as root, the attacker gains full control of the device.
*  **Arbitrary code injection**: Malicious packages with attacker controlled payload can be installed and executed.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positioned as a MITM can intercept traffic between the OpenWrt device and `downloads.openwrt.org`. The attacker can then replace legitimate package lists and packages with malicious ones.
*   **DNS Poisoning:** By poisoning the DNS server that the OpenWrt device uses, an attacker can redirect `downloads.openwrt.org` to a server they control, where they can serve malicious updates.
*   **ARP cache poisoning / Packet spoofing:** The attacker may be able to perform attacks on the local network by using packet spoofing or ARP cache poisoning (speculation).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept or redirect network traffic from the OpenWrt device to the official OpenWrt package server or control the DNS server used by the device.
*   The attacker must be able to serve forged package lists and malicious packages with the same size as the legitimate ones.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present for approximately three years, introduced in February 2017.
*   A partial fix was initially implemented by removing the space in the `SHA256sum` field of the package list. However, this was insufficient as attackers could still use older, signed lists.
*   The actual fix was implemented in the `checksum_hex2bin` function and released in OpenWrt versions 18.06.7 and 19.07.1
*   Exploitation requires the malicious `.ipk` package to have the exact same size as the legitimate one. This can be done by padding the malicious package with null bytes to match the expected size.
* The vulnerability is similar to past vulnerabilities in Debian's `apt` package manager
