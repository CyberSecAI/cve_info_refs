Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
A bug in the query planner allows specific queries to violate an invariant in the server selection subsystem, leading to an unhandled exception. The issue is located in the `index_bounds_builder.cpp` file within the MongoDB codebase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755): The server fails to gracefully handle the exception triggered by the specially crafted query, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause the MongoDB server to become unresponsive, disrupting service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted query to the MongoDB server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have database query privileges to execute the malicious query.

**Affected Versions:**
- MongoDB Server version 4.4 prior to 4.4.1.
- Versions before 4.4 are not affected.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, with the vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. This indicates a network-based attack, low attack complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction, and high impact on availability.
- The issue was fixed in version 4.4.1
