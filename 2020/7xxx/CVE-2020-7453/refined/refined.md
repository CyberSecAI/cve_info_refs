Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing NUL-termination check in the `jail_set(2)` system call when handling the "osrelease" configuration option. Specifically, the kernel does not ensure that the `osrelease` string is properly null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing NUL-termination:** The core weakness is the lack of a NUL terminator check when setting the "osrelease" option through `jail_set(2)`. This allows for potentially setting an unterminated string.
*   **Information Disclosure:** When reading back the jail configuration using `jail_get(2)`, the system may read beyond the intended buffer because the string is not null-terminated leading to an information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** A superuser within a jail (with `children.max > 0` or nested jails) can create a new jail. When retrieving the configuration of this newly created jail using `jail_get(2)`, the missing NUL-termination can lead to the disclosure of adjacent kernel memory. This could expose sensitive information from kernel space.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, requiring a superuser inside a jail environment with nested jail support ( `children.max > 0` ) enabled.
*   **System Call Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `jail_set(2)` and `jail_get(2)` system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Superuser in a Jail:** The attacker must have superuser privileges inside a jail.
*  **Nested Jails Enabled:** The jail must have nested jail support enabled (children.max > 0)

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability allows a local attacker (superuser within a jail) to read kernel memory by exploiting a missing null-termination check when setting the "osrelease" jail configuration option. This is achieved through `jail_set` and then reading back this value using `jail_get`, potentially exposing sensitive kernel data.
