Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue in the `templ8` npm package. It arises from the `parse` function, which allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the ability to modify the `__proto__` property of JavaScript objects via the `parse` function, allowing the attacker to inject properties into the prototype chain. This allows an attacker to overwrite or pollute a JavaScript application's base object.
*   **Unsafe Property Handling:** The `parse` function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing the injection of properties like `__proto__`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting crucial prototype properties (e.g., `toString`), the attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In specific cases where the codebase uses `eval` or similar functions on object properties, an attacker can inject malicious code through prototype pollution, leading to RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject properties that the application depends on for security or functionality, such as admin flags or tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a crafted template string containing `__proto__` property to the vulnerable `parse` function.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `parse` function of the templ8 library.
*   No special privileges or user interaction are required. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Technical Details:**

*   The proof-of-concept (POC) provided demonstrates that by injecting `{{__proto__.polluted=true}}` into the template string and parsing with `tpl.parse()`, the `polluted` property becomes available on the global object.
*   The vulnerability is related to the way JavaScript handles object prototypes and allows modification of the `__proto__` property.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by using specially crafted strings to inject malicious properties or modify existing object prototype properties.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of `templ8` since no fix is available.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content provides a detailed explanation of Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities including unsafe object merge, property definition by path, and various types of attacks possible.
*   It also includes ways to prevent prototype pollution.
*   Snyk has a proof-of-concept for this vulnerability and it is considered to have a high severity score of 7.5.
*   NVD has rated this as a critical vulnerability with a score of 9.8.
*   The EPSS score indicates a 1.22% probability of exploitation in the wild.
