Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper resource management when using the "password" feature in TriStation 1131 software. Specifically, it relates to how the software handles connections and key-switch protection. If the user does not adhere to documented guidelines, an attacker can exploit this weakness to cause a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The core weakness is the lack of proper resource control. The TriStation 1131 software does not effectively manage resources when the password feature is used incorrectly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service attack. The system can become unavailable or unresponsive, disrupting operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit it remotely.
*   **Exploiting Misconfiguration:** The vulnerability is triggered if the user does not follow documented guidelines related to TriStation 1131 connections and key-switch protection. This implies the attacker needs to understand or discover improper configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes a low skill level is required to exploit this.
*   **Knowledge of Misconfiguration:** While low skill level, the attacker must have knowledge or discover a misconfigured system where the software is not used as intended, specifically regarding dedicated connections and key-switch protection.

**Summary of CVE-2020-7484:**

This CVE describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in the TriStation 1131 software related to improper use of the password feature. By exploiting the lack of resource control, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition when the user does not follow documented guidelines regarding dedicated connections and key switch protection. The attacker can do this remotely with a low skill level.
