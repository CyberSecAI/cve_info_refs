Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7717:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `create` function in the `dot-notes` package, which is susceptible to prototype pollution. This function allows an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `create` function allows modification of the `__proto__` attribute of objects.
- The package is vulnerable to prototype pollution via property definition by path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, attackers can cause JavaScript exceptions, leading to a denial of service. For example, polluting `toString` with an integer would break code relying on `someobject.toString()`.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the codebase evaluates an object's attribute and executes it (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker can inject malicious code through prototype pollution, leading to RCE.
- **Property Injection:** Attackers can inject or modify properties that the application relies on, including security-sensitive properties like cookies or tokens (e.g., polluting `Object.prototype.isAdmin` to gain admin privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**
- By exploiting the `create` function of the `dot-notes` package and providing a malicious path such as `__proto__.polluted` an attacker can modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `create` function of the `dot-notes` library.
- No user interaction is needed.
- Network access is required as it's a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a prototype pollution issue, specifically through property definition by path.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype using `dots.create({}, '__proto__.polluted', true);`
- The vulnerability can lead to various attacks, including denial of service, remote code execution, and property injection.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `dot-notes` prior to 3.2.1.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)
