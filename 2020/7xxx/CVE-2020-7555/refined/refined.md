Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of CGF files within Schneider Electric IGSS. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to write data past the end of an allocated data structure. This is a classic buffer overflow style vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running IGSS. This implies a complete compromise of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The attacker can craft a malicious CGF file.
- **Malicious Page:** The attacker can host the malicious CGF file on a malicious web page, likely requiring the target to visit the page.
- **User interaction required:** The target user needs to either open the malicious CGF file or visit the malicious web page for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver or convince the victim to interact with a malicious CGF file.
- The attacker doesn't need a privileged position on the target system, they can be considered remote.
- The attack vector involves user interaction which makes it a non-trivial exploitation scenario

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-7555.
- Schneider Electric has released a patch/update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by kimiya to the vendor.
