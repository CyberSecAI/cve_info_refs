Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when performing PUT operations on content, specifically when using `plone.app.contenttypes`. This means a user might be able to overwrite content without having the necessary write permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is a flaw in the access control mechanism, allowing unauthorized write operations on content. This results in a privilege escalation vulnerability, where a user can potentially modify content they should not be able to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Content Modification:** An attacker could overwrite or modify content without proper authorization, potentially leading to data corruption, defacement of the website, or other forms of unauthorized changes to the Plone site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PUT Requests:** The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerability through PUT requests, specifically when `plone.app.contenttypes` is in use.
*   **Direct Interaction with Content:** The attacker needs to be able to interact directly with the content management system to send these PUT requests, however,  specific requirements are not outlined.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  While not explicitly stated, it is implied that the attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user to make the necessary PUT requests to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content mentions that this vulnerability "seems hard to do in practice".
*   The fix is only needed when `plone.app.contenttypes` is used.
*   This vulnerability was reported and fixed by Alessandro Pisa.
