Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `options` argument passed to the `exports` function in the `index.js` file of the `gulp-styledocco` package. This allows user-controlled input to be directly used in command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because the `options` argument isn't sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the underlying shell execution. This is accomplished by including shell metacharacters such as `"` and `&` within the `options` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server running `gulp-styledocco`.
- **Full Confidentiality Loss:** The attacker gains access to all resources.
- **Integrity Compromise:** The attacker can modify data, although not with a high level of control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `options` argument of the `exports` function within the `index.js` file.
- An attacker can craft a malicious `options` object containing shell commands when calling the `gulp-styledocco` plugin within a `gulpfile.js`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `options` object that is passed to the `gulp-styledocco` plugin. This could be achieved through various means such as compromising a project's `gulpfile.js` or by supplying a malicious config to a user of the package.
- No user interaction is required.
- The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `gulp-styledocco` package.
- Snyk has a proof-of-concept for the vulnerability
- The Snyk analysis assigns a severity of medium (6.5), while NVD assigns a critical severity of 9.8.
- The exploit maturity is confirmed and there's a proof of concept.
