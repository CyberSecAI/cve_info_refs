Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-7955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of Access Control List (ACL) enforcement on the `/v1/agent/health/service/*` endpoints within the HashiCorp Consul HTTP API. This means that even with ACLs enabled and a default "deny" policy in place, these endpoints would still leak service and check information to unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing ACL Enforcement:** The primary weakness is the absence of ACL checks on specific API endpoints. This allows access to sensitive information without proper authorization.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable endpoints leak service and check information, potentially exposing details such as service names, IDs, health status, ports, metadata, node names, check names, notes, and check outputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker, even without valid ACL tokens, could obtain sensitive service and check information by querying the vulnerable endpoints. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, reconnaissance, or further malicious activities.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exposed service details can aid an attacker in planning more complex attacks by revealing the application's infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerable endpoints are part of the HTTP API, making them accessible over the network, typically on localhost, but configurable by users. This means a local user on the host running consul can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Consul HTTP API, which is often exposed on localhost but can be configured otherwise.
- **No Authentication Required:** An attacker does not need to authenticate or have a valid ACL token to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Local Machine Access:** The attacker would need local access if the HTTP API is served via localhost, which is the default behavior.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Consul versions 1.4.1 through 1.6.2.
- It is considered a low-risk vulnerability because the HTTP API is often served via localhost, limiting its exposure. However, this is configurable.
- The fix for the vulnerability is included in Consul version 1.6.3 and later by enforcing ACLs on the mentioned endpoints.
- Even after the fix, looking up a service by ID might still "leak" the fact that a service with the ID exists, but this is deemed unavoidable due to the way ACLs are intended to check service names.
