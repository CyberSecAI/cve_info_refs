## Description

![@hanshasselberg](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38218?u=3d1d7451403f256eabc9a6f52cfad2abeb9c886b&v=4&size=48)[hanshasselberg](https://github.com/hanshasselberg)opened [on Jan 28, 2020](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/7160#issue-556558587)

**Vulnerability ID:** [CVE-2020-7955](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9w6-rhh9-7v53 "CVE-2020-7955")

**Release Date:** January 29, 2020

**Affected Products/Versions:** Previous versions of Consul and Consul Enterprise; fixed in 1.6.3.

A low risk vulnerability was identified in Consul and Consul Enterprise (“Consul”) HTTP API such that the endpoints `v1/agent/health/service/*` did not enforce acl. This vulnerability affects Consul releases 1.4.1 until 1.6.2, and is fixed in 1.6.3

This adds acl enforcement to the two endpoints that were missing it.

Note that in the case of getting a services health by its id, we still must first lookup the service so we still "leak" information about a service with that ID existing. There isn't really a way around it though as ACLs are meant to check service names.

## Vulnerability Details

Even with an agent with ACLs enabled and with a default “deny” policy, these endpoints still leak some service and check information. The data leaked looks like:

```
[
    {
        "AggregatedStatus": "passing",
        "Service": {
            "ID": "web",
            "Service": "web",
            "Tags": [],
            "Meta": {},
            "Port": 1234,
            "Address": "",
            "Weights": {
                "Passing": 1,
                "Warning": 1
            },
            "EnableTagOverride": false,
            "Namespace": "default"
        },
        "Checks": []
    }
]
```

So in here, we have service names and ids, overall health, ports, any metadata and a list of checks. That list of checks will contain the node name, check name, notes and check output to mention a few things.

The only thing that makes this less bad is that the HTTP API is normally served via localhost (although a user can override that). In that case you would have to be on the machine already in order to figure out the service and check info (which would also be found in the data dir of Consul)

## Remediation

Customers should upgrade to Consul or Consul Enterprise 1.6.3, or newer. Please refer to Upgrading Consul for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@hanshasselberg](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38218?u=3d1d7451403f256eabc9a6f52cfad2abeb9c886b&v=4&size=48)[hanshasselberg](https://github.com/hanshasselberg)opened [on Jan 28, 2020](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/7160#issue-556558587)

**Vulnerability ID:** [CVE-2020-7955](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r9w6-rhh9-7v53 "CVE-2020-7955")

**Release Date:** January 29, 2020

**Affected Products/Versions:** Previous versions of Consul and Consul Enterprise; fixed in 1.6.3.

A low risk vulnerability was identified in Consul and Consul Enterprise (“Consul”) HTTP API such that the endpoints `v1/agent/health/service/*` did not enforce acl. This vulnerability affects Consul releases 1.4.1 until 1.6.2, and is fixed in 1.6.3

This adds acl enforcement to the two endpoints that were missing it.

Note that in the case of getting a services health by its id, we still must first lookup the service so we still "leak" information about a service with that ID existing. There isn't really a way around it though as ACLs are meant to check service names.

## Vulnerability Details

Even with an agent with ACLs enabled and with a default “deny” policy, these endpoints still leak some service and check information. The data leaked looks like:

```
[
    {
        "AggregatedStatus": "passing",
        "Service": {
            "ID": "web",
            "Service": "web",
            "Tags": [],
            "Meta": {},
            "Port": 1234,
            "Address": "",
            "Weights": {
                "Passing": 1,
                "Warning": 1
            },
            "EnableTagOverride": false,
            "Namespace": "default"
        },
        "Checks": []
    }
]
```

So in here, we have service names and ids, overall health, ports, any metadata and a list of checks. That list of checks will contain the node name, check name, notes and check output to mention a few things.

The only thing that makes this less bad is that the HTTP API is normally served via localhost (although a user can override that). In that case you would have to be on the machine already in order to figure out the service and check info (which would also be found in the data dir of Consul)

## Remediation

Customers should upgrade to Consul or Consul Enterprise 1.6.3, or newer. Please refer to Upgrading Consul for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.
