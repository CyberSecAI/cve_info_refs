Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw located in the `lib/index.js` file of the `node-ps` package. Specifically, the injection point is at line 72 of the mentioned file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs a command using unsanitized input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially access and steal any data on the affected system.
*   **Complete Loss of Integrity:** An attacker could modify or delete any files on the system, potentially leading to data corruption or system compromise.
*   **Complete Loss of Availability:** An attacker can render the system unusable by denying access to resources or causing a system crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is network-bound, meaning it can be exploited by attackers beyond the local network, including the entire Internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any prior access or privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **No User Interaction:** The exploit does not require any user interaction to be successful.

**Technical Details:**

* The `node-ps` package allows for the execution of commands through user-provided arguments.
* A proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a malicious command using the `psargs` parameter within the `lookup` function of the package, where `psargs` is not sanitized.
* Specifically, the PoC uses `a.lookup({psargs:["& touch JHU #"]},function(){})` to inject a `touch` command to create a file named "JHU".

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a critical CVSS score of 9.8.
* There is no fix available for this vulnerability.
* The exploit is mature and well-understood, as indicated by the Snyk data, so it can be easily used to attack systems that are using the vulnerable version of the `node-ps` package.
