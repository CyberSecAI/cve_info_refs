Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7742:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `simpl-schema` package's use of an unsafe recursive merge function. This function is used in `SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages`.
- The recursive merge function doesn't properly handle the `__proto__` property during merging operations. Specifically, when the source object contains a property named `__proto__`, and the merge function recursively merges objects, it can modify the `Object.prototype` by assigning values to the prototype.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Prototype Pollution:**  The core weakness is Prototype Pollution. An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` by exploiting the unsafe recursive merge function. This is done by crafting a JSON object with a `__proto__` key containing the desired properties.
- **Unsafe Recursive Merge:** The vulnerability is a result of the unsafe recursive merge implementation, which doesn't sanitize or block the `__proto__` property when merging objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting `Object.prototype` with unexpected values, like integers, or manipulating crucial properties such as `toString`, the application can crash or become unstable, leading to a denial of service.
- **Remote Code Execution:** In certain scenarios, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution if the application evaluates polluted object attributes using functions like `eval()`.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker can pollute properties that the codebase relies on, such as security-related ones like `isAdmin`, potentially leading to privilege escalation or bypassing authentication/authorization.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages` function. The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JSON object containing the `__proto__` key.
- The vulnerable function takes the attacker-controlled JSON object as input.
- An attacker could inject this malicious object, leading to prototype pollution

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages` function.
- No special privileges are needed for the attack.
- The attack can be performed remotely, potentially via a network.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content explains the general concept of Prototype Pollution, including the different attack types (DoS, RCE, Property Injection).
- It details how unsafe object merges and property definition by path can cause prototype pollution.
- The content also provides a proof of concept code snippet to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```javascript
const SimpleSchema = require("simpl-schema").default;
let obj = {};
console.log("Before : " + obj.polluted);
SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages(JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":"yes"}}'));
console.log("After : " + obj.polluted);
```
- Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) to this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-7742 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `simpl-schema` package caused by an unsafe recursive merge. It can lead to DoS, RCE, or property injection. An attacker can exploit it by providing a malicious JSON object with the `__proto__` key via the `SimpleSchema.setDefaultMessages` function.
