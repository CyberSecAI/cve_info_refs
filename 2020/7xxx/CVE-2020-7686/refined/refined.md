Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a Directory Traversal issue caused by a lack of path sanitization in the `readFile` operation within the `readFileFromContentBase` function of the `rollup-plugin-dev-server` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided paths, allowing attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended webroot. Specifically, the plugin does not prevent the use of "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences or absolute file paths when serving files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, including source code, configuration files, and other sensitive information. This is demonstrated with an example of leaking a private SSH key.
- Potentially **Arbitrary file read** by accessing and reading files outside of the intended directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** By crafting a malicious URL with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can request files located outside of the intended directory.
- The `curl` command is used to demonstrate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable `rollup-plugin-dev-server`.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of the server file structure** may be helpful for an effective exploit but not required for initial attempts.

**Additional Details:**
- The content references `st` module vulnerability and zip-slip vulnerability to explain more about directory traversal.
- There is a proof of concept (PoC) provided that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability, including creating a server, a sensitive file, and using `curl` to access it using path traversal.
- The Snyk report includes CVSS v3.1 scores for the vulnerability:
    -  **Attack Vector (AV): Network**
    -  **Attack Complexity (AC): Low**
    -  **Privileges Required (PR): None**
    -  **User Interaction (UI): None**
    -  **Scope (S): Unchanged**
    -  **Confidentiality (C): High**
    -  **Integrity (I): None**
    -  **Availability (A): None**
- The Snyk report also indicates that there is no fixed version available for the vulnerable package, `rollup-plugin-dev-server`.
