Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of CGF files in Schneider Electric IGSS. This lack of validation allows an attacker to craft malicious CGF files that cause a write operation beyond the bounds of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, where a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process of the IGSS application. This can allow the attacker to fully compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious CGF Files:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious CGF file that triggers the vulnerability during parsing by the IGSS software.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs the victim to either open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that will trigger the opening of the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to deliver malicious files or trick a victim into opening it:** The attacker needs to have the ability to deliver a malicious CGF file to the victim, or trick a victim into opening a malicious file from a malicious website.
*   **No special access rights needed:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed file format, no special access rights are needed.

**Additional Information:**
*   Schneider Electric has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-08-05.
*   The advisory was publicly released on 2021-01-29.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by "kimiya".
