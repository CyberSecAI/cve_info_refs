Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper validation of TLS certificates used for mTLS (mutual TLS) RPC (Remote Procedure Call) in HashiCorp Nomad. Specifically, Nomad did not correctly check the certificate's name for the role and region.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The core issue is that while Nomad validated the certificate's expiration and CA signature, it failed to verify the certificate's name (Common Name or Subject Alternative Name - SAN) to match the expected role (client or server) and region.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using a client certificate signed by the same CA as the Nomad nodes but lacking the required name format, an attacker could bypass access control and send RPC calls as either a Nomad client or server node.
*   **Access to Secrets:** This privilege escalation could allow the attacker to access any secrets or other resources accessible to a legitimate client or server node.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **mTLS RPC:** The vulnerability is specific to mTLS-enabled RPC communication within Nomad.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** An attacker needs to obtain or create a certificate signed by the same CA that is trusted by the Nomad cluster. This certificate, however, does not have to conform to the expected naming scheme for the roles and regions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Trusted Operator:** The attacker must be a trusted operator who can obtain a client certificate signed by the cluster's CA.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to communicate with the Nomad cluster's RPC endpoints.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of Nomad and Nomad Enterprise prior to 0.10.3.
*   The fix involves adding validation of the certificate name (CN or SAN) to ensure it matches the expected `client.<region>.nomad` or `server.<region>.nomad` format based on the node type.
*   Nomad clusters configured for mTLS following the "Securing Nomad with TLS" guide or the "Vault PKI Secrets Engine Integration" guide should already have certificates that will pass validation after the fix.
*   Operators using mTLS with `verify_server_hostname = true` are advised to confirm that their certificate names adhere to the correct format before upgrading to 0.10.3.
*  The vulnerability is referenced in issue #7003 and fixed by pull request #7023.
