{
  "CVE-2020-7734": {
    "description": "All versions up to 0.11.16 of package cabot are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Endpoint column.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Endpoint column of the HTTP check configuration, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, access to sensitive information, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the 'Endpoint' field of a cabot check configuration. When a user views the check results, the stored XSS is triggered",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires low privileges in the application to create or edit check configurations",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists because Django's autoescape feature was turned off for the test result error using `{% autoescape off %}`. The fix involves using the built-in Django autoescape and URLValidator. The vulnerability can be triggered when viewing the check results in both the Test name and Endpoint columns, which means the XSS is stored. Exploitation requires a user (admin) to view the check result after a malicious user has configured a check"
