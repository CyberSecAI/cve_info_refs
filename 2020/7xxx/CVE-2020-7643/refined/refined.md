Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7643:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to prototype pollution in the `paypal-adaptive` npm package. The `PayPal` function could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of `Object.prototype` by using a `__proto__` payload in the configuration object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to modify the prototype of the `Object` class through user-controlled input, specifically within the constructor of the `PayPal` class.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While the primary vulnerability is prototype pollution, the provided details point to a potential for DoS. By modifying the prototype, an attacker can cause unexpected behavior, possibly leading to application crashes, infinite loops, or other performance issues.
- **Code Injection:** Modifying the prototype could potentially allow for code injection or manipulation of application logic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious configuration object to the `PayPal` constructor, specifically including a `__proto__` property.
- The attack vector is a remote attack with low privileges and no user interaction.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the configuration object passed to the `PayPal` constructor. This could occur in various scenarios, such as when user input is used to configure the SDK or when the configuration is read from an untrusted source.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system where the code runs; having the ability to influence the code's initialization is enough.

**Additional details:**
- The Snyk analysis provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability: `var p = new PayPal({"__proto__": {"toString": "JHU"}, "userId": "foo", "password": "bar", "signature": "abcd", "appId": "1234", "sandbox": "1234"})`
- The vulnerable code lies within the `paypal-adaptive.js` file, specifically where the merge function does not prevent the user from setting the `__proto__` property.
