The provided content contains information about multiple address bar spoofing vulnerabilities in mobile browsers, including CVE-2020-7364, which is one of the vulnerabilities discussed.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerabilities stem from the way mobile browsers handle page loads and address bar updates, specifically through manipulation of Javascript timing. By carefully controlling the timing of page loads and address bar refreshes, an attacker can display a spoofed URL in the address bar while loading content from a different origin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** The core vulnerability is the ability to manipulate the browser's address bar to display a false URL, leading users to believe they are on a legitimate site when they are not.
*   **Timing Issues:** The exploitation relies on precise timing manipulations using Javascript's `setInterval` and `window.open` functions to trigger the spoof.
*   **Lack of Reliable Security Indicators:** Mobile browsers often lack robust security indicators, making the address bar the primary (and sometimes only) visual cue for users to verify a website's authenticity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to create convincing phishing pages that mimic legitimate websites (e.g., banks, payment processors).
*   **Credential Theft:** Users may unknowingly enter their credentials or sensitive information on a spoofed website, leading to account compromise.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could potentially distribute malware through the spoofed website, believing they are on a trusted platform.
*   **Bypassing Anti-Phishing Schemes:** The vulnerability can bypass many anti-phishing schemes because the address bar appears legitimate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The victim must visit a website controlled by the attacker, where the malicious Javascript is executed. This could be delivered via a phishing email, text message, or compromised link on a forum.
*   **Javascript Manipulation:** Attackers use Javascript code to manipulate the timing of page loads and address bar updates.
*   **Arbitrary Ports and Data Scheme:** Vulnerabilities were found by using arbitrary ports and `data://` scheme.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Javascript:** The attacker needs the ability to inject and execute malicious Javascript on a webpage visited by the victim.
*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** Attackers must use social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing emails, text messages) to lure victims to their malicious website.
*   **No special privileges are needed**. The attacker exploits a weakness in how the browser handles javascript and timing of page loads.
