Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ini-parser` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its parsing logic. It can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload within the .ini file it parses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Prototype Pollution:** The library does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` using a `__proto__` payload. This can be achieved through specially crafted .ini files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying crucial methods like `toString` or `valueOf` on `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause application crashes or unexpected behavior leading to DoS.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the codebase evaluates an object's properties and executes them (e.g., using `eval`), manipulating `Object.prototype` could lead to RCE.
*   **Property Injection:** By polluting properties that the codebase relies on (e.g., `isAdmin` flag), an attacker can manipulate application logic and potentially gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the parsing of a malicious .ini file. An attacker provides a string input or file that includes a `__proto__` property with attacker-controlled values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the malicious input to the `ini-parser` library, either through directly calling the parse function or through some mechanism that the target application uses the ini-parser library to parse an ini file.
*  No special privileges are needed to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**
*   The Snyk report mentions that the vulnerability has a proof of concept and gives the following PoC:
```
var a = require("ini-parser");
a.parse('[__proto__]\ntoString=JHU');
console.log({}.toString);
```
*   The vulnerability is present because the library uses a vulnerable parsing logic for handling the input, which does not validate the property names, allowing it to modify the prototype.
*   The snyk report also mentions ways to prevent prototype pollution, such as freezing the prototype, schema validation, avoiding unsafe merges and using objects without prototypes.
