- **Root cause of vulnerability:** External system configurations, specifically for third-party integrations like DVR systems, were being logged in the Command Centre event trail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information, including plain text usernames and passwords for the integrated DVR systems, was being logged in the event trail. This information was accessible to any authenticated user with the 'view events' privilege.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to the DVR system using the exposed credentials, potentially allowing them to view video feeds, manipulate recordings or conduct further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with valid Command Centre credentials and the ‘view events’ privilege could access the sensitive information by viewing the event trail logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires a valid account on the Gallagher Command Centre system with the "view events" privilege.
