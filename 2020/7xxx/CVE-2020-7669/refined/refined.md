Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7669

**Description:**
The vulnerability is an Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction, also known as a "Zip Slip" vulnerability, affecting the `github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/tarutil` package before version 0.9.0.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of file paths during archive extraction, specifically with tar files. The `filepath.Join` function was used insecurely when joining the base path and the file path from the archive, which allowed specially crafted archive file paths with "../" sequences to write outside of the intended extraction directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. By including ".." sequences in file paths within a tar archive, an attacker can cause extracted files to be written to locations outside the designated target directory.
- **Insecure `filepath.Join` Usage:** The use of `filepath.Join(base, file)` directly allows path traversal. The fix used `filepath.Join(base, filepath.Join("/", file))` which "swallows up" `..` to prevent traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
- **Potential Code Execution:** If an attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files, they could achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system.
- **Data Corruption/Modification:** The vulnerability could be used to modify or overwrite important files, leading to data corruption or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Tar Archive:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted tar archive containing malicious file paths with "../" sequences.
- **Extraction Process:** The vulnerability is triggered during the extraction process when the application uses the vulnerable `tarutil` package to extract the contents of the archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted tar archive to be extracted by the vulnerable application.
- No specific privileges are required as the vulnerability is exploitable during the extraction process.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects both leading and non-leading relative path traversal in tar file extraction.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is available. The provided PoC demonstrates how to use a crafted archive with `../` sequences in the file paths to write outside of the target directory.
- The fix was implemented by prepending `/` to the file path before joining with base.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `c995e6bd559a7b1bf642e4d418a75660f41920a9`.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.0 and higher of `github.com/u-root/u-root/pkg/tarutil`.
