Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the `effect` npm package. The package's image processing functionality utilizes user-provided input (`options`) without proper sanitization, directly incorporating it into shell commands executed via `child_process.exec`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is that the application constructs shell commands using unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the execution context. Specifically the `options.image` parameter is used in command generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to the execution of arbitrary shell commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This could enable an attacker to perform a wide range of malicious actions such as:
    - File system manipulation (reading, writing, deleting files)
    - Data exfiltration
    - System compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing malicious input through the `options.image` property.  
- Specifically the `options.image` property is concatenated into a string that is then executed by `child_process.exec`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `options` parameter, which is passed to the `applyEffect` function. This parameter contains an `image` property, and it is used to create shell command.
- This implies that the attacker must have a mechanism to influence the parameters passed to the vulnerable function, like an API or web interface that accepts user input.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

- **Vulnerable Code Location:** The vulnerable code is located in `helper.js`, specifically in the `generateCmd` function.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates the vulnerability by setting `options.image` to `& touch Song`, leading to the execution of `touch Song` command when the effect function is called.
- **Fix:** A fix was pushed into the master branch of the repository, but was not published as a new version of the package at the time.
- **Resolution:** The vulnerability was ultimately deemed not to be a vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-7624 describes a command injection vulnerability in the `effect` npm package where user-controlled input is unsafely used to create shell commands, enabling remote code execution. However, this has been revoked and deemed not to be a vulnerability.
