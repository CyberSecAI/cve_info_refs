{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a regular expression in the CodeMirror JavaScript library used for syntax highlighting in javascript mode. Specifically, the sub-pattern `(\\s|/\\*.*?\\*/)*` within the regex is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)",
      "Catastrophic backtracking due to inefficient regex pattern"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft malicious input strings that cause the vulnerable regular expression to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition, making the system unresponsive to legitimate users.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input strings to the CodeMirror editor that trigger the vulnerable regular expression.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the CodeMirror editor, such as via a web form or any other method where they can control the content being processed by CodeMirror. No authentication or special privileges are required."
