Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7700

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `parse_str` function within the `phpjs` package. This function is susceptible to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The `parse_str` function allows modification of the prototype of objects, leading to potential manipulation of inherited properties.
- Improper Input Handling: The function does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing the injection of malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Availability Loss: The vulnerability can lead to a total loss of availability, potentially resulting in denial of service.
- Code Execution: Modification of prototypes can lead to the execution of unintended code.
- Data Manipulation: By altering object properties, an attacker could potentially change the behavior of the application or manipulate data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via network access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No Privileges Required: The attacker does not need any prior access or authentication.
- No User Interaction: Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**
- The `parse_str` function in `phpjs` can be exploited by providing a crafted input string containing `__proto__`.
- This allows an attacker to add or overwrite properties in the prototype of objects, causing unintended consequences.

**Example Exploit (POC):**

```javascript
require('phpjs').parse_str("__proto__[polluted]=true",{});
console.log(polluted) //true
```

**CVSS Score:**
- Snyk: 7.5 (High)
- NVD: 9.8 (Critical)
