## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Do `msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -x <path_to_apkfile>` and ensure it works (or is at least no more wonky than APK file templating currently is)
* Review the diff for typos or improper parameterisation - ensure it's functionally equivalent to the old code

Sorry, something went wrong.
