- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation when opening specially crafted input files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121): Multiple stack-based buffer overflows can be triggered when a user opens a malicious input file.
    - Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125): An out-of-bounds read can occur due to the lack of input validation when a user opens a malicious file.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow: Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure, remote code execution, or application crash.
    - Out-of-bounds read: Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure, and possibly denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves a local user opening a specially crafted, malicious input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious file that when opened by a user with the vulnerable software, triggers the overflow.  The attacker requires the ability to get the file to a user of the vulnerable software.
