Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Calculated Fields Form plugin for WordPress has multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the plugin's input forms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerabilities are present in input fields such as 'field name' and 'form name' within the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database. When a user accesses the affected parts of the WordPress site (either backend or frontend), the malicious script will execute in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Data theft
    - Privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'field name' or 'form name' input fields while creating or editing forms.
- The injected script gets stored in the WordPress database.
- The XSS payload is triggered when users, including administrators, view the form on the website's backend or frontend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an authenticated account with the ability to edit or create forms within the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
