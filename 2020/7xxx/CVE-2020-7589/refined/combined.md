SUMMARY

A missing authentication vulnerability has been identiﬁed in SIEMENS LOGO!8 BM devices. The
vulnerability could lead to an attacker reading and modifying the device conﬁguration and obtain project
ﬁles from the devices if the attacker has access to port 135/tcp.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants):
All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth concept, including protection concept outlined in the system manual.

• Starting with version V8.3 of LOGO! 8 BM, port 135/tcp can be disabled. It is recommended to

disable the port when possible.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-7589

The vulnerability could lead to an attacker reading and modifying the device conﬁguration and obtain
project ﬁles from affected devices.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
port 135/tcp. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. The vulnerability
impacts conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Siemens recommends following their general security recommendations. As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to the [Siemens operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf) and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

For additional information, please refer to Siemens Security Advisory [SSA-817401](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-817401.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
