- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a missing bounds check on the `bufPos` variable when parsing `MMS_BIT_STRING` data in the `MmsValue_decodeMmsData` function. This allows an attacker to provide a large value for `bufPos`, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access when copying data from the input buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A heap buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. In this case, it causes a crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the out-of-bounds write.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious MMS message containing a `MMS_BIT_STRING` with a large `bufPos` value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send malicious MMS messages to a vulnerable system that uses the `libiec61850` library.
