Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-7042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `tunnel.c` file of openfortivpn version 1.11.0. When used with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, the certificate validation process mishandles the hostname check. This happens because the `X509_check_host` function operates on uninitialized memory, specifically the `common_name` buffer, leading to incorrect validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Memory Usage:** The primary weakness is the use of an uninitialized `common_name` buffer when calling the `X509_check_host` function.
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** Due to the use of uninitialized memory, the hostname verification fails.
- **Incorrect Hostname Check:** The hostname check operates on garbage data, preventing the correct acceptance of a valid certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassed Certificate Validation:** The main impact is that a valid server certificate is never accepted by the openfortivpn client.
- **Potential Man-in-the-Middle:** Although not explicitly stated, this could potentially be leveraged in a man-in-the-middle attack, if a malformed certificate that bypasses the faulty check is presented.
- **VPN Connection Failure:** The vulnerability prevents the establishment of a VPN connection with a properly configured server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attack occurs during the TLS handshake when the openfortivpn client attempts to validate the server's certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (Potential):** An attacker positioned as a man-in-the-middle could potentially exploit this vulnerability by presenting a malformed certificate, although the primary impact is simply the failure of a valid connection.
- **Server Certificate:** The attacker needs to control the server side, and present a certificate to the client.
- **Network Access:** Attacker must be positioned to intercept and modify traffic, or control a server.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue is present when using OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later with openfortivpn 1.11.0.
- The vulnerability is related to improper usage of the `X509_check_host` function.
- The fix involves ensuring that a proper, initialized buffer containing the hostname is passed to `X509_check_host`.
- The provided information also links CVE-2020-7042 with CVE-2020-7041 and CVE-2020-7043, which are all related to certificate validation issues in openfortivpn.
- Patches were released to address this issue in various distributions including openSUSE and Fedora.
