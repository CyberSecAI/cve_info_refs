Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-7627

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `execute()` function in the `node-key-sender` module takes an array of parameters (`arrParams`) that are directly passed to a command line execution without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization in the `execute()` function, which allows for command injection. Specifically, the user-controlled array `arrParams` is directly used to build a shell command string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and more.
- **Confidentiality Impact (High):** The vulnerability can lead to complete loss of confidentiality, as attackers can access any data on the system.
- **Integrity Impact (Low):** Attackers can modify data, but the extent and impact of modification might be limited.
- **Availability Impact (None):** The vulnerability doesn't directly cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, as demonstrated by the provided proof of concept.
- **Code Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious commands via the `arrParams` input of the `execute` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker doesn't need prior access to the system.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `arrParams` argument passed to the `execute` function. This likely means that the attacker has control over some part of the application's inputs.
- The attacker must be able to make the vulnerable code execute with the malicious input.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `key-sender.js` file of the `node-key-sender` package, specifically in the `execute` function.
- The `exec` function from Node.js' `child_process` module is used to execute the command with the unsanitized parameters.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
```javascript
var root = require("node-key-sender");
var attack_code = ["&touch", "Song"];
root.execute(attack_code);
```
This PoC demonstrates how to inject the command `touch Song` by passing `["&touch", "Song"]` as an argument, which creates a file named "Song".

**Mitigation:**
- There is no fixed version for `node-key-sender`.
- To prevent this, user-controlled data should never be directly used in a shell command.
- Implement proper sanitization of the user input by validating, filtering, and escaping special characters before passing it to the `exec` function.
- Ideally, avoid using `exec` function for sending keyboard events.

**CVSS Score:**
- Snyk: 6.5 (Medium)
- NVD: 9.8 (Critical)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can be classified as a Command Injection vulnerability, which is a type of CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) or CWE-78 (OS Command Injection) depending on whether the injection happens in a web context or a system command context. In this case it's more OS Command Injection.
- The Snyk report highlights that the attacker can control the `arrParams` without any sanitization, leading to the command injection vulnerability.
