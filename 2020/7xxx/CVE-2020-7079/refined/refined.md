Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-7079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper signature validation mechanism in Autodesk Dynamo BIM when automatically loading official Autodesk feature packages delivered at install time.
*   A certificate issued for one file can be reused with a maliciously crafted DLL file, allowing it to bypass the signature check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Signature Validation:** The vulnerability lies in how Dynamo BIM validates the signatures of its feature packages. It allows a malicious DLL to use a valid certificate from another file, tricking the system into believing the DLL is legitimate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a user is tricked into writing a malicious DLL into the installation area, it may lead to arbitrary code execution on the system. This means an attacker can potentially run any code on the victim's machine, leading to various malicious activities like data theft, malware installation, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DLL Placement:** An attacker needs to trick the user into placing a maliciously crafted DLL file into the installation directory of Autodesk Dynamo BIM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker needs some way to convince the user to write a malicious DLL into the vulnerable application's install directory. This might involve social engineering tactics.
*   **Write access to install directory:** An attacker needs to be able to write a malicious DLL into the vulnerable application's install directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Dynamo Sandbox versions 2.5.1 and 2.5.0.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.5.2.
*   Third-party packages manually installed via the Package Manager are not affected as they don't require signature validation. However, users are advised to make their own informed decisions about which third-party packages to trust.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
