# ReDoS vulnerability in websocket-extensions

On 1 June 2020 it was reported to me that a regular expression denial of service
(ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the [`websocket-extensions` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket-extensions).
This vulnerability was discovered by Robert McLaughlin and has been assigned the
identifier CVE-2020-7662.

In the course of investigating this issue I discovered that the [Ruby version of
`websocket-extensions`](https://rubygems.org/gems/websocket-extensions) contains the same flaw. The vulnerability in this
version has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7663.

To mitigate this issue, you should install one of these packages as appropriate
for your system:

* version 0.1.4 of the npm package
* version 0.1.5 of the rubygems package

All previous versions of these packages are vulnerable.

The ReDoS flaw allows an attacker to exhaust the server√¢¬Ä¬ôs capacity to process
incoming requests by sending a WebSocket handshake request containing a header
of the following form:

```
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b="\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...

```

That is, a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is
a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. The
parser takes exponential time to reject this header as invalid, and this will
block the processing of any other work on the same thread. Thus if you are
running a single-threaded server, such a request can render your service
completely unavailable.

I would like to thank [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for reporting this issue to me, and my employer
[dxw](https://www.dxw.com/) for giving me time to fix it.

## How to fix?

Upgrade `websocket-extensions` to version 0.1.4 or higher.

## Overview

[websocket-extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket-extensions) is a Generic extension manager for WebSocket connections

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). The `EXT_LIST` variable within extension `parser` may take quadratic time when parsing literal backslash (`\`) followed by any character, resulting in backtracking.

This could be abused by an attacker to conduct Regex Denial Of Service (ReDoS) on a single-threaded server by providing a malicious payload with the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header.

### PoC by Robert McLaughlin

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its original and legitimate users. There are many types of DoS attacks, ranging from trying to clog the network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines (a Distributed Denial of Service - DDoS - attack) to sending crafted requests that cause a system to crash or take a disproportional amount of time to process.

The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a type of Denial of Service attack. Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, but they aren't very intuitive and can ultimately end up making it easy for attackers to take your site down.

Let‚Äôs take the following regular expression as an example:

```
regex = /A(B|C+)+D/

```

This regular expression accomplishes the following:

* `A` The string must start with the letter 'A'
* `(B|C+)+` The string must then follow the letter A with either the letter 'B' or some number of occurrences of the letter 'C' (the `+` matches one or more times). The `+` at the end of this section states that we can look for one or more matches of this section.
* `D` Finally, we ensure this section of the string ends with a 'D'

The expression would match inputs such as `ABBD`, `ABCCCCD`, `ABCBCCCD` and `ACCCCCD`

It most cases, it doesn't take very long for a regex engine to find a match:

```
$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD")'
0.04s user 0.01s system 95% cpu 0.052 total

$ time node -e '/A(B|C+)+D/.test("ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCX")'
1.79s user 0.02s system 99% cpu 1.812 total

```

The entire process of testing it against a 30 characters long string takes around ~52ms. But when given an invalid string, it takes nearly two seconds to complete the test, over ten times as long as it took to test a valid string. The dramatic difference is due to the way regular expressions get evaluated.

Most Regex engines will work very similarly (with minor differences). The engine will match the first possible way to accept the current character and proceed to the next one. If it then fails to match the next one, it will backtrack and see if there was another way to digest the previous character. If it goes too far down the rabbit hole only to find out the string doesn‚Äôt match in the end, and if many characters have multiple valid regex paths, the number of backtracking steps can become very large, resulting in what is known as *catastrophic backtracking*.

Let's look at how our expression runs into this problem, using a shorter string: "ACCCX". While it seems fairly straightforward, there are still four different ways that the engine could match those three C's:

1. CCC
2. CC+C
3. C+CC
4. C+C+C.

The engine has to try each of those combinations to see if any of them potentially match against the expression. When you combine that with the other steps the engine must take, we can use [RegEx 101 debugger](https://regex101.com/debugger) to see the engine has to take a total of 38 steps before it can determine the string doesn't match.

From there, the number of steps the engine must use to validate a string just continues to grow.

| String | Number of C's | Number of steps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACCCX | 3 | 38 |
| ACCCCX | 4 | 71 |
| ACCCCCX | 5 | 136 |
| ACCCCCCCCCCCCCCX | 14 | 65,553 |

By the time the string includes 14 C's, the engine has to take over 65,000 steps just to see if the string is valid. These extreme situations can cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size, as shown above), allowing an attacker to exploit this and can cause the service to excessively consume CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service.

### CVSS Scores

### Snyk

8.2¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

Remove ReDoS vulnerability in the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header parser

```
There is a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in
the parser we use to process the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. It
can be exploited by sending an opening WebSocket handshake to a server
containing a header of the form:

    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a;b="\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...

i.e. a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose
content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other
character. The parser takes exponential time to reject this header as
invalid, and this can be used to exhaust the server's capacity to
process requests.

This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-7662](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g78m-2chm-r7qv "CVE-2020-7662") and
was reported by Robert McLaughlin.

We believe this flaw stems from the grammar specified for this header.
[RFC 6455][1] defines the grammar for the header as:

    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions = extension-list

    extension-list    = 1#extension
    extension         = extension-token *( ";" extension-param )
    extension-token   = registered-token
    registered-token  = token
    extension-param   = token [ "=" (token | quoted-string) ]

It refers to [RFC 2616][2] for the definitions of `token` and
`quoted-string`, which are:

    token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>
    separators     = "(" | ")" | "<" | ">" | "@"
                   | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | <">
                   | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="
                   | "{" | "}" | SP | HT

    quoted-string  = ( <"> *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) <"> )
    qdtext         = <any TEXT except <">>
    quoted-pair    = "\" CHAR

These rely on the `CHAR`, `CTL` and `TEXT` grammars, which are:

    CHAR           = <any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)>
    CTL            = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)>
    TEXT           = <any OCTET except CTLs, but including LWS>

Other relevant definitions to support these:

    OCTET          = <any 8-bit sequence of data>
    LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )
    CRLF           = CR LF

    HT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>
    LF             = <US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)>
    CR             = <US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)>
    SP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>

To expand some of these terms out and write them as regular expressions:

    OCTET         = [\x00-\xFF]
    CHAR          = [\x00-\x7F]
    TEXT          = [\t \x21-\x7E\x80-\xFF]

The allowable bytes for `token` are [\x00-\x7F], except [\x00-\x1F\x7F]
(leaving [\x20-\x7E]) and `separators`, which leaves the following set
of allowed chars:

    ! # $ % & ' * + - . ^ _ ` | ~ [0-9] [A-Z] [a-z]

`quoted-string` contains a repeated pattern of either `qdtext` or
`quoted-pair`. `qdtext` is any `TEXT` byte except <">, and the <">
character is ASCII 34, or 0x22. The <!> character is 0x21. So `qdtext`
can be written either positively as:

    qdtext        = [\t !\x23-\x7E\x80-\xFF]

or negatively, as:

    qdtext        = [^\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F"]

We use the negative definition here. The other alternative in the
`quoted-string` pattern is:

    quoted-pair   = \\[\x00-\x7F]

The problem is that the set of bytes matched by `qdtext` includes <\>,
and intersects with the second element of `quoted-pair`. That means the
sequence \c can be matched as either two `qdtext` bytes, or as a single
`quoted-pair`. When the regex engine fails to find a trailing <"> to
close the string, it back-tracks and tries every alternate parse for the
string, which doubles with each pair of bytes in the input.

To fix the ReDoS flaw we need to rewrite the repeating pattern so that
none of its alternate branches can match the same text. For example, we
could try dividing the set of bytes [\x00-\xFF] into those that must not
follow a <\>, those that may follow a <\>, and those that must be
preceded by <\>, and thereby construct a pattern of the form:

    (A|\?B|\C)*

where A, B and C have no characters in common. In our case the three
branch patterns would be:

    A   =   qdtext - CHAR   =   [\x80-\xFF]
    B   =   qdtext & CHAR   =   [\t !\x23-\x7E]
    C   =   CHAR - qdtext   =   [\x00-\x08\x0A-\x1F\x7F"]

These sets do not intersect, and notice <"> appears in set C so must be
preceded by <\>. But we still have a problem: <\> (0x5C) and all the
alphabetic characters are in set B, so the pattern \?B can match all
these:

    c
    \
    \c

So the sequence \c\c\c... still produces exponential back-tracking. It
also fails to parse input like this correctly:

    Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b="c\", d"

Because the grammar allows a single backslash to appear by itself, this
is arguably a syntax error where the parameter `b` has value `c\` and
then a new extension `d` begins with a <"> appearing where it should
not.

So the core problem is with the grammar itself: `qdtext` matches a
single backslash <\>, and `quoted-pair` matches a pair <\\>. So given a
sequence of backslashes there's no canonical parse and the grammar is
ambiguous.

[RFC 7230][3] remedies this problem and makes the grammar clearer.
First, it defines `token` explicitly rather than implicitly:

    token          = 1*tchar

    tchar          = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*"
                   / "+" / "-" / "." / "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~"
                   / DIGIT / ALPHA

And second, it defines `quoted-string` so that backslashes cannot appear
on their own:

     quoted-string  = DQUOTE *( qdtext / quoted-pair ) DQUOTE
     qdtext         = HTAB / SP /%x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E / obs-text
     obs-text       = %x80-FF
     quoted-pair    = "\" ( HTAB / SP / VCHAR / obs-text )

where VCHAR is any printing ASCII character 0x21-0x7E. Notice `qdtext`
is just our previous definition but with 5C excluded, so it cannot
accept a single backslash.

This commit makes this modification to our matching patterns, and
thereby removes the ReDoS vector. Technically this means it does not
match the grammar of RFC 6455, but we expect this to have little or no
practical impact, especially since the one main protocol extension,
`permessage-deflate` ([RFC 7692][4]), does not have any string-valued
parameters.

# ReDoS vulnerability in websocket-extensions

On 1 June 2020 it was reported to me that a regular expression denial of service
(ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the [`websocket-extensions` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket-extensions).
This vulnerability was discovered by Robert McLaughlin and has been assigned the
identifier CVE-2020-7662.

In the course of investigating this issue I discovered that the [Ruby version of
`websocket-extensions`](https://rubygems.org/gems/websocket-extensions) contains the same flaw. The vulnerability in this
version has been assigned the identifier CVE-2020-7663.

To mitigate this issue, you should install one of these packages as appropriate
for your system:

* version 0.1.4 of the npm package
* version 0.1.5 of the rubygems package

All previous versions of these packages are vulnerable.

The ReDoS flaw allows an attacker to exhaust the server√¢¬Ä¬ôs capacity to process
incoming requests by sending a WebSocket handshake request containing a header
of the following form:

```
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b="\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...

```

That is, a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is
a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. The
parser takes exponential time to reject this header as invalid, and this will
block the processing of any other work on the same thread. Thus if you are
running a single-threaded server, such a request can render your service
completely unavailable.

I would like to thank [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for reporting this issue to me, and my employer
[dxw](https://www.dxw.com/) for giving me time to fix it.

# websocket-extensions [Build status](http://travis-ci.org/faye/websocket-extensions-node)

A minimal framework that supports the implementation of WebSocket extensions in
a way that's decoupled from the main protocol. This library aims to allow a
WebSocket extension to be written and used with any protocol library, by
defining abstract representations of frames and messages that allow modules to
co-operate.

`websocket-extensions` provides a container for registering extension plugins,
and provides all the functions required to negotiate which extensions to use
during a session via the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. By implementing the
APIs defined in this document, an extension may be used by any WebSocket library
based on this framework.

## Installation

```
$ npm install websocket-extensions

```
## Usage

There are two main audiences for this library: authors implementing the
WebSocket protocol, and authors implementing extensions. End users of a
WebSocket library or an extension should be able to use any extension by passing
it as an argument to their chosen protocol library, without needing to know how
either of them work, or how the `websocket-extensions` framework operates.

The library is designed with the aim that any protocol implementation and any
extension can be used together, so long as they support the same abstract
representation of frames and messages.

### Data types

The APIs provided by the framework rely on two data types; extensions will
expect to be given data and to be able to return data in these formats:

#### *Frame*

*Frame* is a structure representing a single WebSocket frame of any type. Frames
are simple objects that must have at least the following properties, which
represent the data encoded in the frame:

| property | description |
| --- | --- |
| `final` | `true` if the `FIN` bit is set, `false` otherwise |
| `rsv1` | `true` if the `RSV1` bit is set, `false` otherwise |
| `rsv2` | `true` if the `RSV2` bit is set, `false` otherwise |
| `rsv3` | `true` if the `RSV3` bit is set, `false` otherwise |
| `opcode` | the numeric opcode (`0`, `1`, `2`, `8`, `9`, or `10`) of the frame |
| `masked` | `true` if the `MASK` bit is set, `false` otherwise |
| `maskingKey` | a 4-byte `Buffer` if `masked` is `true`, otherwise `null` |
| `payload` | a `Buffer` containing the (unmasked) application data |

#### *Message*

A *Message* represents a complete application message, which can be formed from
text, binary and continuation frames. It has the following properties:

| property | description |
| --- | --- |
| `rsv1` | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV1` bit set |
| `rsv2` | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV2` bit set |
| `rsv3` | `true` if the first frame of the message has the `RSV3` bit set |
| `opcode` | the numeric opcode (`1` or `2`) of the first frame of the message |
| `data` | the concatenation of all the frame payloads in the message |

### For driver authors

A driver author is someone implementing the WebSocket protocol proper, and who
wishes end users to be able to use WebSocket extensions with their library.

At the start of a WebSocket session, on both the client and the server side,
they should begin by creating an extension container and adding whichever
extensions they want to use.

```
var√Ç¬†Extensions√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†require('websocket-extensions'),√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†deflate√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†require('permessage-deflate');√Ç¬†var√Ç¬†exts√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†new√Ç¬†Extensions();exts.add(deflate);
```

In the following examples, `exts` refers to this `Extensions` instance.

#### Client sessions

Clients will use the methods `generateOffer()` and `activate(header)`.

As part of the handshake process, the client must send a
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to advertise that it supports the registered
extensions. This header should be generated using:

```
request.headers['sec-websocket-extensions']√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†exts.generateOffer();
```

This returns a string, for example `"permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits"`, that represents all the extensions the client is
offering to use, and their parameters. This string may contain multiple offers
for the same extension.

When the client receives the handshake response from the server, it should pass
the incoming `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header in to `exts` to activate the
extensions the server has accepted:

```
exts.activate(response.headers['sec-websocket-extensions']);
```

If the server has sent any extension responses that the client does not
recognize, or are in conflict with one another for use of RSV bits, or that use
invalid parameters for the named extensions, then `exts.activate()` will
`throw`. In this event, the client driver should fail the connection with
closing code `1010`.

#### Server sessions

Servers will use the method `generateResponse(header)`.

A server session needs to generate a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header to send
in its handshake response:

```
var√Ç¬†clientOffer√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†request.headers['sec-websocket-extensions'],√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†extResponse√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†exts.generateResponse(clientOffer);√Ç¬†response.headers['sec-websocket-extensions']√Ç¬†=√Ç¬†extResponse;
```

Calling `exts.generateResponse(header)` activates those extensions the client
has asked to use, if they are registered, asks each extension for a set of
response parameters, and returns a string containing the response parameters for
all accepted extensions.

#### In both directions

Both clients and servers will use the methods `validFrameRsv(frame)`,
`processIncomingMessage(message)` and `processOutgoingMessage(message)`.

The WebSocket protocol requires that frames do not have any of the `RSV` bits
set unless there is an extension in use that allows otherwise. When processing
an incoming frame, sessions should pass a *Frame* object to:

```
exts.validFrameRsv(frame)
```

If this method returns `false`, the session should fail the WebSocket connection
with closing code `1002`.

To pass incoming messages through the extension stack, a session should
construct a *Message* object according to the above datatype definitions, and
call:

```
exts.processIncomingMessage(message,√Ç¬†function(error,√Ç¬†msg)√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†√Ç¬†//√Ç¬†hand√Ç¬†the√Ç¬†message√Ç¬†off√Ç¬†to√Ç¬†the√Ç¬†application});
```

If any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an
error and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code
`1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `msg` should be passed on to the application.

To pass outgoing messages through the extension stack, a session should
construct a *Message* as before, and call:

```
exts.processOutgoingMessage(message,√Ç¬†function(error,√Ç¬†msg)√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†√Ç¬†//√Ç¬†write√Ç¬†message√Ç¬†to√Ç¬†the√Ç¬†transport});
```

If any extensions fail to process the message, then the callback will yield an
error and the session should fail the WebSocket connection with closing code
`1010`. If `error` is `null`, then `message` should be converted into frames
(with the message's `rsv1`, `rsv2`, `rsv3` and `opcode` set on the first frame)
and written to the transport.

At the end of the WebSocket session (either when the protocol is explicitly
ended or the transport connection disconnects), the driver should call:

```
exts.close(function()√Ç¬†{})
```

The callback is invoked when all extensions have finished processing any
messages in the pipeline and it's safe to close the socket.

### For extension authors

An extension author is someone implementing an extension that transforms
WebSocket messages passing between the client and server. They would like to
implement their extension once and have it work with any protocol library.

Extension authors will not install `websocket-extensions` or call it directly.
Instead, they should implement the following API to allow their extension to
plug into the `websocket-extensions` framework.

An `Extension` is any object that has the following properties:

| property | description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | a string containing the name of the extension as used in negotiation headers |
| `type` | a string, must be `"permessage"` |
| `rsv1` | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV1 bit, `false` otherwise |
| `rsv2` | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV2 bit, `false` otherwise |
| `rsv3` | either `true` if the extension uses the RSV3 bit, `false` otherwise |

It must also implement the following methods:

```
ext.createClientSession()
```

This returns a *ClientSession*, whose interface is defined below.

```
ext.createServerSession(offers)
```

This takes an array of offer params and returns a *ServerSession*, whose
interface is defined below. For example, if the client handshake contains the
offer header:

```
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; server_no_context_takeover; server_max_window_bits=8, \
                          permessage-deflate; server_max_window_bits=15

```

then the `permessage-deflate` extension will receive the call:

```
ext.createServerSession([√Ç¬†√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†server_no_context_takeover:√Ç¬†true,√Ç¬†server_max_window_bits:√Ç¬†8√Ç¬†},√Ç¬†√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†server_max_window_bits:√Ç¬†15√Ç¬†}]);
```

The extension must decide which set of parameters it wants to accept, if any,
and return a *ServerSession* if it wants to accept the parameters and `null`
otherwise.

#### *ClientSession*

A *ClientSession* is the type returned by `ext.createClientSession()`. It must
implement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.

```
clientSession.generateOffer()//√Ç¬†e.g.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†->√Ç¬†[//√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†server_no_context_takeover:√Ç¬†true,√Ç¬†server_max_window_bits:√Ç¬†8√Ç¬†},//√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†server_max_window_bits:√Ç¬†15√Ç¬†}//√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†]
```

This must return a set of parameters to include in the client's
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` offer header. If the session wants to offer multiple
configurations, it can return an array of sets of parameters as shown above.

```
clientSession.activate(params)√Ç¬†//√Ç¬†->√Ç¬†true
```

This must take a single set of parameters from the server's handshake response
and use them to configure the client session. If the client accepts the given
parameters, then this method must return `true`. If it returns any other value,
the framework will interpret this as the client rejecting the response, and will
`throw`.

#### *ServerSession*

A *ServerSession* is the type returned by `ext.createServerSession(offers)`. It
must implement the following methods, as well as the *Session* API listed below.

```
serverSession.generateResponse()//√Ç¬†e.g.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†->√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†server_max_window_bits:√Ç¬†8√Ç¬†}
```

This returns the set of parameters the server session wants to send in its
`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` response header. Only one set of parameters is
returned to the client per extension. Server sessions that would confict on
their use of RSV bits are not activated.

#### *Session*

The *Session* API must be implemented by both client and server sessions. It
contains two methods, `processIncomingMessage(message)` and
`processOutgoingMessage(message)`.

```
session.processIncomingMessage(message,√Ç¬†function(error,√Ç¬†msg)√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†...√Ç¬†})
```

The session must implement this method to take an incoming *Message* as defined
above, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If
there is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as
the first argument.

```
session.processOutgoingMessage(message,√Ç¬†function(error,√Ç¬†msg)√Ç¬†{√Ç¬†...√Ç¬†})
```

The session must implement this method to take an outgoing *Message* as defined
above, transform it in any way it needs, then return it via the callback. If
there is an error processing the message, this method should yield an error as
the first argument.

Note that both `processIncomingMessage()` and `processOutgoingMessage()` can
perform their logic asynchronously, are allowed to process multiple messages
concurrently, and are not required to complete working on messages in the same
order the messages arrive. `websocket-extensions` will reorder messages as your
extension emits them and will make sure every extension is given messages in the
order they arrive from the driver. This allows extensions to maintain state that
depends on the messages' wire order, for example keeping a DEFLATE compression
context between messages.

```
session.close()
```

The framework will call this method when the WebSocket session ends, allowing
the session to release any resources it's using.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù represents an individual User‚Äôs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User‚Äôs identity on GitHub. ‚ÄúOrganizations‚Äù are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the ‚ÄúTerms of Service‚Äù or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. ‚ÄúContent‚Äù refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. ‚ÄúUser-Generated Content‚Äù is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. ‚ÄúGitHub,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe,‚Äù and ‚ÄúUs‚Äù refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The ‚ÄúService‚Äù refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. ‚ÄúThe User,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour‚Äù refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù refers to GitHub‚Äôs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub‚Äôs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization‚Äôs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User‚Äôs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country‚Äôs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country‚Äôs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person ‚Äî i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us ‚Äî and other GitHub Users ‚Äî certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement‚Äîfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn‚Äôt available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it‚Äôs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub‚Äôs confidential information (collectively, ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don‚Äôt otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important ‚Äî we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo.

# ReDoS vulnerability in Sec-WebSocket-Extensions parser

High

[jcoglan](/jcoglan)
published
GHSA-g78m-2chm-r7qv
Jun 2, 2020

## Package

npm

websocket-extensions
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 0.1.4

## Patched versions

0.1.4

## Description

### Impact

The ReDoS flaw allows an attacker to exhaust the server's capacity to process

incoming requests by sending a WebSocket handshake request containing a header

of the following form:

```
Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: a; b="\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c\c ...

```

That is, a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is

a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. The

parser takes exponential time to reject this header as invalid, and this will

block the processing of any other work on the same thread. Thus if you are

running a single-threaded server, such a request can render your service

completely unavailable.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 0.1.4.

### Workarounds

There are no known work-arounds other than disabling any public-facing

WebSocket functionality you are operating.

### References
