Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of object keys within the `apply` function of the `json8` library's `merge-patch` package. Specifically, the function does not properly sanitize input keys, allowing an attacker to inject the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is a prototype pollution vulnerability. By injecting `__proto__` as a key in the patch, an attacker can modify the prototype of all JavaScript objects within the application using the vulnerable function.
- **Unsafe Object Merging**: The `apply` function in `merge-patch` performs an unsafe merge of objects without proper sanitization or checks, enabling the pollution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By polluting the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can cause JavaScript exceptions leading to a denial of service. This is achievable by overriding generic functions such as `toString` or `valueOf` to an unexpected type.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In scenarios where the codebase evaluates a property of an object and executes it (e.g., `eval(someobject.someattr)`), an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution by polluting a relevant property.
- **Property Injection:** An attacker can inject or modify existing properties the application relies on, such as security properties like cookies, tokens or admin flags.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `apply` function of the `merge-patch` package in the `json8` library.
- By crafting a malicious patch object with a `__proto__` key, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when it is merged with another object using the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted patch object containing the `__proto__` key to the vulnerable `apply` function. 
-  The attacker needs to be able to influence the merge operation by providing the malicious patch.
-  This could be achieved via client-side attacks (if user-provided data is used in merge operations), or through any attack vector that allows the attacker to control the `patch` parameter.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `json8` prior to 1.0.3.
- The fix implemented in version 1.0.3 includes a check for the `__proto__` key and throws an error if present, thus preventing prototype pollution. Additionally, the fix allows optionally disabling the protection by passing `{pollute: true}` as an option to the `apply` function.
- The fix also addresses the possibility of an attacker specifying the prototype by passing `{proto: <object>}` as an option.
- The Snyk vulnerability database entry provides CVSS scores (7.3 High) and NVD scores (9.8 Critical) for this vulnerability, providing more specific details on the potential impact.

In summary, this is a prototype pollution vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects, which can have a range of impacts, from a denial of service to remote code execution, if the application handles user provided data unsafely.
