Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-7762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when handling file URLs in the `jsreport-chrome-pdf` package. Specifically, the code does not sufficiently restrict the paths that can be accessed through file requests, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server hosting the application using `jsreport-chrome-pdf`.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to use relative paths (e.g., `../../..`) to navigate outside of the intended directory and access files on the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing passwords, configuration files, or other confidential data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTML URL that is processed by `jsreport-chrome-pdf`.  Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by including JavaScript that redirects to a crafted file URL using a relative path, which then gets processed by the `jsreport-chrome-pdf` library.
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HTML to the application using `jsreport-chrome-pdf`.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `lib/conversion.js` file of the `jsreport-chrome-pdf` package.
- The proof of concept (PoC) provided demonstrates this using javascript that redirects to a file URL using `../../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check for requests that start with `file:///` and are not relative to the HTML URL in the request, and aborting them.
- The affected versions are prior to 1.10.0. Version 1.10.0 or higher includes the fix.
- Snyk's CVSS score for the vulnerability is 6.5 (Medium) which is consistent with the NVD score. The CVSS vector indicates it is remotely exploitable with low complexity, low privileges required, and no user interaction needed, with a high confidentiality impact.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2020-7762 is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the `jsreport-chrome-pdf` package that can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTML URL. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation when processing file URLs which allows directory traversal.
