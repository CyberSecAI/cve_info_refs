Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-7677:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `thenify` package uses the `eval` function to create a wrapper around an input function. The `name` property of the input function is directly incorporated into the string passed to `eval` without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the unsanitized use of `eval`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `name` property of a function passed to `thenify`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server or client running the vulnerable code. This could potentially lead to:
    - Data breaches by reading sensitive information
    - Data modification or deletion
    - System compromise, including denial of service or complete takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `name` property of a function passed as an argument to the `thenify` function. An attacker can craft a function with a malicious `name` property to execute arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the function passed as input to `thenify`. This might involve manipulating data or parameters that are used to construct functions that are subsequently passed to the vulnerable `thenify` function.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability arises in the `createWrapper` function of `index.js` in the `thenify` package.
- The fix involves removing the use of `eval` and constructing the wrapper function dynamically instead.
- The vulnerable code snippet shows how the name property is inserted directly into a string and evaluated, for example:
```javascript
return eval(createWrapper($$__fn__$$.name, options))
```
- A proof of concept is provided in the Snyk advisory:
```javascript
var a = require("thenify");
var attack_code = "fs=require('fs');fs.writeFile('Song', 'test',function(){})";
function cur(){};
Object.defineProperty(cur, "name", { value: "fake() {" + attack_code + ";})();(function(){//"});
a(cur);
```
This demonstrates how a crafted function with a malicious name can be used to execute arbitrary code (in this case, writing a file).

**Summary of Fix:**
The vulnerability was resolved by removing the use of `eval` in the `createWrapper` function and constructing the wrapper function dynamically.
