---

I couldn't find a note-taking app that ticked all the boxes I'm interested in: notes are written and rendered in GitHub Flavored Markdown, no WYSIWYG, no proprietary formats, I can run a search & replace across all notes, notes support attachments, the app isn't bloated, the app has a pretty interface, tags are indefinitely nestable and can import Evernote notes (because that's what I was using before).

So I built my own.

## [Comparison](https://notable.app/static/images/comparison.png)

[![Click to Enlarge](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/793445d655d445d1c5ce39e1cec80454122bfff58ea3401c8d9496e0ae2a0a42/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f636f6d70617269736f6e2e706e67)](https://notable.app/static/images/comparison.png)

Part of this comparison is personal opinion: you may disagree on the UI front, things I consider bloat may be considered features by somebody else etc. but hopefully this comparison did a good job at illustrating the main differences.

## Features

### Markdown-based

Notes are written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, and you can also write [KaTeX](https://katex.org) expressions, [Mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) diagrams and so much more, check out our full [Markdown cheatsheet](https://cheatsheet.notable.app).

Notable also gives you a very powerful Markdown editor, it's the same one VS Code uses in fact, so features like multi-cursors, a minimap and best-in-class syntax highlighting are built-in.

[![Editor](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/56f88303ef0cbfa3e4e5e38a2b1272f755b89db3f8c3d0a03ab90b2dd7ddcad1/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f74732f656469746f725f6d61632e706e673f6e6f2d77656270)](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-editor.png)

### No Vendor Lock-In

Notes and attachments are simply stored on your disk, this is extremely portable and powerful: you could edit your notes with your favorite editor, have them synchronized via Dropbox, run Git on them, run a regex-based search and replace on them etc.

[![Filesystem](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b0a5d5b2f4bff96f8667bf12db5a5c8c910da3364e44f995c8f75f49123bf6d9/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f74732f66696c6573797374656d5f6d61632e706e673f6e6f2d77656270)](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-filesystem.png)

### Dark Theme

A dark theme is also available. In the future support for [custom themes](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/104) will be added as well.

If you'd like to change a color or hide a button you are also free to do that via the Devtools.

[![Dark Theme](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ff8d1e56c3b576d170979c23c2b549ca784ba6bc9b6a6431261d83964085339f/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f74732f6461726b5f6d61632e706e673f6e6f2d77656270)](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-dark.png)

### Zen Mode

Zen mode provides a minimalistic editing and reading experience, hiding everything that's not necessary.

Notable is also keyboard friendly, has a [quick open](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-quickopen.png) window, and we'll soon add a [command palette](https://github.com/notable/notable/issues/338) too, so you won't have to click any buttons if you don't want to.

[![Zen Mode](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3abdf03840d7fd93e69b229a8d53eb06ef711731e8b0da4f28555451cace87f0/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f74732f7a656e5f6d61632e706e673f6e6f2d77656270)](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-zen.png)

### Multi-Note Editor

A multi-note editor is available for quickly running an action, like favoriting, pinning, deleting, tagging etc., on multiple notes at once.

If you need to run a more complex action on your notes remember that they are just file stored on your disk so you can do whatever you want with them.

[![Multi-Note Editor](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8558e8aa2100c09c7f1ce2aa64b03b3f4503d13b9f324855410c7224e33afda8/68747470733a2f2f6e6f7461626c652e6170702f7374617469632f696d616765732f73637265656e73686f74732f6d756c7469656469746f725f6d61632e706e673f6e6f2d77656270)](https://img.notable.app/screenshot-multieditor.png)

### Split Editor

A split-editor is available for quickly checking out how your note will be rendered while you're editing it.

RCE using XSS in Electron applications

## TL;DR

Notable 1.8.4 allows XSS via crafted Markdown text, with resultant remote code execution (because nodeIntegration in webPreferences is true).

## About Notable

[Notable](https://notable.app/) is a markdown-based note-taking app that is developed using Electron framework. Notable was originally released as open-source but newer versions of it are no longer open-source.

![]()
## Electron and Node Integration

Electron is a framework that enables you to create desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These applications can then be packaged to run directly on macOS, Windows, or Linux, or distributed via the Mac App Store or the Microsoft Store.

From a development perspective, an Electron application is essentially a Node.js application.

The main script specifies the entry point of your Electron application (in our case, the `main.js` file) that will run the Main process. Typically, the script that runs in the Main process controls the lifecycle of the application, displays the graphical user interface and its elements, performs native operating system interactions, and creates Renderer processes within web pages. An Electron application can have only one Main process.

Each window can optionally be granted with full access to Node.js API through the `nodeIntegration` preference.

```
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')function createWindow() {
    const win = new BrowserWindow({
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        webPreferences: {
            nodeIntegration: true
        }
    })
    win.loadFile('index.html')
}
```
## Exploitation

After installing Notable we reverse-engineered the app.asar file which reveals that nodeIntegration is set to true.

![]()

After trying some simple XSS payloads we can see that the markdown parser does not sanitize the input properly, hence we are able to run arbitrary javascript code.

![]()

As nodeIntegration is set to true we have access to Node.js API. We can use the [shell](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/shell) module in Electron to call an external URI. For PoC we are calling calc.exe using the following payload.

```
<a onmouseover="try{ const {shell} = require('electron'); shell.openExternal('file:C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe') }catch(e){alert(e)}">Harmless Link</a>
```
