Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16608:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied Markdown input within the Notable application. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code through crafted Markdown text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize Markdown input, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks. Specifically, the application allows the `onmouseover` event to execute javascript within the context of the application
*   **Node.js Integration:** The Electron application has `nodeIntegration` set to `true`. This grants the renderer process (where the XSS occurs) access to Node.js APIs, which can be leveraged for more severe attacks, including remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By leveraging the Node.js `shell` module, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This can include running malicious executables or scripts, giving the attacker full control over the system.
*   **Complete System Access:** Because the attacker can execute arbitrary code, the impact is that they can gain complete access to the victim's system.
*   **Data theft:** An attacker can steal sensitive data such as local files, application credentials, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Markdown:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted Markdown document that contains malicious JavaScript code within the content that is rendered by the Notable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted Markdown document to a user of the Notable application. This could involve luring the victim to open a malicious note file or pasting the crafted markdown into the application.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the application's markdown parser does not properly sanitize input, and because `nodeIntegration` is set to `true`.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses the `shell.openExternal` function to launch `calc.exe`, which demonstrates RCE, but could be used to run any local or remote executable.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed publicly on 2020-12-10 after it was reported to the developer in 2020-04-24 and was confirmed to be unfixed as of v1.9.0-beta.
*   The vulnerability was found in Notable version 1.8.4.
