Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-16194

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Opartdevis module for Prestashop. Specifically, the `delivery_address` and `invoice_address` fields are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **IDOR:** The module fails to properly validate or authorize access to user data related to addresses. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `delivery_address` and `invoice_address` parameters to access addresses associated with arbitrary users.
- **Lack of authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information like delivery and invoice addresses of any user on the vulnerable Prestashop store. This information can potentially include names, street addresses, phone numbers, and other personal details.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to the `createquotation` controller of the `opartdevis` module.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `delivery_address` and `invoice_address` parameters, along with other parameters of the request, to specify the target user's address. The `opart_devis_customer_id` is set to `-1` which indicates that it bypasses the validation for the customer ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Prestashop instance.
- **No User Credentials Required:** The attacker does not require any user credentials or be logged in to exploit this vulnerability, it is unauthenticated.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves sending a POST request to the following URL `http://localhost/index.php?fc=module&module=opartdevis&controller=createquotation&change_carrier_cart`
- The POST request includes the following parameters: `opart_devis_customer_id=-1&delivery_address=1&invoice_address=0&opart_devis_carrier_input=1&selected_carrier=0`
- The values `1` and `0` in `delivery_address` and `invoice_address` are used to retrieve delivery and invoice address information.
- By manipulating these values, the attacker can potentially enumerate and access the addresses of other users.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the Opartdevis module prior to 4.0.2
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can retrieve information without needing to be logged in.
