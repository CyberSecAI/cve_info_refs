### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Healthcare and Public Health
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Netherlands

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Julian Suleder, Nils Emmerich, Birk Kauer of ERNW Research GmbH, Dr. Oliver Matula of ERNW Enno, and Rey Netzwerke GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Germany, in the context of the BSI project ManiMed (Manipulation of medical devices), which reported these to Philips.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Note: To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to gain either physical access to surveillance stations and patient monitors or access to the medical device network.

Philips released the following versions to remediate reported vulnerabilities:

* Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Version C.03
* PerformanceBridge Focal Point
* IntelliVue Patient Monitors Versions N.00 and N.01
* IntelliVue Patient Monitors Version M.04: Contact a [Philips service support team](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions) for an upgrade path
* Certificate revocation within the system was implemented for PIC iX and Performance Bridge FocalPoint in 2023. The implementation of the IntelliVue Patient Monitors will be completed in Q3 of 2024.

As a mitigation to these vulnerabilities, Philips recommends the following:

* The Philips patient monitoring network is required to be physically or logically isolated from the hospital local area network (LAN). Philips recommends using a firewall or routers that can implement access control lists restricting access in and out of the patient monitoring network for only necessary ports and IP addresses. Refer to the Philips Patient Monitoring System Security for Clinical Networks guide for additional information on [InCenter](https://incenter.medical.philips.com/).
* By default, the simple certificate enrollment protocol (SCEP) service is not running. When needed, the service is configured to run based on the duration or the number of certificates to be assigned. One certificate is default, but if a certificate is not issued, the service will continue to run. Limit exposure by ensuring the SCEP service is not running unless it is actively being used to enroll new devices.
* When enrolling new devices using SCEP, enter a unique challenge password of 8-12 unpredictable and randomized digits.
* Implement physical security controls to prevent unauthorized login attempts on the PIC iX application. Servers should be kept in controlled locked data centers. Access to equipment at nurses' stations should be controlled and monitored.
* Only grant remote access to PIC iX servers on a must-have basis.
* Grant login privileges to the bedside monitor and PIC iX application on a role-based, least-privilege basis, and only to trusted users.

Users with questions regarding their specific Philips Patient Information Center (PIC iX) and/or IntelliVue patient monitor installations and new release eligibility should contact their local [Philips service support team, or regional service support](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions), or call 1-800-722-9377.

Please see the [Philips product security website](https://www.philips.com/productsecurity) for the Philips advisory and the latest security information for Philips products.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Implement physical security measures to limit or control access to critical systems.
* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.
* Apply defense-in-depth strategies.
* Disable unnecessary accounts and services.
* Where additional information is needed, refer to existing [cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm)

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.

## Philips Product Security **Designed-In**

In recognition of the critical role security plays across today’s interconnected digital ecosystem, Philips is committed to the articulation and execution of a comprehensive security plan that assures the safety of patient, personal, and business data. We have updated our Product Security Statement to reflect the rapidly changing security environment and our response to provide designed-in security with our products to meet the latest challenges.

        [Product Security Statement (PDF) (2.27MB)](https://www.philips.com/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.pdf "Product Security Statement (opens in a new window)")                [![product security download (.pdf) file](/c-dam/corporate/security/master/mh01/cybersecurity-paper-thumb.png "(opens in a new window)")       2.27 MB](/c-dam/b2bhc/master/About-Us/customer-support/cyber-security-position-paper.download.pdf "product security download (.pdf) file")
### Security status

Philips Product Security Status documents have product-specific vulnerability updates and security-related information such as supported anti-virus software, OS security features, and remote service.

Each product has its own table and the products are separated by modality, i.e. Informatics, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance, etc. The Status Documents list known software vulnerabilities, the current status, and Recommended Customer Action.

Revised tables are posted regularly with the latest available information.

### Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security

 As part of our commitment to product security and customer service, Philips Healthcare supplies our customers with information to help assess and address the vulnerabilities and risks associated with products that maintain or transmit ePHI.

Specifically, Philips Healthcare is using the Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS²) to provide security information about its products.

The MDS² contains product specific security information such as:

* Maintaining, storing, and transmitting ePHI
* Data back-up and removable media capabilities
* Installing security patches and anti-virus software
* Remote service access
* Audit logs of ePHI access including: Viewing; creating, modifying, and deleting records; importing/exporting

The MDS², a universal reporting form which allows Philips Healthcare to supply its customers with model-specific information, is endorsed by the American College of Clinical Engineering (ACCE), ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute), the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS).

The form also contains security practice recommendations and explanatory notes from the manufacturer as well as detailed.

        [Form](https://philips.mizecx.com/cc?tabid=867 "Form (opens in a new window)")
