## Description

![@job](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153816?u=94daa90cdfb442be3ed7a7b37752a58d58d0efd9&v=4&size=48)[job](https://github.com/job)opened [on Mar 24, 2020](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3/issues/159#issue-586971181)

RFC 8182 section 4.3 "HTTPS Considerations" states:

> Because of this, Relying Parties SHOULD do TLS certificate and host name validation when they fetch from an RRDP Repository Server.

The *SHOULD* probably should be read as a *MUST*, given the validator's susceptibility to fetch from a compromised (MITM'ed) RRDP service - especially when combined with a partial withholding attack. Note: checking the TLS certs of the RRDP channel makes MITM's harder - but not impossible! More work is needed in the validation procedure regardless of fixing this TLS RRDP issue.

Recommendation: `rpki.validator.rrdp.trust.all.tls.certificates=true` should be changed to `rpki.validator.rrdp.trust.all.tls.certificates=false` in the default distribution & settings. It is hard to imagine a scenario where one would want to disable TLS certificate validation.
