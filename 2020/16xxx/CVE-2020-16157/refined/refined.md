  "CVE-2020-16157": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in Nagios Log Server version 2.1.6. This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Full Name' or 'Username' fields on the user profile page or the user creation page. This malicious script is then executed when an administrator views the user list while creating or editing an alert.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the 'Full Name' or 'Username' fields when creating or editing a user. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into these fields. The injected script is then executed when the user list is rendered.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stored XSS"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users (e.g., an administrator). This can lead to stealing cookies, user redirection, arbitrary actions on victim's behalf, keylogging, and other malicious activities.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "The attack vector is via the user profile or user creation page in Nagios Log Server, accessible to authenticated users."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an authenticated user account on the affected Nagios Log Server. No special privileges are required.",
       "additional_info": "The vulnerability was fixed in Nagios Log Server version 2.1.7. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to a patched version.  The vulnerable fields are in the  **/profile** page or **/admin/users/create** page of the Nagios Log Server software."
