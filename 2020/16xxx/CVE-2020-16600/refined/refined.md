- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `fz_drop_band_writer` function within MuPDF. This happens when a valid page is followed by a page with invalid pixmap dimensions. The `bander` (static variable) then points to previously freed memory instead of a new `band_writer`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for an invalid read, potentially leading to crashes or other undefined behavior. This could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code or disclose sensitive information by manipulating memory.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted PDF file that contains a valid page followed by a page with invalid pixmap dimensions to the `mutool draw` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF to the vulnerable application.
