Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-16292:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow located in the `mj_raster_cmd` function within the `contrib/japanese/gdevmjc.c` file. This function is part of the Japanese character processing module in Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to write data past the allocated memory buffer, leading to a memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap overflow can cause Ghostscript to crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: It is mentioned that processing a specially crafted file could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, however, this is not explicitly demonstrated or clarified as part of the provided context.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing of malformed document files: The vulnerability is triggered when Ghostscript processes specially crafted PostScript/PDF files containing malicious data related to Japanese character handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious crafted file that will be processed by the Ghostscript interpreter either directly or via a dependent application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, and can trigger it remotely via a malicious document file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report mentions the vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer (ASan).
- The issue was fixed by commit `863ada11f9a942a622a581312e2be022d9e2a6f7` in the Ghostscript repository.
- Several other CVEs were fixed in the same update.
- The vulnerable code is located in `contrib/japanese/gdevmjc.c` , specifically in the function `mj_raster_cmd` at line 670.
