Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-16587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the `chunkOffsetReconstruction` function within `ImfMultiPartInputFile.cpp`. This occurs during the reconstruction of chunk offsets in a multipart OpenEXR image file. The issue arises from an incorrect part number range check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** An out-of-bounds read occurs because the code reads beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code reads an 8-byte value at a memory location that is located outside the allocated region for the `TileOffsets` structure.
- **Incorrect part number range check:** The code incorrectly uses `>` instead of `>=` when checking the part number, leading to access of an invalid index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow leads to an application crash due to a segmentation fault (SEGV). This can prevent the processing of OpenEXR files, rendering the application unusable.
- The Debian LTS advisory also mentions "excessive memory consumption" as a potential impact

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted OpenEXR file:** An attacker can craft a malformed OpenEXR image file that, when processed by an application using the vulnerable OpenEXR library, triggers the heap buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted file:** The attacker needs to provide the malformed OpenEXR file to a user or application that uses the vulnerable OpenEXR library. No specific position or capability is required beyond this.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was initially reported as a crash in the `exrheader` tool, but the underlying vulnerability is in the OpenEXR library itself.
- The fix is in commit `8b5370c688a7362673c3a5256d93695617a4cd9a`, which changes the part number check from `partNumber > static_cast<int>(parts.size())` to `partNumber >= static_cast<int>(parts.size())`.
