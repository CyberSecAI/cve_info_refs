- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the SAINT web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Two SQL injection vulnerabilities
    - Two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - SQL injection: A remote authenticated SAINT user could execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    - XSS: A remote attacker who can trick an authenticated SAINT user into clicking on a malicious link could run arbitrary scripts in the security context of the authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL injection: Exploited by a remote authenticated SAINT user through the web interface.
    - XSS: Exploited by tricking an authenticated SAINT user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - SQL injection: Requires a valid account on the SAINT system.
    - XSS: Requires the ability to deliver a malicious link to an authenticated SAINT user and convince them to click it.
