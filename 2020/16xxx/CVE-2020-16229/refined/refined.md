- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PM3 files, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious PM3 file or a malicious web page. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (opening the malicious file or visiting the malicious page).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a malicious PM3 file or lure the target to visit a malicious page. The attacker is remote and does not need any privileges on the target system.
