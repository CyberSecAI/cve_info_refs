- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This occurs in the `BwPFile.exe` when invoked via IOCTL `0x2711`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of Administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
