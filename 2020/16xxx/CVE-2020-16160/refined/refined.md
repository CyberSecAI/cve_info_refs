    "information": "The provided content includes detailed information about CVE-2020-16160. Specifically, the blog post from `blog.inhq.net` directly mentions and describes the vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe root cause of the vulnerability is a division by zero error in the `GPMF_Decompress()` function of the `GPMF_parser.c` file. This occurs because the `GPMF_SizeofType()` function can return zero, which is then used as the divisor in a division operation.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Division by zero vulnerability in the `GPMF_Decompress()` function.\n- The `GPMF_SizeofType()` function can return zero, leading to the division by zero.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Denial of service (DoS) via a crash. The program terminates due to the division by zero error.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted GPMF data stream in a video file that results in `GPMF_SizeofType()` returning zero.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted video file containing malicious GPMF metadata to trigger the vulnerability."
