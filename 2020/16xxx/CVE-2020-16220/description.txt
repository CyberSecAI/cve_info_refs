In Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions C.02, C.03, 
PerformanceBridge Focal Point Version A.01, the product receives input 
that is expected to be well-formed (i.e., to comply with a certain 
syntax) but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input
 complies with the syntax, causing the certificate enrollment service to
 crash. It does not impact monitoring but prevents new devices from 
enrolling.
