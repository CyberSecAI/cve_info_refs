  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-16168",
    "description": "The document outlines an origin validation error in the Robotemi telepresence robot. An altered and potentially malicious app could still access the various cloud resources and user information made available to the temi app because no integrity checks were performed by either the app or the remote servers to ensure that the app had not been modified.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "Lack of integrity checks on the temi phone app.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "No integrity checks are performed on the temi phone app by either the app itself or the remote servers it communicates with, allowing for the use of modified versions."
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can modify the temi phone app without detection, enabling them to perform malicious actions such as intercepting calls, gaining unauthorized access, and controlling the robot.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker modifies the temi phone app using standard Android app modification tools, and then installs the modified app on their Android device. This gives the attacker the ability to perform malicious actions by leveraging the modified app's access to the temi cloud resources.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to modify and install Android applications on their device."
    }
