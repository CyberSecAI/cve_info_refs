Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an incorrect permission assignment in the Microsoft Azure Sphere Linux kernel. Specifically, the `dmesg_restrict` sysctl file is set to 0, allowing unprivileged users to read the kernel message ring buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Unprivileged users can access the kernel message ring buffer via `klogctl`. This buffer can contain sensitive information, such as kernel and userland memory addresses, register contents, and backtraces.
- **Insecure Kernel Configuration:** The `dmesg_restrict` setting is not properly configured for a secure environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including:
    - Kernel memory addresses
    - Userland memory addresses
    - Register contents of crashing applications
    - Kernel code locations
- **Bypassing ASLR:** Leaked information can help bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), potentially enabling further exploitation.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not directly mentioned, the leaked information can be leveraged for more complex attacks.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly triggering a resource leak and OOM killer, an attacker can force the system to log data to the kernel ring buffer that is accessible by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised Application:** An attacker who has compromised an application on the Azure Sphere device can exploit this vulnerability.
- **klogctl function:** The attacker utilizes the `klogctl` function to access the kernel message ring buffer.
- **Resource exhaustion:** The attacker can trigger a resource exhaustion by spawning many processes, causing the OOM killer to activate and leak info.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the Azure Sphere device. This means they need to have compromised an application.
- **Unprivileged Access:** The vulnerability does not require any specific privileges.
- **Ability to use the klogctl syscall:** The attacker needs to be able to call the `klogctl` syscall.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is demonstrated by crashing an application using an out-of-memory condition.
- The attacker can induce a crash by allocating memory repeatedly.
- The vulnerability can be used to obtain the ASLR offset of the `application-manager` process (init process), by using resource exhaustion via spawning child processes which will cause the `application-manager` to log its registers in the kernel ring buffer.
- The exploit involves creating a resource pressure by spawning multiple processes and then reading the kernel log buffer to find the memory addresses.
