Based on the provided content, CVE-2020-16245 is associated with multiple path traversal vulnerabilities in Advantech iView. The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to perform various malicious actions depending on the specific affected method.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of all identified vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths in file operations within different methods of the Advantech iView application. Specifically, the filename parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue (CWE-22). This allows attackers to manipulate the file paths to access or create files outside the intended directories. This vulnerability is present in the following methods:
- `exportTaskMgrReportDetails` in the `TaskMgrTable` class
- `findSummaryUpdateDeviceListExport`, `findCfgDeviceListExport`, `findUpdateDeviceListExport`, and `findSummaryCfgDeviceListExport` methods in the `NetworkServlet` class
- `exportInventoryTable` in the `DeviceTreeTable` class
- `exportPSInventoryTable` in the `PSTable` class
- `exportTaskMgrReport` in the `DeviceTreeTable` class
- `backupDatabase` method of the `NetworkServlet` class

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Several of the methods (`exportTaskMgrReportDetails`, `findSummaryUpdateDeviceListExport`, `findCfgDeviceListExport`, `findUpdateDeviceListExport`, `findSummaryCfgDeviceListExport`, `exportTaskMgrReport`) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** The `exportInventoryTable` and `exportPSInventoryTable` methods can be exploited to create arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `backupDatabase` method can be used to disclose sensitive information, such as stored credentials, and to overwrite arbitrary files.
- **Denial of Service:** Unspecified actions could lead to limited system availability or application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector for all vulnerabilities is remote and requires no authentication. An attacker can send specially crafted requests to the affected methods to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the affected Advantech iView instance. No specific capabilities or prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities. The attacker must send a crafted request that includes a manipulated file path.

**Summary of specific exploits**
- ZDI-20-1087: Remote code execution via `exportTaskMgrReportDetails`
- ZDI-20-1089: Remote code execution via `findSummaryUpdateDeviceListExport`
- ZDI-20-1090: Remote code execution via `findCfgDeviceListExport`
- ZDI-20-1085: Arbitrary file creation via `exportInventoryTable`
- ZDI-20-1092: Remote code execution via `findSummaryCfgDeviceListExport`
- ZDI-20-1091: Remote code execution via `findUpdateDeviceListExport`
- ZDI-20-1086: Arbitrary file creation via `exportPSInventoryTable`
- ZDI-20-1084: Remote code execution via `exportTaskMgrReport`
- ZDI-20-1088: Information disclosure via `backupDatabase`

**Additional notes:**
The advisory also notes that Advantech has released an update (Version 5.7.02) to correct these vulnerabilities.
CISA recommends minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and employing secure remote access methods such as VPNs.
