- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities exist in the SAINT web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - A remote authenticated SAINT user could execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL injection).
    - A remote attacker who can trick an authenticated SAINT user into clicking a malicious link can run arbitrary script in the security context of the authenticated user (XSS).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL Injection: Direct exploitation by a remote authenticated SAINT user.
    - XSS: Requires tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - SQL Injection: Requires an account on the SAINT system.
    - XSS: Requires the ability to deliver a malicious link to an authenticated SAINT user.
