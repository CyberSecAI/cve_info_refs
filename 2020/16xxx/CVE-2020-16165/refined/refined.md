Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `Condition.getPage()` method when processing the `ascs` and `desc` parameters from user requests. These parameters are directly incorporated into the SQL `ORDER BY` clause. The filtering mechanism, `SqlKeyword.filter()`, attempts to remove potentially malicious SQL keywords, but it's easily bypassed using techniques like "double-writing" (e.g., `select` becoming `selselectect`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The core vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the `ORDER BY` clause. Because user-provided parameters `ascs` and `desc` are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that will be executed by the database.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The `SqlKeyword.filter()` method is insufficient to prevent SQL injection. Its simple string replacement approach is easy to circumvent using techniques like "double-writing".
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability is present in pre-authentication APIs, allowing attackers to potentially extract sensitive data like user tokens, password hashes, and other database information without requiring prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can use SQL injection to read arbitrary data from the database, potentially including sensitive user information (usernames, passwords, tokens, etc.).
*   **Account Compromise:** Leaked user tokens and password hashes can be used to compromise user accounts. Attackers can use refresh tokens to obtain valid JWT tickets or directly log in after cracking password hashes.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  While not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL could potentially lead to privilege escalation or other forms of exploitation if database privileges allow.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather information about the database system itself (version, user, etc.) using SQL injection.
*   **Denial of Service:** Although not detailed, SQL injection could potentially be used to craft queries that negatively impact database performance, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious HTTP requests to the affected API endpoint (`/api/blade-log/api/list`).
*   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** Specifically, the `ascs` parameter in the URL is the injection vector. By crafting an `ascs` value containing malicious SQL, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable API endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability is present in a pre-authentication API, so an attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit it.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `SqlKeyword.filter()` method attempts to prevent SQL injection, but its simple string replacement approach (`replaceAll`) is easily bypassed with techniques like double-writing (e.g., using `selselectect` instead of `select`).
*   The `Condition.getPage()` method processes the `ascs` and `desc` parameters for the SQL `ORDER BY` clause.
*   The provided example shows how to leak the database user by using the `ascii` and `substring` functions in the injected SQL.
*   The `/api/blade-log/api/list` endpoint is exposed by default.

In summary, the content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in a pre-auth API, which can be exploited through a manipulated `ascs` parameter. The vulnerability allows attackers to extract sensitive data and potentially compromise user accounts. The lack of proper input sanitization and the easily bypassable filter are the primary weaknesses.
