Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-16119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a double-free issue within the DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) module of the Linux kernel.
*   When a DCCP socket object is cloned using `dccp_create_openreq_child()`, its attributes, including pointers to `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` and `dccps_hc_rx_ccid`, are copied to the child socket object.
*   However, no reference counting is implemented for these `ccid` objects. This results in a situation where both the parent and child socket objects can hold a pointer to the same `ccid` object.
*   If either the parent or child socket closes or disconnects, it can free the `ccid` object which leads to a dangling pointer in the other socket object

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** When one of the socket objects closes, it frees the memory allocated for the `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` object. However, the other socket object retains a dangling pointer to this freed memory. Subsequent access to this pointer will result in use-after-free and potential double-free.
*   **Lack of Reference Counting:** The absence of a reference counter for the `ccid` objects in cloned sockets makes it impossible to properly manage their lifecycle.
*   **Double-Free:**  The use-after-free of the dccps_hc_tx_ccid object leads to a double-free when the other socket attempts to free the same memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a kernel panic (system crash) caused by the double-free.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The dangling pointer is a function pointer and can lead to an arbitrary call if an attacker can control what object occupies the freed memory. This could allow an attacker to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Socket Operations:**
    *   The attacker creates a DCCP socket.
    *   The attacker clones the socket object via `dccp_create_openreq_child()`.
    *   The attacker frees `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` by calling connect(AF_UNSPEC).
    *   The attacker sprays the heap with other allocations.
    *   The attacker closes one of the sockets which can cause a double free when `ccid_hc_tx_exit()` is invoked via the other socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Privileges**: The attacker needs to be able to open and manipulate sockets
*   **Familiarity with DCCP:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to interact with the DCCP sockets to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported by Hadar Manor.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by moving the CCID timers to struct `dccp_sock` and preventing copying of the `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` and `dccps_hc_rx_ccid` during socket cloning by setting them to NULL.
*   The affected code is within `net/dccp/minisocks.c`, `net/dccp/ccids/ccid2.c`, `net/dccp/ccids/ccid3.c` and `net/dccp/proto.c`
*   The fix involves setting `dccps_hc_rx_ccid` and `dccps_hc_tx_ccid` to `NULL` during socket cloning to prevent the dangling pointer.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by calling connect(AF\_UNSPEC) on the socket that shares the `ccid` object, then allocating other objects on the heap, then closing the other socket.
*   The function `ccid_hc_tx_delete` is responsible for freeing the `ccid` object, and if called on a freed object leads to a double free when it calls `ccid->ccid_ops->ccid_hc_tx_exit(sk)`
*   The `ccid` struct contains function pointers that could be manipulated via heap spraying for arbitrary code execution.
