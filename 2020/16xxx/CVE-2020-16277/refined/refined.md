- **Root cause of vulnerability**: SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the SAINT web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - A remote authenticated SAINT user can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    - A remote attacker can trick an authenticated SAINT user into clicking a malicious link, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary scripts within the security context of the authenticated user.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL injection: Exploitable through the web interface.
    - XSS: Exploitable by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - For SQL injection, the attacker needs an account on the SAINT system.
    - For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or button.
