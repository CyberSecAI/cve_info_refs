```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a double-free and out-of-bounds read due to a flaw in the `__azspio_bind` function of the AF_AZSPIO socket implementation within the Microsoft Azure Sphere kernel. The function allows adding the same socket to a list multiple times and then removes it, which leads to a corrupted linked list.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Double-free",
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Memory corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trigger a kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service. With the ability to map a NULL page (through a secondary vulnerability), this could lead to privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating AF_AZSPIO sockets through a high-level application on the Azure Sphere device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the high-level application of an Azure Sphere device. This typically requires having a valid component ID to interact with the AF_AZSPIO socket functionality."
