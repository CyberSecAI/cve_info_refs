Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-16134:

**Root Cause:**
- Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the Sysbus API of Swisscom Internet Boxes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the misconfigured ACLs of the sysbus API.
- This allows an authenticated user with admin credentials or someone with physical access to the reset button to interact with the Sysbus API on the local network.
- Specifically, it enables the creation of a new user and group with elevated privileges, which bypasses intended security controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can create a user with elevated privileges through the sysbus API.
- This user can then enable SSH access via the API.
- Enabling SSH allows an attacker to gain full access to the underlying Linux system of the Internet Box. This constitutes a complete compromise of the device with superuser/root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Network Access:** Exploitation requires the attacker to be on the local network with the vulnerable Internet Box.
- **Physical Access:** Physical access to the device allows an attacker to reset the admin password to gain the necessary level of access.
- **Web Interface access:** Attackers can also use the web interface if they have user-configurable credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to have valid admin credentials for the device's web interface or physical access to reset the admin password.
- **Network proximity:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable Internet Box.
- **API interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the sysbus API, which is accessible on the local LAN.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides specific details regarding the affected devices and firmware versions, which is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
- It clearly outlines the vulnerability, remediation steps (firmware update), and the timeline of the disclosure and patching process.
- The CVSS score is provided: 3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (base score 8.0), highlighting that this is a high-severity vulnerability that is exploitable via adjacent network.
