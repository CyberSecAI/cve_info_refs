Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16159:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `GPMF_ScaledData` function, specifically in how it handles byte-swapping and casting of unsigned scaled data, when operating at the end of the `ms->buffer`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when processing scaled data, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The primary impact is a crash (segmentation fault), leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Information Disclosure: There is a possibility of information disclosure as the out-of-bounds read could expose uninitialized heap memory, but the main observed impact is the crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted GPMF data stream within a media file (e.g., MP4).
- The crafted GPMF data triggers the vulnerable code path in the `GPMF_ScaledData` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious GPMF data stream to the affected software.
- This can be achieved by creating or modifying a video file containing the malicious GPMF data, and having the vulnerable software process it.
- No special privileges or access levels are required beyond the ability to provide an input to the GPMF parser.

**Technical details:**
The vulnerability occurs within `GPMF_parser.c` during the execution of `MACRO_BSWAP_CAST_UNSIGNED_SCALE`. When processing the scaled data, the code reads bytes beyond the allocated buffer, resulting in the heap out-of-bounds read.

The relevant code snippet from `GPMF_parser.c` is:

```
This excerpt highlights the heap-buffer-overflow occurring when `GPMF_ScaledData` is processing data and performs a read past the boundary of the buffer at line 1694 of GPMF_parser.c.

This vulnerability is triggered when `GPMF_ScaledData` attempts to read data of a specific type, at the end of `ms->buffer`, by an input that does not have proper size bounds.

The blog post describing this vulnerability also provides a POC file and indicates that it was assigned CVE-2020-16159.
