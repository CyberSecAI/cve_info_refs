Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-16116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of file paths within archives when extracted by the Ark archive manager. Specifically, the application fails to validate paths, allowing for directory traversal using "../" sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw. By including ".." sequences in the file paths of a specially crafted archive, an attacker can force Ark to write files to locations outside the intended extraction directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations within the user's home directory, which is the typical extraction directory.
- **Code Execution:** By writing malicious files, like a modified `.bashrc` or an executable script within the user's autostart directory, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution when a user logs in or starts a new shell.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can also overwrite critical system files leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a maliciously crafted archive using Ark.
- The malicious archive can be distributed via various methods like email attachments, downloads or other file sharing mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted Archive:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted archive with malicious file paths.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on user interaction to open the archive using the vulnerable version of Ark. No other special privileges are required.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Dominik Penner and reported privately.
- The fix involves using `QDir::cleanPath()` and aborting the extraction process if directory traversal sequences are detected in the archive's filepaths.
- Patches and updates have been released for various distributions including openSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "moderate" severity in most contexts, though some vendors consider it low risk for some of their products due to additional safeguards.
- The vulnerability is referred to as "Zip Slip" in some of the provided content.

In summary, CVE-2020-16116 describes a path traversal vulnerability in the Ark archive manager that allows malicious actors to write files to arbitrary locations within the user's home directory, leading to potential code execution.
