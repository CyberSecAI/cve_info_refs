- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the Enterprise Data Interface (EDI) of Gallagher Command Centre.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the EDI, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker with "Edit Enterprise Data Interfaces" privileges to execute arbitrary SQL commands against a third-party database if EDI is configured to import data from it. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the connected third-party database, as well as potential disruption of services relying on that database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is remote and requires network access to the Command Centre server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have "Edit Enterprise Data Interfaces" privileges within the Gallagher Command Centre application and EDI must be configured to import data from an external database.
