Multiple security issues were discovered in the Chromium web browser, which
could result in the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service
or information disclosure.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 87.0.4280.88-0.4~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium packages.

For the detailed security status of chromium please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/chromium>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
