**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `ErrorMessage` parameter of the `/Auth/Admin` URL within the OLIMPOKS software. This allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability. The injected JavaScript is reflected back in the server's response, executing within the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can steal administrator's cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
    *   **HTML Content Manipulation:** The attacker can alter the HTML content of the application, possibly leading to phishing attacks or defacement.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:**  The ability to manipulate the HTML opens the door to phishing by inserting malicious forms or redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable URL:**  `http://olimpoks.TARGET-HOST:9001/Auth/Admin?ErrorMessage=<malicious_script>`
    *   **Parameter:** The `ErrorMessage` parameter is the injection point.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need local access to the system. They can perform the attack remotely through a network.
    *   **Targeted User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the malicious URL for the injected script to execute.

**Additional details:**
