- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthenticated network access to the Gallagher Command Centre Server allows for the enumeration of access card credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of authentication for network access to enumerate card credentials.
    - Usage of insecure card technologies which can be easily encoded with enumerated credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate access card credentials and use them to encode low-security cards. These cards can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated network connection to the Command Centre Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the Command Centre Server.
