Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-16947:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Out-Of-Bounds Read:** A crafted email can trigger a read operation before the start of an allocated buffer when parsing HTML content.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** Reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** Writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can disclose sensitive information through out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user by leveraging the heap-based buffer overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Email:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens or previews a specially crafted email containing malicious HTML content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote since the attack is performed via email.
*   **Crafted Email:** The attacker needs to create a malicious email containing specially crafted HTML content.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires user interaction in that the target must open the malicious email or view it in the preview pane.
