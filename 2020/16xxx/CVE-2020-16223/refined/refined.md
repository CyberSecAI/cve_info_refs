{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer during the parsing of TPE files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious TPE file, either opened locally or via a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted TPE file to the target. User interaction is required as the target must either visit a malicious web page or open the malicious TPE file."
