- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the SAINT web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection allows execution of arbitrary SQL commands. XSS allows execution of arbitrary scripts in the security context of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands or run arbitrary scripts with the privileges of an authenticated SAINT user.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - SQL injection: Requires a valid account on the SAINT system.
    - XSS: Requires tricking an authenticated SAINT user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - SQL injection: Requires an authenticated SAINT user account.
    - XSS: Requires the ability to deliver a malicious link to an authenticated SAINT user.
