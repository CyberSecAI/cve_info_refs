**CVE-2020-16162 Analysis**

While the provided content doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2020-16162, the issues discussed in the GitHub tickets are highly relevant to the security of the RPKI validator and could lead to vulnerabilities if exploited.  Specifically, the issues relate to how the RPKI validator handles CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) and validation.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the RPKI validator's default configuration and its handling of expired or missing CRLs.

1.  **Insecure Default Configuration:** The RPKI validator defaults to `rpki.validator.strict-validation = false`, which allows it to operate in an insecure mode where it does not enforce strict validation rules. This setting is mentioned in issue #232.

2.  **Ignoring Expired CRLs:** The validator doesn't treat an expired CRL as a critical error. Instead, it logs a warning and continues processing associated manifests and objects as if they were valid. This is the core issue described in ticket #162.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** The main weakness is the potential for a replay attack. If an attacker can manipulate or block access to current CRLs and present an old/expired CRL, the validator may not invalidate the associated manifests and objects. This could allow the attacker to inject old or revoked information into the system, affecting BGP route validation.
*   **Compromised Certificate Validation Model:** Ignoring CRL expiration undermines the certificate verification model that RPKI relies on, which expects that expired CRLs invalidate the associated objects.
*   **Lack of Strict Validation:**  The default setting `rpki.validator.strict-validation = false` allows insecure practices by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **BGP Route Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially flip BGP routes from `valid` to `invalid`, causing routing disruptions and network outages by injecting old/revoked information due to the lack of proper validation of the CRLs.
*   **Undermined Trust in RPKI:** By not strictly enforcing CRL validation, the system's trust model is undermined, leading to potentially malicious routes being considered valid.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the connection between the validator and the CRL distribution point, either blocking the CRL download or replacing it with an expired one.
*   **Presentation of Old Data:** An attacker could present the validator with a set of old RPKI data, including an expired CRL, making it appear valid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Control:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the validator and its source of RPKI data (e.g., a MitM position).
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the data being sent to the validator to inject old or revoked CRLs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue tracker specifically mentions that the RPKI data download procedure should assume that it's collecting untrusted data which needs to be verified using the certificate validation model. The current implementation fails to do this.
*   The lack of OSCP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) or other certificate revocation mechanisms in RPKI highlights the crucial role of CRLs, making it more critical to enforce their expiration.
