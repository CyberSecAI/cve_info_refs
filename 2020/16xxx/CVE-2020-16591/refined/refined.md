Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16591:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid read occurs in the `process_symbol_table()` function within the `readelf` utility of GNU Binutils.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `readelf` utility attempts to read data from a memory location that is not valid. This results in a segmentation fault, leading to a crash.
- The vulnerability occurs during processing of symbol tables.
- The fix involves not setting the number of symbols (`num_of_syms`) when reading buckets or chains fails in `get_num_dynamic_syms()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The invalid read causes the `readelf` utility to crash, preventing it from functioning correctly. This can lead to service disruption if the utility is part of a critical system.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a crafted input file to the `readelf` utility. This crafted input manipulates the symbol table structure to cause the invalid read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted file to be processed by the vulnerable `readelf` utility.
- The attacker typically needs local access to execute `readelf` with the crafted input or have the file processed by a vulnerable system.
- The provided NetApp advisory lists a CVSS score indicating user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided bug report from sourceware.org includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) executable that triggers the vulnerability.
- The issue was reported on April 15, 2020, and a fix was committed to the master branch of the binutils-gdb repository shortly after.
- NetApp has identified that multiple of their products incorporate the vulnerable GNU Binutils. Some products are affected, while others are not.
- The NetApp advisory confirms the vulnerability and its DoS impact.
