Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper output escaping in the `view_all_bug_page.php` file when displaying the content of custom text fields used in filters. Specifically, the `print_filter_values_custom_field` function in `core/filter_form_api.php` did not properly sanitize the custom field's content before displaying it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into a custom text field. This malicious HTML is then stored in the system's database. When a user views the issue list page (`view_all_bug_page.php`), the unsanitized HTML is rendered in the user's browser, which can lead to the execution of malicious scripts.
- **HTML Injection:** The lack of HTML escaping allows any user with the ability to create and edit custom field data to inject arbitrary HTML into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** If the Content Security Policy (CSP) settings of the MantisBT instance do not prevent it, the injected HTML can contain malicious JavaScript code, leading to arbitrary code execution in the browser of any user viewing the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal user cookies, leading to session hijacking.
- **Phishing:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to display fake login forms to capture user credentials.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the page's content and display malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Custom Field Input:** The primary attack vector is through a custom text field in a bug report. By manipulating the value of this field to include malicious HTML code, the attacker injects the payload into the MantisBT system.
- **`view_all_bug_page.php`:** The injected payload is displayed on the `view_all_bug_page.php` when the filter is applied and displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create/Edit Custom Field Data:**  The attacker must have the ability to create and/or modify a custom field in the MantisBT instance. This could be a user with sufficient privileges to create/edit bug reports, or an attacker who has already compromised an account with sufficient privileges.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable page:** The attacker needs to know that the custom field is used in a filter and displayed on `view_all_bug_page.php`.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists since the refactoring of the filter display in Mantis 2.1.0.
- The fix involves escaping the custom field's content using the `string_attribute` function before display in the `print_filter_values_custom_field` function in `/core/filter_form_api.php`.
