Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PM3 files within Advantech WebAccess/HMI Designer. Specifically, the software fails to validate the existence of an object before attempting to perform free operations on it, resulting in a double free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Double Free:** The core vulnerability is a double free condition, where memory is released multiple times. This can corrupt memory structures, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software lacks proper input validation when parsing PM3 files. It does not verify the existence of an object before attempting to free it, which enables exploitation with a crafted malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (Advantech WebAccess/HMI Designer).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted PM3 file designed to trigger the double free vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious PM3 file. This is classified as a User interaction being required in the CVSS vector.
*   **File Access:** The attacker needs to deliver or cause the user to download and open the malicious PM3 file using the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess/HMI Designer.
