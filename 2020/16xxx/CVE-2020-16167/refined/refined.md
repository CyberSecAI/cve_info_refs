The provided content relates to CVE-2020-16167.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication and authorization checks when subscribing to MQTT topics within the Robotemi system. Specifically, the temi robot and phone app fail to verify that a client is authorized to subscribe to a specific topic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authentication for MQTT subscriptions:** The system does not validate if a client is allowed to subscribe to topics, allowing malicious clients to subscribe to topics meant for other users or robots.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Call Interception**: An attacker can intercept calls intended for other users by subscribing to their MQTT call invite topic, allowing them to eavesdrop on private conversations.
-   **Information Disclosure**: The attacker can intercept various notifications meant for a different user such as contact additions, online/offline status, or location.
-  **Privilege Escalation**: An attacker can escalate their privileges by publishing a crafted MQTT message that promotes their user to "OWNER", allowing them to remotely control the robot.

**Attack vectors:**
- **MQTT message injection:** By crafting and sending specific MQTT messages, an attacker can subscribe to arbitrary topics and spoof administrative actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the robot or have the ability to interact with the MQTT broker used by the robot.
- **Phone number of a contact:** To intercept calls, the attacker needs the phone number of a user who is a contact of a temi. To gain owner privileges, an attacker needs the phone number of any contact on a target temi robot.
-   **Modified temi app:** The attacker needs to modify the temi phone app to subscribe to the victim's MQTT topic and/or send forged messages.
