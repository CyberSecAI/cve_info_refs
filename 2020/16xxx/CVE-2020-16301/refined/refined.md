Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a global-buffer-overflow vulnerability located in `devices/gdevokii.c` specifically within the `okiibm_print_page1` function at line 109. This is triggered while processing specific print jobs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Global-buffer-overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory space of a global variable. In this case, it's writing beyond the `graphics_modes_9` global variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** As stated in the Ubuntu Security Notice, a specially crafted file can cause Ghostscript to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** Both the Gentoo and Ubuntu security notices mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution. The buffer overflow vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Document:** The primary attack vector is through processing a maliciously crafted PostScript/PDF file. An attacker would need to provide a file that triggers the buffer overflow in the vulnerable `okiibm_print_page1` function.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as processing malicious documents can happen via network services or user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Crafted File:** The attacker must be able to deliver a specially crafted PostScript/PDF file to the vulnerable Ghostscript application. This can occur via multiple methods such as email, web uploads, or other file transfers.
*   **User or Automated System Interaction:** The target must process the attacker's crafted file using a vulnerable Ghostscript version.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report from bugs.ghostscript.com provides detailed technical information, including the ASan output showing the exact location of the buffer overflow, and the steps to reproduce.
*   The fix was committed to the Ghostscript git repository:  <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commit;h=f54414c8b15b2c27d1dcadd92cfe84f6d15f18dc>
*   The Debian LTS advisory indicates that the vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation, besides denial of service.
*   Multiple sources list this CVE along with a large set of other Ghostscript vulnerabilities fixed in the same updates.
