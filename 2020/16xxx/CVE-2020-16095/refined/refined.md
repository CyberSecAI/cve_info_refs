The provided content is related to CVE-2020-16095.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The TYPO3 extension "Kitodo.Presentation" fails to properly encode user input when outputting it in an HTML context, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Additionally, the extension includes a vulnerable version of jQuery (3.4.1), which also contributes to XSS risks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper encoding of user input.
- Inclusion of a vulnerable jQuery library (3.4.1) with known XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit the XSS vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the web application. This can lead to various impacts, including:
- Stealing user session cookies, allowing account hijacking.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Defacing the website.
- Performing actions on behalf of a user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious scripts via user input that is not properly sanitized or encoded, leading to the execution of the script when viewed by other users.
- Exploiting known XSS vulnerabilities in the included vulnerable jQuery library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the extension through user-supplied input.
- No special privileges or positions are required beyond being able to interact with the vulnerable extension on a webpage.
