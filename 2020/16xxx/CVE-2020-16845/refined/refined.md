Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-16845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `ReadUvarint` and `ReadVarint` functions in the `encoding/binary` package of the Go programming language. These functions are designed to read variable-length integers from a byte stream. However, they have a flaw: if the input stream contains an invalid sequence of bytes, the functions could enter an infinite read loop attempting to consume more bytes than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Infinite read loop:** The primary weakness is the potential for `ReadUvarint` and `ReadVarint` to read an unbounded number of bytes when encountering malformed input. This is due to a lack of proper input validation and bounds checking, causing the functions to keep reading even though a valid varint cannot be constructed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite read loop can cause a program to get stuck, leading to a denial-of-service condition as it becomes unresponsive. This can happen when the application processes untrusted data directly from the network.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** In a DoS scenario, the continuous reading may exhaust the system's resources, further exacerbating the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Input:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing specially crafted byte sequences as input to the vulnerable functions. This input could come from various sources, including network connections, files, or other data streams where these functions are used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send crafted input:** An attacker must be able to provide the specifically crafted malformed input. This can be achieved through a network connection or by manipulating data files that the vulnerable application processes.
*   **No specific privilege required**: The vulnerability can be triggered by any user who can send malformed input. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details from Documents:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Go versions `1.13.15` and `1.14.7`.
*   The fix implemented in Go ensures that the functions will always return after consuming a maximum of 10 bytes, even with invalid input.
*   The vulnerability is present in `golang-github-ulikunitz-xz` because it uses a similar vulnerable implementation of `readUvarint`.
*   The vulnerability affects applications that directly read data from the network and assume `ReadUvarint` or `ReadVarint` consumes a bounded number of bytes.
*   The vulnerability is also present in `go1.7`, and `go1.8` where an update fixed the issue.
*   NetApp states that the vulnerability could lead to a DoS condition.
*   Fedora updates indicate that `golang-1.13.15-1.fc31` and `golang-1.14.7-1.fc32` fix this issue.
*   The openSUSE security updates identify affected products and package versions.
*   SUSE mentions the patch to resolve CVE-2020-16845 will ensure that `ReadUvarint` and `ReadVarint` will now always return after consuming a bounded number of bytes (specifically, MaxVarintLen64, which is 10).
