Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-16093:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that LemonLDAP::NG, prior to version 2.0.9, did not enforce X.509 certificate validation by default when connecting to remote LDAP backends using LDAPS. It relied on the default configuration of the `Net::LDAPS` module in Perl, which does not perform certificate verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of explicit certificate verification when establishing LDAPS connections. This allowed connections to be established with servers presenting self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificates, creating a potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure / Impersonation**: An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate communications between LemonLDAP::NG and the LDAP server. If successful, this could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information, such as user credentials, or even impersonate the LDAP server.
- **Bypass of authentication and access control**: If an attacker were able to gain access to the LDAP server, or impersonate it, they could potentially bypass the authentication and access controls that LemonLDAP-NG is supposed to be implementing.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker positioned on the network could intercept the communication between LemonLDAP::NG and the LDAP server. By presenting a malicious certificate, the attacker could establish a connection with LemonLDAP::NG without triggering any warnings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the LemonLDAP::NG server and the LDAP server.
- **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious certificate that the LemonLDAP::NG server will accept without verification.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix involves changing the default behavior to require X.509 validation against the distribution bundle (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`).
- The previous behavior of not verifying certificates can be reverted by running a specific command.
- For session backends using `Apache::Session::LDAP` or `Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP`, corresponding Apache::Session modules also need to be upgraded for a complete fix.
- The vulnerability exists due to insecure defaults in the `Net::LDAPS` module.
