Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16087:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper input sanitization in the Zalo Desktop application (version 19.8.1.0). Specifically, the application uses double quotes to wrap the file path when opening files using PowerShell. PowerShell interprets content within double quotes as expressions rather than literal text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is achieved by crafting a malicious filename that contains an embedded PowerShell expression.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the filename before passing it to PowerShell.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain full control of the target machine. They can download and execute any type of malware such as keyloggers, ransomware or other malicious code.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could steal sensitive data, including personal information, financial data, and intellectual property.
- **Lateral Movement:** Once an attacker gains access to a machine, they can use it as a pivot point to move laterally to other systems within the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File Transfer via Chat:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted file with a malicious name to the victim via the Zalo chat application.
- **User Interaction:** The victim needs to double-click the file in the chat window to trigger the execution of the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Zalo Account:** The attacker must have a Zalo account to send messages and files to the victim.
- **Knowledge of PowerShell Exploitation:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft malicious filenames that leverage PowerShell's ability to execute code embedded within strings.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided blog post goes into great detail on how to weaponize this vulnerability, including encoding commands and using Windows utilities like `mshta.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `regsvr.exe` for remote code execution.
- The blog notes that the vulnerability was promptly fixed by Zalo after being notified.
