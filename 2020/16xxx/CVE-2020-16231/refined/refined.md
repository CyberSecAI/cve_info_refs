Based on the provided document, here's the extracted information regarding CVE-2020-16231:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Bachmann M1 system controllers use weak cryptography to protect device passwords. Specifically, the controllers utilize a password hash with insufficient computational effort (CWE-916).
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Use of weak cryptographic methods for password hashing.
    *   Default security settings (Security Level 0) that are inherently insecure.
*   Insecure protocols like Telnet, FTP, and Console access are available for use.
* **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain access to password hashes when Security Level 0 is in use.
    *   An authenticated remote attacker can gain access to user credentials, even if Security Level 4 is in use.
    *   An unauthenticated person with physical access to the device may also decrypt and utilize password credentials.
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and further attacks on the system.
* **Attack vectors:**
    *   Remote network access (for unauthenticated and authenticated attacks).
    *   Physical access to the device (for password decryption).
*   Exploiting insecure services on the device.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   For remote attacks: Network access to the affected system.
    *   For authenticated remote attacks: Valid user credentials.
    *   For physical attacks: Physical access to the device.
    * No public exploits are known.

**Additional Information:**
*   The document provides detailed information about affected products, including specific M1 hardware controller models.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to specific versions of the software (4.49-P1 and 3.95R-P8).
*   Mitigation measures are provided if updates are not immediately possible, such as using strong usernames and passwords, utilizing external authentication handlers (LDAP, Radius), and restricting physical access to the device.
*   The advisory recommends using Security Level 4, where communication is limited to TLS protected services, and all insecure services are disabled.
