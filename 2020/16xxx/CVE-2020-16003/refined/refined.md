- Remote exploitation: A remote attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted HTML page: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page that triggers the use-after-free condition during printing.
-  Network: The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker does not need local access to the victim's machine, but can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network.
- Ability to craft a malicious HTML page: The attacker needs to create a specifically crafted HTML page.
