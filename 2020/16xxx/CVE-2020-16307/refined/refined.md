Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-16307:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Ghostscript handles certain malformed document files. Specifically, it involves a segmentation fault within the `names_index_ref` function in the `psi/iname.c` file, as indicated by the bug report.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a segmentation fault due to a memory access violation when processing a crafted PostScript file, leading to a crash. This indicates a potential issue with how Ghostscript handles name indexing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the Ghostscript application, rendering it unable to process further files.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed in the provided information, the Debian and Ubuntu security notices mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution. This is a consequence of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted PS/EPS/PDF file with malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious document to a system running a vulnerable version of Ghostscript. This could be through a website, email attachment, or other file sharing means.

**Additional details:**
- The provided bug report ([https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701822](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701822)) shows a crash in `names_index_ref` function at line 296.
- The security advisories mention that multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in the same update.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The fix involves upgrading to Ghostscript version 9.52 or later.
