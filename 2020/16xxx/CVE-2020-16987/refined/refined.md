{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to improper access control when writing to a process's memory via `/proc/thread-self/mem`. Although the `/proc/self/mem` was patched to be read-only, the `/proc/thread-self/mem` file remained writable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite a function in memory with arbitrary shellcode, allowing for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the compromised application.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a compromised application can exploit the writeable `/proc/thread-self/mem` file to overwrite memory of the application's process.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have already compromised an application running on the Azure Sphere device. The attacker then uses ROP gadgets to write shellcode to memory via `/proc/thread-self/mem`."
