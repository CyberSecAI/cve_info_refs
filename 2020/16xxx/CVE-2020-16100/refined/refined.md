Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper shutdown of closed websocket connections in the DCOM websocket thread of Gallagher Command Centre Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The application fails to properly manage the lifecycle of DCOM websocket connections, specifically how they are closed.
*   This leads to a state where the thread handling these connections becomes unstable, rendering the service unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS).
*   The vulnerable service thread crashes, preventing the server from accepting new DCOM websocket (Configuration Client) connections.
*   This likely disrupts the functionality of the Gallagher Command Centre.
*   The vulnerability leads to a high severity impact on availability (A:H), but no impact on confidentiality (C:N) or integrity (I:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated attacker via DCOM websocket connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the Command Centre server and be able to establish a DCOM websocket connection (Port 8905).
*   No authentication or prior access is required, making it trivial to trigger if the vulnerable service is exposed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Gallagher Command Centre.
*   The vendor has released maintenance releases to address this issue.
*   A workaround is provided, which involves configuring the firewall to restrict access to the DCOM websocket port.
