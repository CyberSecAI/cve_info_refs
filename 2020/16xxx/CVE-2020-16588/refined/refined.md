Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16588:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3236-1) explicitly lists CVE-2020-16588 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the `openexr` package update. The advisory mentions multiple security vulnerabilities related to buffer overflows and out-of-bounds reads, which aligns with the general nature of the vulnerability discussed in the github issue. The github issue #493 also indicates the fix for a null pointer dereference in `makePreview.cpp`, which is a crash-inducing bug that could potentially result from malformed data.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in a null pointer dereference within the `generatePreview` function in `makePreview.cpp`. Specifically, the issue arises when the preview image has a dimension of 1 pixel in height or width. The division by `previewWidth -1` or `previewHeight-1` can lead to a division by zero if the width/height is 1, resulting in NaN which could cause other issues. The code was modified to avoid the division by zero and to use 1 instead when the width or height of the preview image is 1.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a null pointer, leading to a crash.
*   **Division by zero (Potential):** The code contains division operations that can lead to division by zero depending on the size of the preview image. This is not a direct crash, but could cause incorrect behavior.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial of service due to the application crashing.  The crash occurs when processing a malformed image file that causes the vulnerable code path to be executed.
*   **Application Crash:** The null pointer dereference directly leads to a segmentation fault, terminating the `exrmakepreview` application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted or malformed image file to the `exrmakepreview` tool. The malicious image is designed to trigger the vulnerable code path during the preview generation process.
*  **Command Line Input:** By invoking `exrmakepreview` with a specially crafted input file the vulnerability can be triggered.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply the `exrmakepreview` application with a malicious image file.
*   **Command Line Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `exrmakepreview` tool on a system with the vulnerable `openexr` library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was applied by changing the division logic when calculating scaling factors for preview generation in `makePreview.cpp`.
*   The github issue #493 provides a concrete example of a crashing input.
*   The Debian LTS advisory indicates that this vulnerability is fixed in version `2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2` of the `openexr` package.
* The github commit provides the exact lines of code that were modified to fix the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-16588 is a vulnerability in `openexr`'s `exrmakepreview` tool that could allow a malicious user to cause a denial of service via a crafted image file. The root cause is a division by zero and subsequent null pointer dereference when generating preview images with specific dimensions.
