In Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions B.02, C.02, C.03, the 
software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes 
user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is then used 
as a webpage and served to other users. Successful exploitation could 
lead to unauthorized access to patient data via a read-only web 
application.
