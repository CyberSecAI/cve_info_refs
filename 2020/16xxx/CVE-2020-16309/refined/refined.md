Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause for CVE-2020-16309 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the general context indicates that it is related to a flaw in handling document files within Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The vulnerability allows for a denial-of-service condition and potentially arbitrary code execution by processing malformed document files. This suggests a flaw in input validation or memory management. The Ghostscript bug tracker entry for bug 701827, which is related to a heap-buffer-overflow, provides more details in that the root cause is related to improper handling of resolution changes during the print page operation. It specifically points to a heap-buffer-overflow at devices/gdevlxm.c:304 in lxm5700m_print_page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted document can cause Ghostscript to crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Potentially, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the system by exploiting the vulnerability. This is more explicit in the bug tracker where a heap-buffer-overflow is reported and confirmed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted PostScript, EPS or PDF files by Ghostscript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious document file to the system where Ghostscript is being used (e.g., via email, web uploads, etc).
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system; the vulnerability is exploited when the system processes the malicious file.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided information groups CVE-2020-16309 with multiple other CVEs, all affecting Ghostscript. This indicates a larger set of vulnerabilities being addressed with the same patch.
*   The bug tracker entry (701827) points to the specific code location of one of these vulnerabilities (heap-buffer-overflow) indicating that at least some of them may be caused by memory corruption issues.

The provided information gives more detail than the placeholder CVE description, specifically the heap-buffer-overflow reported in the bug tracker clarifies the type of vulnerability and its location in the codebase.
