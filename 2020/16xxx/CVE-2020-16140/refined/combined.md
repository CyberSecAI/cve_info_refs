# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2020-16140 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Thembay

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### Thembay

#### Affected Product

##### Greenmart version 2.4.2.

#### CVE

##### CVE-2020-16140

#### Securin ID

##### 2020-CSW-07-1045

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### July 17, 2020

### Description

A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code (JavaScript) to run in a userâs browser while the browser is connected to a trusted web site. The application targets yourÂ users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. XSS payload was executed when the user loads a malicious link generated using the ajax call back in Greenmart autocomplete search.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on the Greenmart theme on WordPress with version 5.4.2.

Issue 01: Reflected cross-site scripting.

1. Install the Greenmart theme on WordPress with version 5.4.2.

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/fig-1(5).png)

***Figure-01**: The view-source of the WordPress application, which confirms the theme is Greenmart.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-02**: Greenmart search functionality***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-03**: The search action related backend ajax call***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-04**: The ajax call to âgreenmart\_**autocomplete\_searchâ action and the response from the server***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-05**: Call-back request parameter with payload and the response from the server.***

2. Click on the following link [http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?callback=–>%27″><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>&action=greenmart\_autocomplete\_search&term=defaultText&\_=1593737670196](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?callback=--%3e%27%22%3e%3csvg/onxxxload=alert(doxxxcument.cookie)%3e&action=greenmart_autocomplete_search&term=defaultText&_=1593737670196)

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-06**: The call-back parameter is vulnerable to Reflected XSS, and itâs getting executed in the user browser context.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure-07**: Wp-config configuration related to protecting XSS.***

### Impact

When the user input from a URL or POST data is reflected on the page without being stored, thus allowing the attacker to inject malicious content. This means that an attacker has to send a crafted malicious URL or post form to the victim to insert the payload.

### Remediations

Download and apply the relevant patches from the vendor:

[https://docs.thembay.com/greenmart](https://docs.thembay.com/greenmart/)/

### Timeline

**July 17, 2020:**Â Reported to Vendor

**July 17, 2020:** Vendor Responded

**July 18, 2020:** Vendor Released Fixed

**July 29, 2020:** CVE Assigned
