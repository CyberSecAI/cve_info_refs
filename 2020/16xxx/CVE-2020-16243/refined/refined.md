Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-16243

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when processing project files in WECON LeviStudioU.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121):** This allows an attacker to overwrite memory on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the application.
*   This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system, sensitive information disclosure or system malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted project file. An attacker would need to convince a user to open the malicious project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious project file that triggers the buffer overflow when opened by a user.
*   The attacker would need to be in a position to deliver/convince the user to open this file on a system running LeviStudioU.
*   The exploit requires user interaction (i.e., the user has to open the crafted project file).

**Additional Information:**
*   The advisory also mentions two other vulnerabilities: an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability (CVE-2020-25186) and a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-25199). However, these are not related to CVE-2020-16243.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   The advisory states that a low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
