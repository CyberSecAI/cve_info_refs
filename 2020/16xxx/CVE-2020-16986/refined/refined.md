The provided content is related to CVE-2020-16986.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation within the Littlefs Quota implementation in Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.06. Specifically, the `littlefs_quota_charge` function incorrectly handles large negative values when truncating files, leading to a bypass of the quota system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `littlefs_quota_charge` function calculates the amount to be charged for file size changes.
- When truncating a file to a very large negative size using the `truncate` syscall, the `info->used_bytes` field is erroneously reset to 0 due to a flawed check, bypassing the quota limit.
- The `littlefs_quota_charge` function does not properly handle the edge case of a very large negative `delta_in_bytes`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the Littlefs quota limitations and fill the `/mnt/config` partition.
- Filling the partition leads to a denial-of-service condition where the system enters an infinite loop in `lfs_dir_traverse` and triggers the system watchdog, resulting in a system reset. The device enters a state where recovery requires full device recovery.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `truncate` syscall, which can be used to change the size of a file to a large negative value.
- Any kernel driver code that modifies the disk can trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to execute syscalls (e.g. `truncate`) on the affected system.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to files in the `/mnt/config` directory.
