# Privilege escalation using vulnerabilities in gdm3 and accountsservice (GHSL-2020-187, GHSL-2020-188, GHSL-2020-202)

Bug #1900314 reported by
[kev](https://launchpad.net/~kbackhouse2000)
on 2020-10-18

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [gdm3 (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gdm3 "Latest release: 47.0-1ubuntu2.24.10.1, uploaded to main on 2024-12-02 23:08:09.836133+00:00 by Marco Trevisan (Treviño) (3v1n0), maintained by Ubuntu Developers (ubuntu-devel-discuss-lists)") | Fix Released | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

Hi,

I have found a couple of vulnerabilities in gdm3 and accountsservice which enable an unprivileged user to create a new account with administrator privileges. I have already reported the individual bugs to the respective packages, but I am creating this issue to bring it to the attention of the Ubuntu security team, since the bugs create quite a bad combination on Ubuntu. The individual bug reports are here:

[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/accountsservice/+bug/1900255](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/accountsservice/%2Bbug/1900255)

<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/issues/642>

The vulnerabilities are very easy to exploit, as you can see in this video:

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bqSSBp_95bKNU4Kmg_BHar8GHs2DuDwB/view?usp=sharing>

The video is only visible to people who have the link. Please be careful who you share it with. Note: this is a newer video than the one that I attached to the bug reports mentioned above. I found some ways to simplify the exploitation steps.

Regards,

Kevin Backhouse

Hi Seth,

Does CVE-2020-16125 apply to the gdm3 bug in general, or just Ubuntu?

There has been no response yet to the bug report that I submitted to GNOME (<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/issues/642>).

Thanks,

Kev

Hi! Have you heard back from the gdm3 developers? I have updates for accountsservice ready, but ideally would like to publish them at the same time as the gdm3 updates.

So it looks like there's a gdm3 fix available now. While the gdm3 fix is available, I would like the details of the issue to remain private until 2020-11-03 so I can prepare updates and properly test them since accountsservice is specifically mentioned in your gdm3 advisory.

Is 2020-11-03 ok with you?

# gdm3 privilege escalation due to unresponsive accounts-daemon (GHSL-2020-202)

# GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report: `GHSL-2020-202`

The [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com) team has identified a potential security vulnerability in [gdm3](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm).

We are committed to working with you to help resolve this issue. In this report you will find everything you need to effectively coordinate a resolution of this issue with the GHSL team.

If at any point you have concerns or questions about this process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at `securitylab@github.com` (please include `GHSL-2020-202` as a reference).

If you are *NOT* the correct point of contact for this report, please let us know!

## Summary

gdm3 can be tricked into launching `gnome-initial-setup`, enabling an unprivileged user to create a new user account for themselves. The new account is a member of the `sudo` group, so this enables the unprivileged user to obtain admin privileges.

The vulnerability in gdm3 is triggered when the accountsservice daemon is unresponsive. I have simultaneously reported a separate denial-of-service vulnerability in accountsservice to Ubuntu. On Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS, I am able to use the vulnerability in accountsservice to trigger the vulnerability in gdm3 and escalate privileges. As far as I know, the vulnerability in accountsservice only exists on Ubuntu. The freedesktop and debian versions of accountsservice do not contain the vulnerable code. However, gdm3 may also be vulnerable on other systems if a different way can be found to block D-Bus communication with the accountsservice daemon.

## Product

gdm3

## Tested Version

* gdm3, version 3.36.3-0ubuntu0.20.04.1
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS
* Tested with accountsservice, version 0.6.55-0ubuntu12~20.04.1

## Details

### Issue 1: gdm3 LPE due to unresponsive accounts-daemon (`GHSL-2020-202`)

[gnome-initial-setup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-initial-setup) is an application that is run on freshly installed systems. It presents a series of dialog boxes to the user, enabling them to create a new account on the machine. The newly created account is an admin account (it is a member of the `sudo` group). gnome-initial-setup is invoked by gdm3 when there are no user accounts on the machine. Therefore, if we can trick gdm3 into thinking that there are no user accounts, then it will launch gnome-initial-setup, enabling us to gain root privileges.

gdm3 uses a D-Bus method call to get the list of existing users from the accountsservice daemon, in [`look_for_existing_users_sync`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/3.36.3/daemon/gdm-display.c#L513):

```
static void
look_for_existing_users_sync (GdmDisplay *self)
{
        GdmDisplayPrivate *priv;
        GError *error = NULL;
        GVariant *call_result;
        GVariant *user_list;

        priv = gdm_display_get_instance_private (self);
        priv->accountsservice_proxy = g_dbus_proxy_new_sync (priv->connection,
                                                             0, NULL,
                                                             "org.freedesktop.Accounts",
                                                             "/org/freedesktop/Accounts",
                                                             "org.freedesktop.Accounts",
                                                             NULL,
                                                             &error);

        if (!priv->accountsservice_proxy) {
                g_warning ("Failed to contact accountsservice: %s", error->message);
                goto out;
        }

        call_result = g_dbus_proxy_call_sync (priv->accountsservice_proxy,
                                              "ListCachedUsers",
                                              NULL,
                                              0,
                                              -1,
                                              NULL,
                                              &error);

        if (!call_result) {
                g_warning ("Failed to list cached users: %s", error->message);
                goto out;
        }

        g_variant_get (call_result, "(@ao)", &user_list);
        priv->have_existing_user_accounts = g_variant_n_children (user_list) > 0;
        g_variant_unref (user_list);
        g_variant_unref (call_result);
out:
        g_clear_error (&error);
}
```

It seems that the value of `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` is false by default, so if the D-Bus method call fails (due to a timeout) then it will remain false. You will see the message "Failed to list cached users" in the system log.

`look_for_existing_users_sync` is called from [`gdm_display_prepare`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/3.36.3/daemon/gdm-display.c#L557):

```
gboolean
gdm_display_prepare (GdmDisplay *self)
{
        GdmDisplayPrivate *priv;
        gboolean ret;

        g_return_val_if_fail (GDM_IS_DISPLAY (self), FALSE);

        priv = gdm_display_get_instance_private (self);

        g_debug ("GdmDisplay: Preparing display: %s", priv->id);

        /* FIXME: we should probably do this in a more global place,
         * asynchronously
         */
        look_for_existing_users_sync (self);

        priv->doing_initial_setup = wants_initial_setup (self);

        g_object_ref (self);
        ret = GDM_DISPLAY_GET_CLASS (self)->prepare (self);
        g_object_unref (self);

        return ret;
}
```

If `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` is false, then `wants_initial_setup` returns true, leading to the invocation of gnome-initial-setup.

I have made a video demonstrating the exploit, which you can see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rpRbXW1PRKMKRcxft3x-9tprjEbHLgOQ/view?usp=sharing). The video is only visible to people who have the link. Please note that the video also includes details of the vulnerability in accountsservice, so please be careful who you share it with.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to local privilege escalation, where an unprivileged user is able to gain root privileges.

#### Remediation

I recommend making the default value of `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` true.

* Tested with accountsservice, version 0.6.55-0ubuntu12~20.04.1

## Details

### Issue 1: gdm3 LPE due to unresponsive accounts-daemon (`GHSL-2020-202`, `CVE-2020-16125`)

[gnome-initial-setup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-initial-setup) is an application that is run on freshly installed systems. It presents a series of dialog boxes to the user, enabling them to create a new account on the machine. The newly created account is an admin account (it is a member of the `sudo` group). gnome-initial-setup is invoked by gdm3 when there are no user accounts on the machine. Therefore, if we can trick gdm3 into thinking that there are no user accounts, then it will launch gnome-initial-setup, enabling us to gain root privileges.

gdm3 uses a D-Bus method call to get the list of existing users from the accountsservice daemon, in [`look_for_existing_users_sync`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/3.36.3/daemon/gdm-display.c#L513):

```
static void
look_for_existing_users_sync (GdmDisplay *self)
{
        GdmDisplayPrivate *priv;
        GError *error = NULL;
        GVariant *call_result;
        GVariant *user_list;

        priv = gdm_display_get_instance_private (self);
        priv->accountsservice_proxy = g_dbus_proxy_new_sync (priv->connection,
                                                             0, NULL,
                                                             "org.freedesktop.Accounts",
                                                             "/org/freedesktop/Accounts",
                                                             "org.freedesktop.Accounts",
                                                             NULL,
                                                             &error);

        if (!priv->accountsservice_proxy) {
                g_warning ("Failed to contact accountsservice: %s", error->message);
                goto out;
        }

        call_result = g_dbus_proxy_call_sync (priv->accountsservice_proxy,
                                              "ListCachedUsers",
                                              NULL,
                                              0,
                                              -1,
                                              NULL,
                                              &error);

        if (!call_result) {
                g_warning ("Failed to list cached users: %s", error->message);
                goto out;
        }

        g_variant_get (call_result, "(@ao)", &user_list);
        priv->have_existing_user_accounts = g_variant_n_children (user_list) > 0;
        g_variant_unref (user_list);
        g_variant_unref (call_result);
out:
        g_clear_error (&error);
}

```

It seems that the value of `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` is false by default, so if the D-Bus method call fails (due to a timeout) then it will remain false. You will see the message “Failed to list cached users” in the system log.

`look_for_existing_users_sync` is called from [`gdm_display_prepare`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/3.36.3/daemon/gdm-display.c#L557):

```
gboolean
gdm_display_prepare (GdmDisplay *self)
{
        GdmDisplayPrivate *priv;
        gboolean ret;

        g_return_val_if_fail (GDM_IS_DISPLAY (self), FALSE);

        priv = gdm_display_get_instance_private (self);

        g_debug ("GdmDisplay: Preparing display: %s", priv->id);

        /* FIXME: we should probably do this in a more global place,
         * asynchronously
         */
        look_for_existing_users_sync (self);

        priv->doing_initial_setup = wants_initial_setup (self);

        g_object_ref (self);
        ret = GDM_DISPLAY_GET_CLASS (self)->prepare (self);
        g_object_unref (self);

        return ret;
}

```

If `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` is false, then `wants_initial_setup` returns true, leading to the invocation of gnome-initial-setup.

#### Impact

This issue may lead to local privilege escalation, where an unprivileged user is able to gain root privileges.

#### Remediation

I recommend making the default value of `priv->have_existing_user_accounts` true.
