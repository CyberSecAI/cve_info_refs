Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16121:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `InstallFiles`, `GetFilesLocal`, and `GetDetailsLocal` methods of the PackageKit D-Bus interface access files before authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Unprivileged users can learn the MIME type of any file on the system by querying PackageKit via its D-Bus interface. This occurs because file access is performed before authorization.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing intended access controls by accessing local files without proper authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can use this vulnerability to discover sensitive information by identifying the MIME type of the files, which implicitly reveals whether a file exists and has readable content. For example, they could determine the existence of sensitive configuration files, private keys, etc.
- The impact is that an attacker can use this to enumerate sensitive files on the filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The vulnerability is exploitable by local unprivileged users via the PackageKit D-Bus interface, making it a local privilege escalation concern.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to interact with the PackageKit D-Bus interface.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability was fixed by hiding the error messages behind a single generic message, which prevents attackers from distinguishing existing files from non-existing ones.
-   The fix was released in `packagekit 1.1.13-2ubuntu1.1`.
-   A patch for this issue was included in the security update: `debian/patches/CVE-2020-16121.patch`
- The vulnerability was originally reported in [Bug #1888887](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/packagekit/+bug/1888887) in Ubuntu's Launchpad.
