Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-16253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The PgHero gem used the `protect_from_forgery` method from Rails, which defaulted to `:null_session`. This setting doesn't prevent CSRF attacks when non-session based authentication methods, like basic authentication, are used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application was susceptible to CSRF attacks due to the inadequate protection against such attacks when non-session based authentication is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent. Specifically, they could:
    - Cancel running queries.
    - Run `EXPLAIN` on queries, potentially causing denial of service.
    - Reset query statistics.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker needs to get an authenticated user to visit a malicious website. This website can then make requests to the PgHero dashboard on behalf of the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and entice a logged in user of pghero to visit it.
- The attacker does not need prior knowledge of valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability, but rather leverages the existing authentication of a user victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 2.6.0 and below of the PgHero gem.
- The fix involves changing `protect_from_forgery` to use `protect_from_forgery with: :exception`, which provides better CSRF protection for non-session based authentication.
- The vulnerability affects the Docker image, Linux packages, and in specific cases, the Ruby gem (when non-session based auth is used).
- Session based authentication methods (such as Devise's default authentication) are not vulnerable.
