- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The "Advanced administration" page of Telmat AccessLog, Git@Box, and Educ@Box devices, specifically the network debugging tools, does not properly sanitize user input before passing it to the system shell.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Command Injection. User-supplied input to the `ping` command (and potentially others like `traceroute`) is directly passed to the shell without proper filtering or sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE) as the `root` user. An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker with valid administrative credentials can access the "Advanced administration" page via the web interface and inject malicious commands via the `host` parameter of the `cmd.php` script when using the `ping` functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid account with access to the administration interface of the Telmat device.
