```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PM3 files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. The attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious PM3 file or visiting a malicious page, requiring user interaction.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PM3 file or a malicious page that would trigger the vulnerability. The user must interact with the malicious file/page for exploitation to occur."
