Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **Improper Check for Certificate Revocation (CWE-299)**. The affected software does not properly verify the revocation status of digital certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The system fails to validate if a certificate is still valid, potentially leading to the use of a compromised certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Integrity Breach:** Unauthorized modification of data.
    *   **Availability Issues:**  Potential disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable devices.
*   The attack has high complexity (AC:H). The attacker would need specific knowledge and skills to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have a privileged network position (PR:H) or have compromised a privileged account on the network.
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is needed to exploit this vulnerability after the initial setup.
*   The scope is unchanged (S:U), meaning the vulnerability will only impact the component itself.
*   The attacker requires adjacent network access.

**Affected Products:**

*   Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions C.02 and C.03
*   PerformanceBridge Focal Point Version A.01
*   IntelliVue patient monitors MX100, MX400-MX550, MX750, MX850, and IntelliVue X3 Versions N and prior.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document also discusses other vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-16212, CVE-2020-16214, CVE-2020-16216, CVE-2020-16218, CVE-2020-16220, CVE-2020-16222, CVE-2020-16224) affecting the same set of products.
*   Mitigations and workarounds are suggested including network segmentation, access control, and timely application of patches.
*   The advisory specifies that the certificate revocation feature for affected products was implemented for PIC iX and Performance Bridge Focal Point in 2023 and will be completed for IntelliVue Patient Monitors in Q3 of 2024.
