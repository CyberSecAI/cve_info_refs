Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-16308:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain document files within Ghostscript. Specifically, a heap-buffer-overflow was identified in `devices/gdevcdj.c:1972` within the `ep_print_image` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A memory safety issue where the program attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause Ghostscript to crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the heap-buffer-overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Document Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted PostScript/PDF files.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by tricking a user or an automated system into processing the malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious document (PS/EPS/PDF) to a system that uses a vulnerable version of Ghostscript.
*   The attacker must induce the targeted system to process the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported in Bugzilla entry 701829, and a proof-of-concept (POC) file was provided.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `af004276fd8f6c305727183c159b83021020f7d6`.

*   Multiple Linux distributions released security updates to address this vulnerability and other related CVEs affecting Ghostscript.
*   The vulnerable function is `ep_print_image` in `devices/gdevcdj.c` on line 1972
