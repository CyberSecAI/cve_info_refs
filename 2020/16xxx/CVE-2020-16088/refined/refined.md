Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-16088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect usage of the `EVP_PKEY_cmp()` function in the `ca_validate_pubkey` function within OpenIKED's `ca.c` file. The `EVP_PKEY_cmp()` function returns 1 if the keys are the same, 0 if different, and -1 if an error occurs. The original code incorrectly interpreted a return value of 0 as a key match.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect return value check:** The code was checking for `!EVP_PKEY_cmp(peerkey, localkey)` which would incorrectly proceed with the authentication even when the keys were different. It should have been checking for inequality: `EVP_PKEY_cmp(peerkey, localkey) != 1`.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the incorrect comparison, an attacker could bypass public key authentication and establish a connection with a different (mismatched) public key.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass public key authentication, potentially impersonating a legitimate user.
- This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities depending on the network's configuration and the attacker's goal.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the IKEv2 key exchange, specifically during public key authentication.
- An attacker would need to initiate an IKEv2 connection and present a public key that would be incorrectly accepted as a match to a legitimate user's key during the authentication phase.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to initiate an IKEv2 connection to the vulnerable OpenIKED instance.
- The attacker would need to have knowledge of a user's identity for which they wish to bypass the authentication, in order to present their own key in place of the user's expected key.
- No specific network position is mentioned, it is assumed the attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable IKE server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found due to a bug report by Michael Scheibel.
- Patches were made available for OpenBSD 6.6 and 6.7 via `syspatch(8)`.
- OpenIKED versions up to and including those in OpenBSD 6.7 were vulnerable.
- This information aligns with the official description of the CVE from the OpenBSD source code commit and the OpenBSD errata notice.
