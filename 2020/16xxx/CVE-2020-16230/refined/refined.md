- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices use wildcards in their Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration, allowing domains to request resources. This permissive cross-domain policy enables an attacker to inject scripts into the CORS configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Permissive Cross-domain Policy with Untrusted Domains (CWE-942).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access and high privileges could inject scripts into the CORS configuration and retrieve limited confidential information through sniffing.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access with high privileges is required. An attacker injects malicious scripts into the device's CORS configuration to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the device and must possess high privileges to modify the CORS configuration.
