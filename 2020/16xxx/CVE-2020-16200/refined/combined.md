ICS Medical Advisory
# Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform

Last RevisedSeptember 17, 2020
Alert CodeICSMA-20-261-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 6.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Philips
* **Equipment:** Clinical Collaboration Platform
* **Vulnerabilities:** Cross-site Request Forgery, Improper Neutralization of Script in Attributes in a Web Page, Protection Mechanism Failure, Algorithm Downgrade, Configuration

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to trick a user into executing unauthorized actions or provide the attacker with identifying information that could be used for subsequent attacks.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Clinical Collaboration Platform, an HMI data management platform, are affected:

* Clinical Collaboration Platform Versions 12.2.1 and prior

**NOTE:** The product is registered as Vue PACS but was re-branded to Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform when Philips acquired Carestream HCIS.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF) CWE-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties required to process the data safely and correctly.

[CVE-2020-14506](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14506) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF SCRIPT IN ATTRIBUTES IN A WEB PAGE CWE-83](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/83.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output used as a webpage that is served to other users.

[CVE-2020-14525](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14525) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.3    [PROTECTION MECHANISM FAILURE CWE-693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)

When an attacker claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves the claim is correct.

[CVE-2020-16198](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-16198) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)).

#### 3.2.4    [SELECTION OF LESS-SECURE ALGORITHM DURING NEGOTIATION ('ALGORITHM DOWNGRADE') CWE-757](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html)

The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an attacker to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

[CVE-2020-16200](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-16200) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.5    [CONFIGURATION CWE-16](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html)

The product exposes a resource to the wrong control sphere, providing unintended actors with inappropriate access to the resource.

[CVE-2020-16247](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-16247) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Philips released the Clinical Collaboration Platform patch 12.2.1.5 in June 2020 for web portals to remediate CWE-352 and CWE-83.

Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform Version 12.2.5 was released in May 2020 to remediate CWE-16, CWE-352, CWE-83, and CWE-693. Philips requires manual intervention to remediate CWE-757.

Users with questions regarding their specific Philips Clinical Collaboration Platform installations and new release eligibility should contact [Philips service support, or regional service support](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions), or call 1-877-328-2808, option 4.

The Philips advisory and the latest security information for Philips products are available at the [Philips product security website](https://www.philips.com/productsecurity).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Implement physical security measures to limit or control access to critical systems.
* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.
* Apply defense-in-depth strategies.
* Disable unnecessary accounts and services.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
