Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16254:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input passed to the `width` and `height` options in the Chartkick Ruby gem. The gem uses `ERB::Util.html_escape` which prevents XSS but does not escape semicolons, allowing for CSS injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSS Injection: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary CSS code by manipulating the `width` or `height` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can set additional CSS properties that can modify the appearance and behavior of the web page. For example, an attacker could set a background image, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web application, specifically through the `width` or `height` options of the `line_chart`, or similar functions within the Chartkick library, which are often controlled by user input or parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input values that are passed to the `width` or `height` options of the Chartkick library. This could be achieved by directly manipulating URL parameters, form data, or other user-controlled data points. User interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Chartkick gem versions 3.3.2 and below.
- The fix was implemented in version 3.4.0, which limits width and height values to alphanumeric characters and %, preventing the injection of arbitrary CSS.
- The CVSS score is 6.1, which is considered Moderate severity.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component).
- The EPSS score is 0.144% (51st percentile).
