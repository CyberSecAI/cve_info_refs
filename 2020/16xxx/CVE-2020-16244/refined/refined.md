The provided content is related to CVE-2020-16244.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a one-way hash without a salt for password storage within GE Digital APM Classic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use of a one-way hash without a salt (CWE-759). This makes it easier to decrypt passwords if the hash is obtained.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can potentially decrypt stored passwords. Combined with the IDOR vulnerability (CVE-2020-16240) which allows retrieval of user account data, including password hashes, this flaw enables a malicious user to obtain and decrypt other users' passwords, gaining full access to their accounts.
- Successful exploitation could allow access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks are possible due to the remote accessibility of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with high privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
