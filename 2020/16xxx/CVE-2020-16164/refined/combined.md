# RIPE NCC Validator by default is insecure #232

## Description

![@job](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153816?u=94daa90cdfb442be3ed7a7b37752a58d58d0efd9&v=4&size=48)[job](https://github.com/job)opened [on Jul 7, 2020](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3/issues/232#issue-652210852)

According to documentation the default operating mode of the RIPE NCC Validator is `rpki.validator.strict-validation = false`, this means that by default the validator operates in an insecure mode which is detrimental to the users of the software.

It is beyond me why I have to open so many tickets to encourage the developers of this software to produce something that is not an immediate and urgent risk to anyone using this software.

# Missing files don't result in a manifest being considered invalid #158

## Description

![@job](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153816?u=94daa90cdfb442be3ed7a7b37752a58d58d0efd9&v=4&size=48)[job](https://github.com/job)opened [on Mar 23, 2020](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/rpki-validator-3/issues/158#issue-586392353)

In a MITM scenario where an attacker intercepts and manipulates the rsync channel (for example strategically withholding certain .roa files from the view of the validator being attacked), the resulting set of VRPs will be incomplete and can cause severe operational issues.

When a manifest is valid (manifest is parsable, CRL exists is valid (also not expired), and manifest is signed with keys not revoked by the CRL), *and* references files which do not exist in the repository at hand, the publication point should be considered compromised.

So in the case of APNIC where an End User (self-hosted) RPKI publication point misses a few .roa files, the validator can proceed to consider all data from all RPs it could reach eligeble for further validation, except any data from the publication point where files were missing.

In other words: if one or a few files are missing from the repository, the repository should be considered 'down', and no attempt should be made to start guessing what can be salvaged and what not.

# Vulnerability in RPKI manifest validation

High

[ties](/ties)
published
GHSA-q76j-58cx-wp5v
Nov 3, 2020

## Package

rpki-validator-3

## Affected versions

< 3.2

## Patched versions

3.2-2020.10.28.23.06

## Description

A vulnerability in RPKI manifest validation exists when objects on the manifest are hidden, or expired objects are replayed. An attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability could prevent new ROAs from being received or selectively hide ROAs, causing routes to become INVALID.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to perform a man in the middle attack on the TLS connection between the validator and an RRDP repository or perform a man in the middle attack against a rsync-only repository.

The update addresses the vulnerability by implementing validation methods from [RFC 6486bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-6486bis/00/) and enabling strict validation by default.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

No known CVE

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
