Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, related to RPKI manifest validation:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how the RPKI validator handles missing or expired objects referenced in a manifest. Specifically, the validator did not treat a manifest as invalid if some of the files it referenced were missing or if expired objects were replayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Manifest Handling:** The validator failed to properly validate the manifest by not considering it invalid when files referenced in the manifest were missing.
*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** The validator was vulnerable to replay attacks, where expired objects could be replayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Prevent New ROAs:** An attacker could prevent the validator from receiving new Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), thus blocking updates to routing information.
*   **Selective ROA Hiding:** The attacker could selectively hide ROAs, causing routes to be incorrectly marked as INVALID. This could lead to routing disruptions, traffic misdirection, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on TLS:** An attacker could intercept and manipulate the TLS connection between the validator and a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) repository that uses the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on rsync:** An attacker could perform a MITM attack against a repository using the rsync protocol. By strategically withholding certain files (like ROA files) or replaying old expired objects, they could manipulate the validator's view of the routing data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the validator and the RPKI repository.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the intercepted traffic to withhold files or replay expired objects.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified vulnerability is fixed in version `3.2-2020.10.28.23.06` by implementing validation methods from RFC 6486bis and enabling strict validation by default.
*   The issue was discovered in the RIPE NCC validator.
*   The related issue #158 highlights the problem of missing files not invalidating a manifest.
*   Issue #232 points out that the validator operates by default in an insecure mode due to `rpki.validator.strict-validation = false`.

The provided information indicates that the vulnerability is related to RPKI manifest validation. The CVE description is not provided, but based on the content, the vulnerability is well explained.
