Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within Acronis Cyber Backup. The application's `make_request_to_ams` function constructs a URI based on a user-controlled `Shard` header value, which is then used in a `urllib.request.urlopen` call. This allows an attacker to make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SSRF:** The application doesn't validate or sanitize the `Shard` header, allowing arbitrary URL construction.
*   **Header Injection:** The application uses the `Shard` header to construct the URL and includes all original request headers, HTTP method, and request body.
*   **Internal Service Exposure:**  Internal services like the Notification Service, which are intended to be accessible only from localhost, are vulnerable to attacks due to the SSRF.
*  **Lack of Authorization:** The `/api/ams/agents` endpoint is accessible without authentication, making it possible for an attacker to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can query internal network resources that are normally not accessible.
*   **Application Logic Abuse:** An attacker can abuse the internal web services to send fully customized emails with attachments, impersonating legitimate system alerts. This can be used for phishing attacks or malware delivery.
*   **Potential for further escalation:** The SSRF could be used as a stepping stone to further compromise other internal systems and services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a specific POST request to the `/api/ams/agents` endpoint on the Acronis Cyber Backup web service running on port 9877.
*   **`Shard` Header Exploitation:** The crafted request includes a malicious `Shard` header, pointing to the internal service which is then accessed via the SSRF vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Acronis Cyber Backup server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication because the target endpoint `/api/ams/agents` can be reached without prior authentication to the Acronis Management Server.
*   **Understanding of Internal Services:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the internal services running on localhost, particularly the Notification Service on port 30572.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content also details the fix implemented by Acronis in `v12.5 Build 16342`. The fix involves validating the `Shard` address by requiring an `Authorization` header with a JWT, which is then validated against the `/api/account_server/tenants/` endpoint.

The content also includes an example of an exploit payload to send emails, showing the full impact of the vulnerability.
