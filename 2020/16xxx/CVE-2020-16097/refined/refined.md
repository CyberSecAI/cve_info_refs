Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to retrieve site keys used for securing MIFARE Plus and DESFire cards via debug ports on T-Series readers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure handling of site keys on T-Series readers.
- Exposure of cryptographic keys through debug ports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Compromise of site keys allows an attacker to potentially:
   - Gain unauthorized access.
   - Clone or create access cards.
   - Manipulate the access control system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to T-Series readers is required to exploit debug ports.
- The attack would involve retrieving the site keys through the debug ports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the T-Series reader.
- The attacker must have the technical capability to interface with the debug ports and extract the keys.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in specific versions of Gallagher Command Centre software (v8.20 prior to vCR8.20.200221b, v8.10 prior to vGR8.10.179, v8.00 prior to vGR8.00.165, v7.90 prior to vGR7.90.165 and v7.80 or earlier).
- The official CVSS score is (CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). This indicates:
    -  **AV:P** (Attack Vector: Physical) - Requires physical access.
    -  **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low) - Attack is relatively easy to perform.
    -  **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None) - No privileges required to exploit.
    -  **UI:N** (User Interaction: None) - No user interaction is required.
    -  **S:C** (Scope: Changed) - A successful attack can impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.
    - **C:H** (Confidentiality: High) - High impact to confidentiality
    - **I:H** (Integrity: High) - High impact to integrity
    - **A:N** (Availability: None) - No impact to availability

- Mitigation involves upgrading the Command Centre software to the specified versions or later, and using site-specific MIFARE DESFire and Plus keys.
- The Key Migration feature in v8.30 is mentioned for rolling keys on DESFire cards.
- Secure disposal of readers is also recommended.
