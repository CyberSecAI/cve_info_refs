# NAME

cpan - easily interact with CPAN from the command line

# SYNOPSIS

```
# with arguments and no switches, installs specified modules
cpan module_name [ module_name ... ]

# with switches, installs modules with extra behavior
cpan [-cfFimtTw] module_name [ module_name ... ]

# use local::lib
cpan -I module_name [ module_name ... ]

# one time mirror override for faster mirrors
cpan -p ...

# with just the dot, install from the distribution in the
# current directory
cpan .

# without arguments, starts CPAN.pm shell
cpan

# without arguments, but some switches
cpan [-ahpruvACDLOPX]
```
# DESCRIPTION

This script provides a command interface (not a shell) to CPAN. At the moment it uses CPAN.pm to do the work, but it is not a one-shot command runner for CPAN.pm.

## Options

-a

Creates a CPAN.pm autobundle with CPAN::Shell->autobundle.

-A module [ module ... ]

Shows the primary maintainers for the specified modules.

-c module

Runs a `make clean` in the specified module's directories.

-C module [ module ... ]

Show the *Changes* files for the specified modules

-D module [ module ... ]

Show the module details. This prints one line for each out-of-date module (meaning, modules locally installed but have newer versions on CPAN). Each line has three columns: module name, local version, and CPAN version.

-f

Force the specified action, when it normally would have failed. Use this to install a module even if its tests fail. When you use this option, -i is not optional for installing a module when you need to force it:

```
% cpan -f -i Module::Foo
```

-F

Turn off CPAN.pm's attempts to lock anything. You should be careful with this since you might end up with multiple scripts trying to muck in the same directory. This isn't so much of a concern if you're loading a special config with `-j`, and that config sets up its own work directories.

-g module [ module ... ]

Downloads to the current directory the latest distribution of the module.

-G module [ module ... ]

UNIMPLEMENTED

Download to the current directory the latest distribution of the modules, unpack each distribution, and create a git repository for each distribution.

If you want this feature, check out Yanick Champoux's `Git::CPAN::Patch` distribution.

-h

Print a help message and exit. When you specify `-h`, it ignores all of the other options and arguments.

-i module [ module ... ]

Install the specified modules. With no other switches, this switch is implied.

-I

Load `local::lib` (think like `-I` for loading lib paths). Too bad `-l` was already taken.

-j Config.pm

Load the file that has the CPAN configuration data. This should have the same format as the standard *CPAN/Config.pm* file, which defines `$CPAN::Config` as an anonymous hash.

-J

Dump the configuration in the same format that CPAN.pm uses. This is useful for checking the configuration as well as using the dump as a starting point for a new, custom configuration.

-l

List all installed modules with their versions

-L author [ author ... ]

List the modules by the specified authors.

-m

Make the specified modules.

-M mirror1,mirror2,...

A comma-separated list of mirrors to use for just this run. The `-P` option can find them for you automatically.

-n

Do a dry run, but don't actually install anything. (unimplemented)

-O

Show the out-of-date modules.

-p

Ping the configured mirrors and print a report

-P

Find the best mirrors you could be using and use them for the current session.

-r

Recompiles dynamically loaded modules with CPAN::Shell->recompile.

-s

Drop in the CPAN.pm shell. This command does this automatically if you don't specify any arguments.

-t module [ module ... ]

Run a `make test` on the specified modules.

-T

Do not test modules. Simply install them.

-u

Upgrade all installed modules. Blindly doing this can really break things, so keep a backup.

-v

Print the script version and CPAN.pm version then exit.

-V

Print detailed information about the cpan client.

-w

UNIMPLEMENTED

Turn on cpan warnings. This checks various things, like directory permissions, and tells you about problems you might have.

-x module [ module ... ]

Find close matches to the named modules that you think you might have mistyped. This requires the optional installation of Text::Levenshtein or Text::Levenshtein::Damerau.

-X

Dump all the namespaces to standard output.

## Examples

```
# print a help message
cpan -h

# print the version numbers
cpan -v

# create an autobundle
cpan -a

# recompile modules
cpan -r

# upgrade all installed modules
cpan -u

# install modules ( sole -i is optional )
cpan -i Netscape::Booksmarks Business::ISBN

# force install modules ( must use -i )
cpan -fi CGI::Minimal URI

# install modules but without testing them
cpan -Ti CGI::Minimal URI
```
## Environment variables

There are several components in CPAN.pm that use environment variables. The build tools, [ExtUtils::MakeMaker](/pod/ExtUtils%3A%3AMakeMaker) and [Module::Build](/pod/Module%3A%3ABuild) use some, while others matter to the levels above them. Some of these are specified by the Perl Toolchain Gang:

Lancaster Consensus: <https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md>

Oslo Consensus: <https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/oslo-consensus.md>

NONINTERACTIVE\_TESTING

Assume no one is paying attention and skips prompts for distributions that do that correctly. `cpan(1)` sets this to `1` unless it already has a value (even if that value is false).

PERL\_MM\_USE\_DEFAULT

Use the default answer for a prompted questions. `cpan(1)` sets this to `1` unless it already has a value (even if that value is false).

CPAN\_OPTS

As with `PERL5OPT`, a string of additional `cpan(1)` options to add to those you specify on the command line.

CPANSCRIPT\_LOGLEVEL

The log level to use, with either the embedded, minimal logger or [Log::Log4perl](/pod/Log%3A%3ALog4perl) if it is installed. Possible values are the same as the `Log::Log4perl` levels: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL`. The default is `INFO`.

GIT\_COMMAND

The path to the `git` binary to use for the Git features. The default is `/usr/local/bin/git`.

# EXIT VALUES

The script exits with zero if it thinks that everything worked, or a positive number if it thinks that something failed. Note, however, that in some cases it has to divine a failure by the output of things it does not control. For now, the exit codes are vague:

```
1	An unknown error

2	The was an external problem

4	There was an internal problem with the script

8	A module failed to install
```
# TO DO

\* one shot configuration values from the command line

# BUGS

\* none noted

# SEE ALSO

Most behaviour, including environment variables and configuration, comes directly from CPAN.pm.

# SOURCE AVAILABILITY

This code is in Github in the CPAN.pm repository:

```
https://github.com/andk/cpanpm
```

The source used to be tracked separately in another GitHub repo, but the canonical source is now in the above repo.

# CREDITS

Japheth Cleaver added the bits to allow a forced install (-f).

Jim Brandt suggest and provided the initial implementation for the up-to-date and Changes features.

Adam Kennedy pointed out that exit() causes problems on Windows where this script ends up with a .bat extension

# Signature Verification Vulnerabilities in CPAN.pm, cpanminus and CPAN::Checksums

23/11/21 â sgo

[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) is a repository of over 200,000 modules for the
Perl programming language. [PAUSE](https://pause.cpan.org/) is the â[Perl
programming] Authors Upload Serverâ.

To install Perl modules from CPAN, users can use the `cpan` client provided by
[CPAN.pm](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN) included in the Perl core,
or the `cpanm` client provided by
[cpanminus](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3Acpanminus).

Both clients have optional support for verifying that `CHECKSUMS` files have a
valid PAUSE PGP signature before checksums are checked and modules are installed.

It was found that `cpan` and `cpanm` are vulnerable to a signature verification
bypass. Additionally, `CPAN::Checksums` (used by PAUSE) does not uniquely
identify packages in the signed `CHECKSUMS` file, enabling a supply chain
attack.

* [CVE-2020-16154] App::cpanminus 1.7044 allows Signature Verification Bypass
* [CVE-2020-16155] CPAN::Checksums 2.12 does not uniquely define signed data.
* [CVE-2020-16156] CPAN 2.28 allows Signature Verification Bypass

For more information see [Addressing CPAN vulnerabilities related to checksums](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2021/11/addressing-cpan-vulnerabilities-related-to-checksums.html) by Neil Bowers.

# Mitigation

Users should ensure that their CPAN client is configured to use a trusted TLS
(https) protected mirror as signature verification can be bypassed, and signed
`CHECKSUMS` cannot be relied upon for security.

# Signature Verification Bypass

[CVE-2020-16154, CVE-2020-16156]

An attacker can prepend checksums for modified packages to the beginning of
`CHECKSUMS` files, before the cleartext PGP headers. This makes the
`Module::Signature::_verify()` checks in both `cpan` and `cpanm` pass.

Without the `sigtext` and `plaintext` arguments to `_verify()`, the `_compare()`
check is bypassed. This results in `_verify()` only checking that valid signed
cleartext is present somewhere in the file.

## Proof of Concept

First, `Module::Signature` needs to be installed. Then prepare a malicious CPAN
mirror containing a modified package.

In this example, we spoofed the popular `Mojolicious` package to illustrate:

```
mkdir -p cpan/{authors,modules}
wget -O cpan/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
wget -O cpan/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz https://cpan.metacpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
wget -O cpan/modules/03modlist.data.gz https://cpan.metacpan.org/modules/03modlist.data.gz
mkdir -p cpan/authors/id/S/SR/SRI
pushd cpan/authors/id/S/SR/SRI
wget -O CHECKSUMS_ORIG https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/S/SR/SRI/CHECKSUMS
module=Mojolicious-8.56
mkdir $module
echo 'print "### INSERT MALICIOUS CODE HERE ###\n";' > $module/Makefile.PL
tar czf $module.tar.gz $module
sha256=$(sha256sum $module.tar.gz | cut -d' ' -f1)
(echo -en "\$chksum = { '$module.tar.gz' => { sha256 => '$sha256'} };\n__END__\n"; cat CHECKSUMS_ORIG) > CHECKSUMS
popd
cd cpan
# Then serve the repo locally on port 8000
busybox httpd -f -p 8000

```
### CPAN.pm

Prepare environment:

* Install the required signature checker extension
* Add http://localhost:8000 to your `urllist`
* enable `check_sigs`.

```
$ cpan Module::Signature
$ cat <<EOF |cpan
o conf check_sigs 1
o conf urllist unshift http://localhost:8000
o conf commit
EOF

```

```
# CPAN::Checksums does not uniquely define signed data

[CVE-2020-16155]

`CPAN::Checksums` generates `CHECKSUMS` recursively for each directory under the
`author/` directory structure, and the file path for the packages in the
manifest doesnât contain an author handle (filenames are only unique per
author).

An attacker with PAUSE access can trick PAUSE into generating a valid
`CHECKSUMS` file for another authors package, allowing a malicious mirror or
network attacker to serve a modified package to a target along with a valid but
malicious `CHECKSUMS` file.

## Proof of Concept

A `CHECKSUMS` file impersonating the already published package
`Acme::Study::Perl 0.0.1` has been generated on `pause.cpan.org` and signed by
the PAUSE PGP key.

## Addressing CPAN vulnerabilities related to checksums

By [Neil Bowers](https://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/)
on November 23, 2021 6:00 PM

This blog post addresses checksum and signature verification vulnerabilities affecting CPAN, the cpan client, and the cpanm client, which were published in a [security advisory](https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities) on 23rd November 2021. If you're not aware of this topic, you might like to start by reading [the advisory](https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities). This post gives a high-level description of the issues, what has been done to address them, what is still left to do, and what you should do. If you have any questions on this, you can add comments here, or email the PAUSE admins (modules at perl dot org).

Before we dig into the details, we'll first give an overview of how the relevant parts of the CPAN ecosystem work.

If you're not interested in the details, skip to the section "What do you need to do?"

TL;DR: make sure your CPAN client uses https and a trusted mirror â such as cpan.org

## How a CPAN module gets from the author to you

An author creates a new module and wants to share it on CPAN. They build a release, and upload the resulting tarball to PAUSE, where it goes into their author directory (my PAUSE id is NEILB and my author directory can be found on CPAN at <https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/N/NE/NEILB>). If the uploader has the relevant indexing permissions, PAUSE will update the CPAN Index. The Index is a big file which lists all modules on CPAN; here's the entry for the "enum" module, which I currently maintain:

````

    enum     1.12      N/NE/NEILB/enum-1.12.tar.gz

````

It says "if you want enum, the latest version is 1.12 and it's found in the tarball enum-1.12.tar.gz at this path in the authors directory.â

PAUSE also generates checksums for all files in author directories. Every directory has a file called CHECKSUMS (here's an example [CHECKSUMS file for user GLASSER](https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/G/GL/GLASSER/CHECKSUMS). After generating a new CHECKSUMS file, PAUSE signs it with GnuPG.

If you want to install a module, you can download the tarball and install it manually, but most people use a *CPAN client*. There are four main CPAN clients ([cpan](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN/view/scripts/cpan), [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/pod/cpanm), [cpm](https://metacpan.org/pod/cpm), and [cpanp](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/view/bin/cpanp)) but we'll describe use of [cpan](https://metacpan.org/dist/CPAN/view/scripts/cpan), which is the client that's bundled with perl itself. To reduce confusion, we'll use "CPAN.pm" to refer to this client (that's [the module](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN) that the cpan script uses).

To install the module, you run:

````

    $ cpan Foo::Bar

````

The client makes sure it has a recent copy of the index, and looks for the module. If it's in the index, the client looks up the associated tarball and downloads it, along with the CHECKSUMS file that's in the author's directory on CPAN. The client generates a checksum for the downloaded file and compares it with the one in the CHECKSUMS file, and if they match, it goes ahead and installs it.

By default CPAN.pm doesn't check that the signature on the file is valid, but you can optionally enable that check as well. Since it's not enabled by default, the vast majority of us haven't been checking for a valid signature.

If you want to know more, you could start with [a blog post on how PAUSE and CPAN work](https://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/04/the-perl-toolchain-pause-and-cpan.html), and read a [CPAN glossary](http://neilb.org/2015/09/05/cpan-glossary.html) which defines the terminology.

## What issues did the advisory identify?

There were three issues identified, each of which has a separate CVE. This is a summary here; read the original advisory for the full story. Here are the CVEs: CVE-2020-16154, CVE-2020-16155, and CVE-2020-16156.

All three issues involve someone setting up a malicious CPAN mirror, and getting people to start using it.

The first issue is that the CHECKSUMS file only included the name of the tarball. For example, here's a snippet from the CHECKSUMS file in my author directory, as they appeared before the changes described below:

````

  'Date-QuarterOfYear-0.04.tar.gz' => {
      'md5' => '8dd1a29e60af035a652aee121ab0919d',
      'md5-ungz' => '85ba26240f1396a147dcc09413a97db4',
      'mtime' => '2021-06-14',
      'sha256' => '1d13f55e5a1e84a7b05ce8cfd1d4cf9d9da80addd8f5f9fc845d2973daa06200',
      'sha256-ungz' => 'b4808c921b994656498ed74fbbba0677ff88d9624dabeabc4ef4f97b0655482f',
      'size' => 10763
  },

````

There's no mention of the path there. Someone could create a malicious version of my module and upload a file with the same name to their PAUSE where it winds up in their author directory. Then they could upload copies of everything else in my author directory to PAUSE, so that their author directory looks the same as mine, except one file has been replaced with their malicious copy. Their author directory will have a CHECKSUMS file which looks the same as the one in my author directory, apart from different hashes for the one modified file. Plus it's been signed by PAUSE. They can set up their own CPAN mirror that swaps their author directory in place of mine, and if anyone downloads this tarball, even with the signing of CHECKSUMS validated, they get the malicious code but it looks like itâs coming from me.

The other two CVEs are for an issue that affects both CPAN.pm and cpanm. These again relate to someone setting up a malicious CPAN mirror. They can generate checksums for a directory and prepend an unsigned version of the checksum data to the CHECKSUMS file. Both CPAN.pm and cpanm will take the unsigned checksum data, ignoring the signed version that's also in the same CHECKSUMS file. It turned out that if you enabled the signature verification checks in CPAN.pm and cpanm, if an unsigned version of the CHECKSUM data has been injected above the signed data, then the clients would happily install the tarball for you anyway.

## Addressing the issues

The first line of protection is to not use untrusted mirrors. In the early days of CPAN, when the internet was slower and more flakey, most of us used a local mirror, so a network of hundreds of CPAN mirrors sprang up. In 2021 they are largely irrelevant. Since 2019, the mirror list was truncated to just www.cpan.org. Most CPAN clients already default to this or to cpan.metacpan.org (which we also consider a trustworthy source).

If an attacker controls your network traffic, then they could inject malicious tarballs and checksums as well. Using https is the easiest thing you can do here.

CPAN.pm has defaulted to use only cpan.org since 2013 and with the truncation of the mirror list in 2019, any newly configured CPAN.pm clients are not vulnerable to a malicious mirror. The latest release of CPAN.pm will use https if at all possible.

PAUSE has been updated so that the CHECKSUMS files now include `cpan_path` for each file, which gives the relative path to the directory for which the checksums were generated. CPAN.pm will fail to validate if the paths donât match so a signed CHECKSUMS file canât be used from a different directory without detection.

CPAN.pm has been updated so that if you have configured it to validate the signature on CHECKSUMS, it will refuse to install a tarball if the associated CHECKSUMS file isn't signed.

## The CPAN clients

In this section we'll summarise how the various CPAN clients work as of 2021-11-23, so you can make an informed decision on whether to continue using your current client, whether to upgrade, reconfigure, or to switch.

### CPAN.pm / cpan 2.29

* It now ignores any previously configured urllist and only uses cpan.org. If you want it to honour the urllist parameter instead, you must set the new pushy\_https parameter to false.
* It will try to use https, including use of curl or wget if the appropriate modules aren't installed. If none of those approaches work, it will fall back on http://www.cpan.org.
* It always looks at the CHECKSUMS file, and if you set `check_sigs` to true, it will require the CHECKSUMS file to have a valid signature.

### cpanm 1.7044

* Defaults to using http://www.cpan.org (but can be configured to use https://www.cpan.org â see below).
* By default it doesn't look at the CHECKSUMS file.
* The `--verify` option tells it to validate the signature and content of the CHECKSUMS file.
* As of 2021-11-23, the latest version of cpanm (1.7044) doesn't address the issues raised, and so will install a distribution with unsigned CHECKSUMS content.

### cpm 0.997007

* This is the most modern client, and as a result was already in good shape.
* By default cpm always uses https and downloads files from MetaCPAN's CPAN mirror, which we consider a trusted source. You can specify your own mirror in the command-line arguments, and even in your cpanfile.
* cpm's goal is speed, and as a result it doesn't look at the CHECKSUMS file, and there's no option to ask it to.

### cpanp (CPANPLUS) 0.9914

* The default mirror is now www.cpan.org
* If the "md5" config option is set to "true", it will check that the checksums match. This defaults to true if Digest::SHA is available; this has been a core module since Perl 5.9.3. \* There is no option to request verification of the signature.
* The default is to not use https, but if you set `prefer_bin` to true, and configure `hosts` for https, then it will use https://www.cpan.org as the source.
* A new version of CPANPLUS (0.9914) has been released which also checks the cpan\_path field, and refuses to install if it doesn't match.

## What do you need to do?

Use only [https://www.cpan.org/](https://www.cpan.org) or [https://cpan.metacpan.org/](https://cpan.metacpan.org). Do not use any other mirror that you have not personally verified is trustworthy.

Hereâs how to configure that in different CPAN clients:

* **CPAN.pm**: preferably upgrade to version 2.29, or configure your existing installation. In the CPAN shell, run the following command: "o conf urllist https://www.cpan.org", followed by "o conf commit" to save that change.
* **cpanm**: set the PERL\_CPANM\_OPT environment variable to ""--from https://www.cpan.org"
* **cpm**: it is already using https://cpan.metacpan.org, so you don't need to do anything. Check you haven't configured it to use a different mirror, and if you have, either update the config to explicitly use https://cpan.metacpan.org, or remove your configuration so it will use the default.
* **CPANPLUS**: set the `prefer_bin` option to true and make sure you've got curl installed. Then set the `hosts` parameter to `{ 'scheme' => 'https', 'path' => '/', 'host' => 'www.cpan.org' }`

If you insist on using an untrusted mirror, configure your CPAN client to verify CHECKSUMS. Hereâs how to do that in different CPAN clients:

* **CPAN.pm**: always verifies the checksums, but with the `check_sigs` option set to true ("o conf check\_sigs true" then "o conf commit"), it will check the signature as well.
* **cpanm**: the --verify option tells it to verify the checksums, so add that to PERL\_CPANM\_OPT.
* **cpm**: doesn't verify the checksums, and there is currently no option to request that.
* **CPANPLUS**: as long as you're using Perl 5.10 or later, it will verify the checksums. There's no option for testing the signature.

## What's left to do?

At the moment CPAN clients can't make https mandatory, because Perl doesn't support https out of the box. We've [raised this on p5p](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2021/11/msg261979.html), and this will hopefully lead to an RFC and support for https in the not-too-distant future.

Fixes are being worked on for cpanm, so unsigned CHECKSUMS will be fatal if you've given --verify, and also to support the cpan\_path key in the CHECKSUMS files.

We're hoping that CPANPLUS will be updated to try and use https by default, as we've done with CPAN.pm.

## Conclusion

The best way to ensure you're downloading the original versions of CPAN releases is to use a trusted CPAN mirror, and only talk to it over https.

If you are aware of any further potential security issues with PAUSE, or the CPAN clients, you can raise them via email to the PAUSE Admins private email list: pause-admin at perl dot org.

## Acknowledgements

Firstly, thank you to Stig Palmquist, who identified these issues, and who has been patient and helpful as they were being addressed.

As ever with Perl, this has been a team effort of volunteers. Thank you to the CPAN client authors and others, who have worked on changes, and in some cases are still working. Thank you to everyone who read drafts of this post, and improved it with their input.

Something seems to be missing between "if" and "configure" in that sentence.

Not sure if it's still the case but at one point cpan (or "perl -MCPAN -e shell") presented all known mirrors in alphanumeric sort ordering, making it trivial to get an untrusted mirror ranked "high" and likely to be selected by naming it appropriately. I always thought it was an accident waiting to happen. So if this is still the case, at least for CPAN.pm, there should be some randomization thrown in or a tier of "official" mirrors.

A while back, I started providing PGP/GPG signatures for all my CPAN and BackPAN releases [here](https://cpan.toby.ink/).

Obviously, this doesn't help with people using the CPAN client to automatically download and install packages, but might be useful if anybody wants to manually ensure they have an untampered version of a particular package.

Thank you very much for the update.

Is it adequate for users of [Mini-CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN%3A%3AMini) to ensure that their `~/.minicpanrc` specifies `remote: https//www.cpan.org/` (or other trusted server)? Assuming that there is no other reason to mistrust the Mini-CPAN repository, of course.

If the mirror is trustworthy and so is the connection to it, does verification of the PAUSE-signed `CHECKSUMS` serve any remaining purpose? What threat not already covered by the use of a trustworthy origin and channel can be averted by signature verification?

As far as I can reason it out, (corrected) signature verification is both useful and important only when using an untrusted mirror and/or untrusted connection (in which case verifying the signature as being signed by the PAUSE private key provides proof that neither the mirror nor any hop on the route has tampered with the bits).

If a malicious person managed to get write access to the filesystem of a trusted mirror, then the PAUSE-signed CHECKSUMS add a safety check to ensure that the files were not tampered with.

A related aside: it would be nice to have CPAN authors register GnuPG keys with PAUSE, and an option to require their distributions be signed by their keys.

Any change to an author's keys or uploads that aren't signed could be flagged.

The various CPAN tools could be modified to check a distribution against the author's keys.

> If a malicious person managed to get write access to the filesystem of a trusted mirror

Indeed â and I had thought of that but dismissed it: I reasoned it would require the filesystem of either of the two trusted mirrors to be exposed in a way that that allows to gain write access to it without gaining shell on the mirror â since (I reasoned) shell access would ultimately expose the private key one way or another, anyway.

But as I went to write down my reasoning for this reply I realised my mistake â the PAUSE private key exists on PAUSE but not the trusted mirrors. The mirrors cannot sign the `CHECKSUMS`.

So the answer to my question is that verifying the signature protects against compromise of a mirror in general, because it proves that the checksums havenât been tampered after leaving PAUSE.

The upshot is that âmake sure your CPAN client uses https and a trusted mirrorâ is not a substitute for (properly patched) signature verification, and in fact is unnecessary given (properly patched) mandatory signature verification. It is merely a partial mitigation for absent or vulnerable signature verification.

Yes â if authors signed their distributions themselves, this would verify the origin of the bits all the way to the source, rather than just up to PAUSE, which would be a worthwhile increase in trust. The only problem is the usual web of trust question: if the point is not to have to trust PAUSE then you canât source authorsâ keys from PAUSE, so where do you get them?

PAUSE signatures means that you trust that this is what was uploaded to PAUSE. But it's possible that a malicious person stole an author's credentials to upload something.

Author signatures means that you trust that the author has approved this code.

There's always the possibility that a malicious person has stolen PAUSE credentials \*and\* an author's key-signing credentials. It's not foolproof.

As an added safety, we could add a scheme for multiple signatures to be added. So another person can review code and submit their signature to PAUSE somehow.

Marginal benefit, I'd say. It's an additional check that you're getting the expected file.

I've heard anecdotally that the checksums once identified a case where an rsync had been interrupted and result in a truncated file.

I have a local mirror which downloads from <https://cpan.org,> so it's trusted. I then mount the mirror using NFS, so the entry in MyConfig.pm for urllist starts with "`file://foo/bar`". Even though I know it's trusted I still get:

Warning: checksum file '/mnt/CPAN/authors/id/G/GB/GBARR/CHECKSUMS' not conforming.

The cksum does not contain the key 'cpan\_path' for 'CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.12.tar.gz'.

Proceed nonetheless? [no]

How can I handle this scenario?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c0)  Marian Rehak    2021-12-23 12:51:33 UTC  ``` It was found that cpan and cpanm are vulnerable to a signature verification bypass. Additionally, CPAN::Checksums (used by PAUSE) does not uniquely identify packages in the signed CHECKSUMS file, enabling a supply chain attack.  Reference:  <https://blog.hackeriet.no/cpan-signature-verification-vulnerabilities/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c1)  Marian Rehak    2021-12-23 12:51:47 UTC  ``` Created perl-CPAN tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2035274](show_bug.cgi?id=2035274 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-16156 perl-CPAN: Bypass of verification of signatures in CHECKSUMS files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2022-01-05 09:13:20 UTC  ``` The report covers two separate methods to bypass verification of signatures stored in CHECKSUMS files:  1) The first problem is an implementation error found in both perl-CPAN / CPAN.pm and perl-App-cpanminus modules.  Those modules did not correctly handle return value of Module::Signature::_verify() and handled CANNOT_VERIFY error return value as equivalent to SIGNATURE_OK return value, i.e. assuming that signature was correctly verified while verification failed or could not have been performed.  In perl-CPAN, this problem was fixed in the following commit applied in version 2.29:  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/b27c51adf0fda25dee84cb72cb2b1bf7d832148c>  2) The second problem is related to the design of the CHECKSUMS file format. The file only contained file names inside of the CPAN author's directory, without indicating in any way which author the CHECKSUMS file is for.  As all CHECKSUMS files get signed by the same PAUSE ([Perl programming] Authors Upload Server) key, a CHECKSUMS file generated for one author could be used in a directory for a different author without clients being able to detect that.  This problem was fixed by extending CHECKSUMS file format to introduce an additional attribute cpan_path that indicates which author directory the CHECKSUMS file is for.  perl-CPAN was enhanced to check this attribute via this commit also applied in version 2.29:  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/bcbf6d608e48d25306ecfd273118b4d6ba1c5df6>  Related [CVE-2020-16155](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-16155) was assigned for the CPAN::Checksums module that is used to generate CHECKSUMS files.  The CVE covers the lack of information to indicate specific CPAN author directory in CHECKSUMS files.  Both of these issues could be exploited by malicious or compromised mirrors if used by users, or a man-in-the-middle attacker in case plain text HTTP connection was used to download packages instead of using encrypted HTTPS.  The exploitation of the second vulnerability additionally requires attacker to have a valid CPAN author account to be able to get malicious CHECKSUMS file to be generated and signed by CPAN / PAUSE.  Therefore, a recommended mitigation is to only configure CPAN clients to download packages from trusted CPAN mirrors (www.cpan.org and cpan.metacpan.org) and always use HTTPS.  Note that both CPAN.pm and cpanminus defaulted to not checking signatures in the CHECKSUMS file unless explicitly configured to do so.  Therefore, this issue was not relevant to users using the default configuration that did not enable signature verification.  Additional details about these issues can be found in the following blog post:  <http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2021/11/addressing-cpan-vulnerabilities-related-to-checksums.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2022-01-05 15:06:19 UTC  ``` Note that the Module::Signature module that is used by both perl-CPAN and perl-App-cpanminus to perform verification of signatures from the CHECKSUMS files is not shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.  It is shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, but is not installed as a dependency when installing perl-CPAN, it is only required by perl-App-cpanminus.  When Module::Signature is not installed, both cpan and cpanm skip signature verification and continue with package installation without verification even when configured to performed verification (using check_sigs configuration option for cpan, or --verify command line option for cpanm).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2022-01-05 20:12:37 UTC  ``` There is another fix needed to properly fix the first attack vector in addition to the commit already linked in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c2) above:  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/46fe910becd5746adca92e18660567c9e8d37eb5> <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/7f9e5e8c52f535c1c13e177595a5ef4710c72058> <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/c03257dbebccd4deeff1987d5efd98113643f717>  These commits are also included in 2.29.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2022-01-10 09:57:25 UTC  ``` The mitigation recommended by upstream is to ensure that users are only using trusted CPAN mirrors (www.cpan.org or cpan.metacpan.org) and always use HTTPS when downloading packages.  If you already have a cpan configured, the list of configured mirrors can be viewed by running the `cpan` command without any argument and entering the following command on the cpan command's prompt:    o conf urllist  Ensure that the URL list only includes trusted mirrors and that https:// scheme is used for all URLs.  A different set of mirrors can be configured using the following commands (these examples show how to configure one or more mirrors, only one of the commands should be used):    o conf urllist <https://www.cpan.org>   o conf urllist <https://www.cpan.org> <https://cpan.metacpan.org>  After changing configuration, the following command must be used to save the configuration:    o conf commit   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2022-01-12 21:27:05 UTC  ``` Two additional small corrective fixes amending fixes linked from [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2035273#c5) above:  <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/7d4d5e32bcd9b75f7bf70a395938a48ca4a06d25> <https://github.com/andk/cpanpm/commit/89b13baf1d46e4fb10023af30ef305efec4fd603>  These are not included in version 2.29.   ``` |  |
