Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-16199

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DPB files within Delta Industrial Automation CNCSoft ScreenEditor.
- The core issue is a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):**  The application fails to validate the size of the input data when parsing DPB files. This allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the application, which can be administrator.
- **Read/Modify Information:** Attackers could potentially read or modify sensitive data.
- **Application Crash:** The application could crash due to the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DPB Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted DPB project files.
- **User Interaction Required:**  User interaction is required because the target must open a malicious DPB file. This may happen if the target opens a malicious page.
- **Local Attack Vector (AV:L):**  The attacker needs to get a malicious DPB file onto the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious DPB file
- The attacker needs to get the user to open this file

**Additional Details:**
- Delta Industrial Automation released an update (version 1.01.26) to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description, explaining the nature of the vulnerability as a stack-based buffer overflow due to missing input validation during DPB file parsing and providing the attack vector as a crafted DPB file.
