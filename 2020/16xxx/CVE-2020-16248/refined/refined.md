Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the functionality of the Prometheus Blackbox Exporter, which allows it to perform network probes to arbitrary targets specified in the `target` parameter of the `/probe` endpoint. This design allows an attacker to trigger requests to internal services, effectively using the exporter as a proxy, which can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is that the Blackbox Exporter can be made to send requests to arbitrary URLs specified by the attacker via the `/probe?target=` parameter. This allows an attacker to probe internal services, even those that are not directly accessible from the outside network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Reconnaissance:** An attacker can use the Blackbox Exporter to scan the internal network, discovering services and applications that would otherwise be hidden.
*   **Detection of Weak Services:** By probing internal services, an attacker can identify those with vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, if the internal services return sensitive information, the attacker could potentially exfiltrate it via the Blackbox Exporter.
*   **Confused Deputy/Privilege Escalation:** The Blackbox Exporter, often running with high privileges (e.g., root for ICMP probes), can be exploited, using it as a "confused deputy", to gain access to resources the attacker would not normally have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based; an attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the Blackbox Exporter's `/probe` endpoint with a malicious `target` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The `target` parameter in the HTTP GET request to `/probe` is manipulated to specify the internal target to be scanned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Blackbox Exporter's HTTP endpoint. This could be from outside the network (if exposed) or within the same network.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must know how to construct an HTTP GET request to interact with the exporter's API.
*   **No Authentication Required:** By default, no authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "DISPUTED" because it stems from the intended functionality of the Blackbox Exporter.
*   The Prometheus team considers it the user's responsibility to protect the Blackbox Exporter from untrusted networks.
*   The maintainers also note that many security scanners produce false positives and that they'd prefer vulnerability reports with analysis rather than just raw reports.

*   **Attack complexity:** Low
*   **Privileges required:** None
*   **User interaction:** None
*   **Scope:** Changed
*   **Confidentiality:** Low
