}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Subject: Voiding CVE-2020-16248

Dear all,

the Prometheus project[1] has received a public "vulnerability"
report[2] against what the reporter called SSRF, but what is the core
functionality of blackbox_exporter[3]: The ability to trigger network
probes over the network to monitor a target's availability. The
reporter stated that CVE-2020-16248 has been assigned. From context,
it seems to be a paid assessment of our software for an unnamed client
which increases motivation to get "results", in particular CVEs for
"zero days" - which are then promptly reported publicly with an
embargoed CVE.

The reporter has not replied to our statement that this behaviour is
core functionality. I could not find out which organization has
reserved CVE-2020-16248 so I decided to send email to this list to
inform the organization, enabling them to update their records.

Sorry for using this list for that purpose, I could not find a less
wrong place to inform the (hopefully) interested parties.

Best,
Richard

**NOTE:** Before we dive into the technical details below, we would like to
emphasize that Prometheus, as a monitoring system, collects and serves
information about the systems it is monitoring. Therefore, the HTTP endpoints
provided by Prometheus components should not be exposed to publicly accessible
networks like the internet (unless you know what you are doing and have taken
appropriate measures). This includes (but is not limited to) the `/metrics`
endpoint of instrumented binaries, the various API endpoints of server
components, and the `/pprof` endpoint of server components implemented in Go.
Furthermore, it is easily possible to overload and ultimately DoS servers with
requests to these endpoints.

Prometheus is a sophisticated system with many components and many integrations
with other systems. It can be deployed in a variety of trusted and untrusted
environments.

This page describes the general security assumptions of Prometheus and the
attack vectors that some configurations may enable.

As with any complex system, it is near certain that bugs will be found, some of
them security-relevant. If you find a *security bug* please report it
privately to the maintainers listed in the MAINTAINERS of the relevant
repository and CC [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e2e2c31333b2a363b2b2d732a3b3f331e39313139323b392c312b2e2d703d3133). We will fix the issue as soon
as possible and coordinate a release date with you. You will be able to choose
if you want public acknowledgement of your effort and if you want to be
mentioned by name.

### Automated security scanners

Special note for security scanner users: Please be mindful with the reports produced.
Most scanners are generic and produce lots of false positives. More and more
reports are being sent to us, and it takes a significant amount of work to go
through all of them and reply with the care you expect. This problem is particularly
bad with Go and NPM dependency scanners.

As a courtesy to us and our time, we would ask you not to submit raw reports.
Instead, please submit them with an analysis outlining which specific results
are applicable to us and why.

Prometheus is maintained by volunteers, not by a company. Therefore, fixing
security issues is done on a best-effort basis. We strive to release security
fixes within 7 days for: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Node Exporter,
Blackbox Exporter, and Pushgateway.

## Prometheus

It is presumed that untrusted users have access to the Prometheus HTTP endpoint
and logs. They have access to all time series information contained in the
database, plus a variety of operational/debugging information.

It is also presumed that only trusted users have the ability to change the
command line, configuration file, rule files and other aspects of the runtime
environment of Prometheus and other components.

Which targets Prometheus scrapes, how often and with what other settings is
determined entirely via the configuration file. The administrator may
decide to use information from service discovery systems, which combined with
relabelling may grant some of this control to anyone who can modify data in
that service discovery system.

Scraped targets may be run by untrusted users. It should not by default be
possible for a target to expose data that impersonates a different target. The
`honor_labels` option removes this protection, as can certain relabelling
setups.

As of Prometheus 2.0, the `--web.enable-admin-api` flag controls access to the
administrative HTTP API which includes functionality such as deleting time
series. This is disabled by default. If enabled, administrative and mutating
functionality will be accessible under the `/api/*/admin/` paths. The
`--web.enable-lifecycle` flag controls HTTP reloads and shutdowns of
Prometheus. This is also disabled by default. If enabled they will be
accessible under the `/-/reload` and `/-/quit` paths.

In Prometheus 1.x, `/-/reload` and using `DELETE` on `/api/v1/series` are
accessible to anyone with access to the HTTP API. The `/-/quit` endpoint is
disabled by default, but can be enabled with the `-web.enable-remote-shutdown`
flag.

The remote read feature allows anyone with HTTP access to send queries to the
remote read endpoint. If for example the PromQL queries were ending up directly
run against a relational database, then anyone with the ability to send queries
to Prometheus (such as via Grafana) can run arbitrary SQL against that
database.

## Alertmanager

Any user with access to the Alertmanager HTTP endpoint has access to its data.
They can create and resolve alerts. They can create, modify and delete
silences.

Where notifications are sent to is determined by the configuration file. With
certain templating setups it is possible for notifications to end up at an
alert-defined destination. For example if notifications use an alert label as
the destination email address, anyone who can send alerts to the Alertmanager
can send notifications to any email address. If the alert-defined destination
is a templatable secret field, anyone with access to either Prometheus or
Alertmanager will be able to view the secrets.

Any secret fields which are templatable are intended for routing notifications
in the above use case. They are not intended as a way for secrets to be
separated out from the configuration files using the template file feature. Any
secrets stored in template files could be exfiltrated by anyone able to
configure receivers in the Alertmanager configuration file. For example in
large setups, each team might have an alertmanager configuration file fragment
which they fully control, that are then combined into the full final
configuration file.

## Pushgateway

Any user with access to the Pushgateway HTTP endpoint can create, modify and
delete the metrics contained within. As the Pushgateway is usually scraped with
`honor_labels` enabled, this means anyone with access to the Pushgateway can
create any time series in Prometheus.

The `--web.enable-admin-api` flag controls access to the
administrative HTTP API, which includes functionality such as wiping all the existing
metric groups. This is disabled by default. If enabled, administrative
functionality will be accessible under the `/api/*/admin/` paths.

## Exporters

Exporters generally only talk to one configured instance with a preset set of
commands/requests, which cannot be expanded via their HTTP endpoint.

There are also exporters such as the SNMP and Blackbox exporters that take
their targets from URL parameters. Thus anyone with HTTP access to these
exporters can make them send requests to arbitrary endpoints. As they also
support client-side authentication, this could lead to a leak of secrets such
as HTTP Basic Auth passwords or SNMP community strings. Challenge-response
authentication mechanisms such as TLS are not affected by this.

## Client Libraries

Client libraries are intended to be included in users' applications.

If using a client-library-provided HTTP handler, it should not be possible for
malicious requests that reach that handler to cause issues beyond those
resulting from additional load and failed scrapes.

## Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption

Prometheus, and most exporters, support TLS. Including authentication of clients
via TLS client certificates. Details on configuring Prometheus are [`here`](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/tls-encryption/).

The Go projects share the same TLS library, based on the
Go [crypto/tls](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls) library.
We default to TLS 1.2 as minimum version. Our policy regarding this is based on
[Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) recommendations, where we strive to
achieve a grade 'A' with a default configuration and correctly provided
certificates, while sticking as closely as possible to the upstream Go defaults.
Achieving that grade provides a balance between perfect security and usability.

TLS will be added to Java exporters in the future.

If you have special TLS needs, like a different cipher suite or older TLS
version, you can tune the minimum TLS version and the ciphers, as long as the
cipher is not [marked as insecure](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#InsecureCipherSuites)
in the [crypto/tls](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls) library. If that still
does not suit you, the current TLS settings enable you to build a secure tunnel
between the servers and reverse proxies with more special requirements.

HTTP Basic Authentication is also supported. Basic Authentication can be
used without TLS, but it will then expose usernames and passwords in cleartext
over the network.

On the server side, basic authentication passwords are stored as hashes with the
[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) algorithm. It is your
responsibility to pick the number of rounds that matches your security
standards. More rounds make brute-force more complicated at the cost of more CPU
power and more time to authenticate the requests.

Various Prometheus components support client-side authentication and
encryption. If TLS client support is offered, there is often also an option
called `insecure_skip_verify` which skips SSL verification.

## API Security

As administrative and mutating endpoints are intended to be accessed via simple
tools such as cURL, there is no built in
[CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) protection as
that would break such use cases. Accordingly when using a reverse proxy, you
may wish to block such paths to prevent CSRF.

For non-mutating endpoints, you may wish to set [CORS
headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol) such as
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in your reverse proxy to prevent
[XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).

If you are composing PromQL queries that include input from untrusted users
(e.g. URL parameters to console templates, or something you built yourself) who
are not meant to be able to run arbitrary PromQL queries make sure any
untrusted input is appropriately escaped to prevent injection attacks. For
example `up{job="<user_input>"}` would become `up{job=""} or
some_metric{zzz=""}` if the `<user_input>` was `"} or some_metric{zzz="`.

For those using Grafana note that [dashboard permissions are not data source
permissions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/permissions/#data-source-permissions),
so do not limit a user's ability to run arbitrary queries in proxy mode.

## Secrets

Non-secret information or fields may be available via the HTTP API and/or logs.

In Prometheus, metadata retrieved from service discovery is not considered
secret. Throughout the Prometheus system, metrics are not considered secret.

Fields containing secrets in configuration files (marked explicitly as such in
the documentation) will not be exposed in logs or via the HTTP API. Secrets
should not be placed in other configuration fields, as it is common for
components to expose their configuration over their HTTP endpoint. It is the
responsibility of the user to protect files on disk from unwanted reads and
writes.

Secrets from other sources used by dependencies (e.g. the `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable as used by EC2 service discovery) may end up exposed due to
code outside of our control or due to functionality that happens to expose
wherever it is stored.

## Denial of Service

There are some mitigations in place for excess load or expensive queries.
However, if too many or too expensive queries/metrics are provided components
will fall over. It is more likely that a component will be accidentally taken
out by a trusted user than by malicious action.

It is the responsibility of the user to ensure they provide components with
sufficient resources including CPU, RAM, disk space, IOPS, file descriptors,
and bandwidth.

It is recommended to monitor all components for failure, and to have them
automatically restart on failure.

## Libraries

This document considers vanilla binaries built from the stock source code.
Information presented here does not apply if you modify Prometheus source code,
or use Prometheus internals (beyond the official client library APIs) in your
own code.

## Build Process

The build pipeline for Prometheus runs on third-party providers to which many
members of the Prometheus development team and the staff of those providers
have access. If you are concerned about the exact provenance of your binaries,
it is recommended to build them yourself rather than relying on the
pre-built binaries provided by the project.

## Prometheus-Community

The repositories under the [Prometheus-Community](https://github.com/prometheus-community)
organization are supported by third-party maintainers.

If you find a *security bug* in the [Prometheus-Community](https://github.com/prometheus-community) organization,
please report it privately to the maintainers listed in the MAINTAINERS of the
relevant repository and CC [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9fefedf0f2faebf7faeaecb2ebfafef2dff8f0f0f8f3faf8edf0eaefecb1fcf0f2).

Some repositories under that organization might have a different security model
than the ones presented in this document. In such a case, please refer to the
documentation of those repositories.

## External audits

* In 2018, [CNCF](https://cncf.io) sponsored an external security audit by
  [cure53](https://cure53.de) which ran from April 2018 to June 2018. For more
  details, please read the [final report of the audit](/assets/downloads/2018-06-11--cure53_security_audit.pdf).
* In 2020, CNCF sponsored a
  [second audit by cure53](/assets/downloads/2020-07-21--cure53_security_audit_node_exporter.pdf)
  of Node Exporter.
* In 2023, CNCF sponsored a
  [software supply chain security assessment of Prometheus](/assets/downloads/2023-04-19--chainguard_supply_chain_assessment.pdf)
  by Chainguard.

 This documentation is [open-source](https://github.com/prometheus/docs#contributing-changes). Please help improve it by filing issues or pull requests.

ICMP and the root user requirement makes blackbox_exporter a good target.

It also looks like a confused deputy to me, which also makes it a
privilege escalation.

Naively, it looks like a feature that provides an attacker
reconnaissance capabilities and allows network enumeration.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Voiding CVE-2020-16248

---

*From*: Richard Hartmann <richih.mailinglist () gmail com>

*Date*: Sat, 8 Aug 2020 10:49:14 +0200

```
Dear all,

the Prometheus project[1] has received a public "vulnerability"
report[2] against what the reporter called SSRF, but what is the core
functionality of blackbox_exporter[3]: The ability to trigger network
probes over the network to monitor a target's availability. The
reporter stated that CVE-2020-16248 has been assigned. From context,
it seems to be a paid assessment of our software for an unnamed client
which increases motivation to get "results", in particular CVEs for
"zero days" - which are then promptly reported publicly with an
embargoed CVE.

The reporter has not replied to our statement that this behaviour is
core functionality. I could not find out which organization has
reserved CVE-2020-16248 so I decided to send email to this list to
inform the organization, enabling them to update their records.

Sorry for using this list for that purpose, I could not find a less
wrong place to inform the (hopefully) interested parties.

Best,
Richard
