<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when NetBIOS over TCP (NBT) Extensions (NetBT) improperly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system.</p>
<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how a NetBT handles objects in memory.</p>
