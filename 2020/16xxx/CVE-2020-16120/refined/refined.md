  "CVE-2020-16120": {
    "Description": "The overlay file system in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permission checks in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass intended restrictions and gain read access to restricted files.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient permission checks in the overlayfs when copying up files, especially when combined with unprivileged user namespaces and FUSE filesystems, leading to a bypass of access restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks during copy-up operations in overlayfs.",
       "Lack of proper validation when opening files in lower layers through ovl_path_open.",
       "Use of dentry_open() which does not perform permission checks."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can bypass intended restrictions and gain unauthorized read access to restricted files. This is achieved by exploiting the lack of permission checks during the copy-up process in overlayfs, especially when used in combination with user namespaces and FUSE filesystems, which allows them to read the content of files that they are not normally permitted to access.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploitation involves a series of steps: creating a user namespace, mounting a FUSE filesystem, mounting shiftfs on the FUSE mount, mounting overlayfs using a restricted path (e.g., /etc) as lowerdir and the shiftfs mount as upperdir and workdir.",
      "Triggering a copy-up by attempting to move a file from the lower layer"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have the ability to create unprivileged user namespaces, mount FUSE filesystems, shiftfs, and overlayfs. This typically requires local access to the target system."
