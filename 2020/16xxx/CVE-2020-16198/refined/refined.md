{
  "CVE-2020-16198": {
    "Root cause": "The software does not sufficiently verify the claimed identity of an attacker.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is adjacent.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be adjacent to the target network. The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction, but requires a high level of complexity to exploit."
