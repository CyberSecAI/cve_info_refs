Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-16252:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the usage of `protect_from_forgery` method in Rails with the default `:null_session` strategy. This strategy is ineffective against CSRF attacks when non-session based authentication methods, like basic authentication, are used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Field Test dashboard.
- The vulnerability exists when using non-session based authentication methods such as basic authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking an authorized user to visit a malicious website which can then perform requests on behalf of the user.
- Specifically, the attacker could change the variant assigned to a user in the Field Test dashboard, potentially manipulating A/B testing results.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network based attack where an attacker tricks an authorized user to visit a malicious site

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious website under their control.
- The attacker needs to know the target system that's running the vulnerable application
- Basic understanding of HTTP request methods to craft the malicious request.

**Additional Information:**
