Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `GPMF_ExpandComplexTYPE()` function of the `GPMF_parser.c` file. The function processes complex type definitions, using brackets `[]` to indicate array lengths within a type string.
- The function calculates the expansion of the complex type string and stores it in a destination buffer (`dst`). However, the loop controlling the writing into `dst` increments the index (`k`) based on a calculated count *inside* the loop, without verifying if the destination buffer limit is exceeded, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `dst` buffer is allocated on the stack.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The function writes past the end of the `dst` buffer due to the unchecked increment of `k`.
- **Unsafe loop condition:** The loop condition `while (i<srcsize && k<*dstsize)` does not protect against the out-of-bounds write, as `k` is not strictly synchronized to `dstsize` within the loop logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If stack canaries are enabled, the out-of-bounds write will be detected, causing the program to terminate, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the program is compiled without stack canaries, the out-of-bounds write may overwrite adjacent data on the stack, potentially enabling an attacker to manipulate the program's control flow and execute arbitrary code. The attacker would need to carefully craft the input to achieve this. The blog post indicates "The changes are constrained by the nature of the out of bounds write, but a carefully crafted input might still leverage this bug to do something interesting on certain systems or architectures."

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious GPMF Data:** An attacker can craft a malicious GPMF data stream, specifically within the complex type definition (TYPE) KLV, to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Input to GPMF parser:** The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted GPMF data is processed by the GPMF parser library, specifically the `GPMF_ExpandComplexTYPE()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide malicious GPMF data:** The attacker must be able to provide a crafted input to the `GPMF_parser` library, likely in the form of a video file with embedded GPMF metadata or a raw GPMF byte stream.
- **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability; the vulnerability resides in a user-space library.

**Additional details from blog.inhq.net:**
- The blog post provides a detailed code snippet of the vulnerable function, showing how the `k` index is incremented without proper boundary checks.
- It also shows the memory before and after exploitation in gdb, highlighting how the stack memory is overwritten.
- The blog post also mentions that the classification of the impact depends on the compiler settings (specifically, presence of stack canaries).
- It references a POC `poc_issue1.mp4` file that triggers the vulnerability.

**In summary, CVE-2020-16158 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `GPMF_ExpandComplexTYPE()` function of the GPMF parser, caused by improper bounds checking during the processing of complex types. It can lead to a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution, depending on compiler settings. The attacker needs to supply crafted GPMF data with specific complex type definitions.**
