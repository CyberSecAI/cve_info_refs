Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-16197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect logic in how Octopus Server validates credentials (accounts/certificates) in multi-tenant environments. Previously, a credential was allowed to access a deployment target if it was applicable to *any* tenant on that target. This allowed credentials intended for one tenant to be used on another tenant's deployment target, if the target happened to be shared.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Tenant Isolation:** The primary weakness is insufficient isolation between tenants. Credentials scoped to one tenant could inadvertently be used to affect another tenant.
*   **Incorrect Authorization Logic:** The "any tenant" authorization check was flawed and did not provide the necessary level of security for multi-tenant environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Tenant Access:** An attacker could potentially leverage a credential scoped to one tenant to access and modify resources within another tenant's environment.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  Changes made to shared resources like Kubernetes clusters could affect multiple tenants, leading to potential data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Compromised Deployments:** An attacker could potentially use a compromised credential to deploy malicious code or make unauthorized changes in another tenant's deployment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Credentials:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a credential (account/certificate) scoped to one tenant.
*   **Shared Deployment Targets:**  The vulnerability can be exploited when deployment targets are shared across multiple tenants.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Credentials:** The attacker needs access to valid credentials within the Octopus Server instance.
*   **Knowledge of Tenant Scope:** The attacker needs to identify deployment targets that are shared across multiple tenants, and be aware of the target's tenant scope and the scope of the credentials they possess.

**Mitigation:**

The fix changed the logic to require that a credential must be applicable to *all* tenants on a deployment target in order to be used.

The suggested mitigation steps are:

1. Change credentials marked as "Exclude from tenanted deployments" to "Include in both tenanted and untenanted deployments."
2. Add any missing tenants to the account/certificate.
3. In cases where credentials should not be shared, provision a new account/certificate for each tenant whose infrastructure is segregated and scope the new account/certificate to just that tenant.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Octopus Server since tenants were introduced (version 3.4).
* The fix is considered a breaking change
* The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
*   The github content references related internal Trello issues for tracking and managing the fix.

This vulnerability allows for a privilege escalation from the perspective of credentials management, which could allow an attacker with access to credentials in one tenant to affect resources in another tenant.
