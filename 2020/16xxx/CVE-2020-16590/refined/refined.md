Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double free error occurring in the `readelf` utility within GNU Binutils. Specifically, it happens in the `process_symbol_table()` function when processing a crafted file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** A memory region is freed twice, leading to memory corruption and potential program crashes. The first free occurs in `get_num_dynamic_syms` and the second free occurs in `process_symbol_table`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the double free vulnerability leads to a crash of the `readelf` utility, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered when `readelf` processes a specially crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious file as input to the `readelf` utility. The attacker needs to have access to the target system, they don't need to be a privileged user, but the user needs to execute the vulnerable readelf binary with the crafted file as input.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Manh-Dung Nguyen.
- The vulnerable version is binutils 2.35 and the specific commit introducing the bug is 10ca4b042d1.
- The issue was resolved with commit c98a4545dc7bf2bcaf1de539c4eb84784680eaa4.
- NetApp's advisory confirms that NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of GNU Binutils are susceptible and that this vulnerability can lead to DoS. The NetApp advisory lists the affected products as NetApp Cloud Backup OST Plug-in and ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility.
