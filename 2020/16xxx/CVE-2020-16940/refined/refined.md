  "CVE-2020-16940": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to delete arbitrary files on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within handling of the local registry hive by the User Profile service. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to delete files in an incorrect location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete files in the context of SYSTEM.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the User Profile service handles local registry hives. Specifically, by creating a junction, an attacker can trick the service into deleting files at an incorrect location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of registry hives",
      "Incorrect file path validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access via malicious code execution.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
