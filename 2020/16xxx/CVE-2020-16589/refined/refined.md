Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16589:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the `Imf_2_3::TileOffsets::operator()` function when writing tile data, specifically in the `ImfTiledOutputFile.cpp` file. This occurs due to a lack of validation of tile coordinates when copying pixels, leading to out-of-bounds write operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow which occurs when writing tile data with invalid coordinates.
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** Writing to memory locations beyond the allocated buffer for tile data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the application due to the heap buffer overflow, which leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted OpenEXR image file:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted OpenEXR image file that contains invalid tile coordinates, leading to a buffer overflow when processed by `exrmakepreview` or other OpenEXR tools/libraries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious OpenEXR image to a vulnerable application that uses the OpenEXR library to process it. This could be via a direct file input or through a web service or other application that uses the library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in `ImfTiledOutputFile.cpp` at line 458 within the `writeTileData` function, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves validating the tile coordinates before accessing the tile data buffer within the `rawTileData` function of `ImfTiledInputFile.cpp`.
- The commit `6bb36714528a9563dd3b92720c5063a1284b86f8` addresses this issue by adding a check using `isValidTile` before accessing the buffer, which prevents out-of-bounds writes.
- The Debian Security Advisory DLA-3236-1 mentions that CVE-2020-16589 is one of multiple security vulnerabilities in OpenEXR that can lead to denial of service through buffer overflows or out-of-bound reads.
