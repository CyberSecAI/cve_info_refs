## Description

Hi,

I found a crash due to a heap buffer overflow bug on exrmakepreview (the latest commit [9410823](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/commit/941082379a49a1aecafe2b9e84f3403314d910a9) on master).

PoC: <https://github.com/strongcourage/PoCs/blob/master/openexr_9410823/PoC_hbo_writeTileData>

Command: exrmakepreview -v $PoC /dev/null

ASAN says:

Debian Bug     : 986796 992703 990450 990899 1014828

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been found in OpenEXR, command-line
tools and a library for the OpenEXR image format. Buffer overflows or
out-of-bound reads could lead to a denial of service (application crash) if
a malformed image file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1-4.1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

For the detailed security status of openexr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openexr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
