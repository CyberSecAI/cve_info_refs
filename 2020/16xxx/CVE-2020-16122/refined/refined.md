Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-16122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the PackageKit's `aptcc` backend incorrectly handling local package installations. The `packagekitd` daemon assumes that packages are inherently trusted. The `aptcc` backend does not explicitly reject local packages as untrusted. Thus, when a user attempts to install a local `.deb` package using `pkcon install-local`, the system triggers the `org.freedesktop.packagekit.package-install` action instead of `org.freedesktop.packagekit.package-install-untrusted`. This bypasses the intended policy that requires administrator authentication for installing untrusted packages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect trust assumption:** `packagekitd` incorrectly assumes that all packages are trusted by default.
-   **Backend trust handling:** The `aptcc` backend fails to properly identify and flag local packages as untrusted, which deviates from how other backends handle trust.
-   **Policy bypass:** The system incorrectly triggers the `package-install` action rather than `package-install-untrusted` action for local packages. This bypasses polkit's intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A standard user can install a malicious local `.deb` package without needing administrator credentials.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As package installation involves executing scripts within the package, successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution as root.
-  **System Compromise**: Installation of malicious packages can lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   Local Access: An attacker needs local access to the target system.
-   Malicious .deb Package: The attacker must prepare a malicious `.deb` package to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   Must have a non-administrative user account on the target system.
-   Must have the ability to transfer a malicious `.deb` package to the target system.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability exists in the `aptcc` backend of PackageKit.
-   The issue is reproducible by using `pkcon install-local <local_package.deb>`.
-   The vulnerability is not limited to the `aptcc` backend, but likely exists in others, although only the `aptcc` backend was fixed in this instance.
-   The fix involves modifying the `aptcc` backend to explicitly mark local `.deb` packages as untrusted, forcing PackageKit to reprompt for authentication using the correct policy action.
-  The fix was backported to several Ubuntu releases.
