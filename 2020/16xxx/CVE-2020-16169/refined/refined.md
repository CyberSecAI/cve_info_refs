  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-16169",
    "description": "The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the temi robot's privilege management mechanism, specifically how the robot processes MQTT messages to assign user roles (CONTACT, OWNER, ADMIN). An attacker can exploit this by publishing a crafted MQTT message to the robot's 'users/<ROBOT_ID>/admin' topic, directly promoting a CONTACT user to an OWNER without proper authentication or authorization. This bypasses the intended REST API authentication process, allowing the attacker to gain control over the robot. The attacker needs to add themselves to the robot's contact list to gain OWNER privileges but this is easily achievable with the 'SyncContacts' method using a crafted message, or by simply calling the robot, which would add the caller to the contacts automatically.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the temi robot's reliance on MQTT messages for privilege management and its failure to properly authenticate or authorize messages received on the 'users/<ROBOT_ID>/admin' topic. The robot blindly trusts the message contents without verifying the sender's identity or permissions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication Bypass",
      "Improper Access Control",
       "Lack of MQTT message integrity checks",
       "Blind trust of message contents",
        "Insecure Direct Object Reference (accessing other user's device via their client ID)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation grants the attacker the same level of control over the robot as an authorized OWNER, including the ability to remotely operate the robot, access its camera and microphone feeds, and navigate the robot. This can lead to severe privacy breaches and potential misuse of the robot in sensitive environments.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network communication via MQTT",
      "Directly publishing messages to a specific MQTT topic",
       "Modifying the client application to send crafted MQTT messages",
       "Exploiting lack of authentication on MQTT messages"
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to modify the temi phone app or write an application that can publish MQTT messages",
        "Knowledge of a valid temi's MQTT client ID",
         "Possession of at least one phone number registered with the temi application or the MD5 hash of it",
        "Ability to connect to the same network as the robot or have access to the internet connection of the broker"
    ]
