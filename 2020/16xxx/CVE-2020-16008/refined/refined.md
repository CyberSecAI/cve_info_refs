Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-16008:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **stack buffer overflow** within the **WebRTC** component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** This occurs when data written to a buffer exceeds its allocated size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory on the stack. This can lead to various issues, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact of successful exploitation is the potential for **arbitrary code execution**. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker could potentially overwrite return addresses or other critical data on the stack, leading to control of the program flow and thus the ability to run attacker-controlled code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the **WebRTC** component. This indicates that an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious data that triggers the overflow within the WebRTC implementation when a user interacts with it, likely through a malicious web page or application that utilizes WebRTC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to get a user to load or interact with the malicious content that triggers the vulnerable code path in the WebRTC component, which can be done via a malicious website or through other means of delivering malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Tolya Korniltsev on 2020-10-01.
*   The vulnerability is considered high severity.
*   The fix is included in Chromium version 86.0.4240.183 and later.
*   Red Hat has issued RHSA-2020:4974 to address the vulnerability
