```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `application-manager` in Microsoft Azure Sphere does not enforce uniqueness among UIDs specified in the `/mnt/config/uid_map` file, allowing multiple applications to be assigned the same UID.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation (CWE-20). The `application-manager` does not validate the uniqueness of UIDs in the `uid_map` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a system application to share the same UID as an attacker-controlled application, leading to an expanded attack surface. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the targeted system application's folder and interact with the process, potentially leading to further privilege escalation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Modifying the `/mnt/config/uid_map` file to assign the same UID to multiple applications.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the contents of the `/mnt/config/uid_map` file. It is assumed that the attacker already has control over a user application on the system."
