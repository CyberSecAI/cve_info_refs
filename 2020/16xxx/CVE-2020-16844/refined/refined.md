Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-16844

**Root Cause:**
Incorrect translation of wildcard suffixes in Istio Authorization Policies for TCP services. When a `DENY` action is used with wildcard suffixes (e.g., `*-some-suffix`) for source principals or namespace fields, Istio incorrectly translates the principal field to an Envoy-level string match, causing it to never deny access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect Envoy configuration generation for wildcard suffix matching in Authorization Policies.
- The generated Envoy string match for wildcard suffixes for principals includes the `spiffe://` prefix which is incorrect.
- The vulnerability exists specifically in `DENY` policies for TCP services when using wildcard suffixes for source principals or namespace fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Callers who should be denied access based on the Authorization Policy can gain access to TCP services.
- This bypass of the intended access control can lead to unauthorized access and potential compromise of the service.
- The vulnerability affects confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending requests to a TCP service where a `DENY` AuthorizationPolicy with wildcard suffixes is configured for principals or namespaces.
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the target TCP service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable TCP service
- The attacker needs to be able to spoof source identity or namespace.
- The attacker may be required to have a low privilege account to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Istio versions 1.5 to 1.5.8 and 1.6 to 1.6.7.
- Prefix and exact matches in `AuthorizationPolicy` are not affected, nor are `ALLOW` actions.
- HTTP services are also not affected by this vulnerability.
- The correct Envoy string match should use a regex like `spiffe://.*/ns/ns1/sa/foo` instead of a suffix match that includes the `spiffe://` prefix.
- Mitigation involves updating to Istio versions 1.5.9 or 1.6.8 or later, or avoiding suffix matching in DENY policies for TCP services.
