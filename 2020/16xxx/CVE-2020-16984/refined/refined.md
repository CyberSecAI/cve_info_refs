{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to set the `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality on a process, which causes the `brk` syscall to allocate memory with execution permissions, bypassing Azure Sphere's memory protection mechanisms.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Access Control (CWE-284): The custom LSM of Azure Sphere only concerns `mmap` and `mprotect` calls and does not catch the `brk` call.",
    "Bypassing Memory Protections: The `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality allows for execution of code from the heap, circumventing the intended memory restrictions where writable memory cannot be executable."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shellcode within the context of a compromised application, allowing them to perform actions such as gaining higher privileges, exfiltrating data, or further compromising the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a compromised application using ROP gadgets to set the `READ_IMPLIES_EXEC` personality, followed by a `brk` syscall (or other heap allocation that triggers `brk`) to allocate executable memory. The shellcode is then written and executed from the newly allocated memory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have already compromised an application running on the Azure Sphere system. From there, they must be able to execute ROP gadgets to modify process personality and call system functions like `brk`."
