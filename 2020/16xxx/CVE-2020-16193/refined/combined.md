xss: Internal Notes

```
This addresses a vulnerability reported by heinhtetaung where Internal Note
contents are not correctly sanitized if errors are returned. This adds
`true` as the second argument to `Format::htmlchars()` so that all content
is sanitized properly. In some cases however we cannot blanket sanitize all
the content as Inline Images, etc. tend to get obfuscated. So in those cases
this adds `Format::sanitize()` to the Internal Notes directly.
