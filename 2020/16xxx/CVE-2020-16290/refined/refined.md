Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-16290:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `bytes_copy_rectangle` function located in `base/gsbitops.c`. The overflow occurs when copying data to a stack buffer. This is triggered by a crafted PDF file leading to an excessive byte count due to wide pages or high resolutions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability when copying a rectangle of bytes using memcpy. The size of the destination buffer is not correctly checked against the data to be copied which leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the Ghostscript process, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The overflow could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. Though, this is not explicitly stated in the bug report.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Crafted PDF File:**  The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file. This file contains parameters that cause the `bytes_copy_rectangle` function to write more data than the allocated stack buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Provide Input File:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to be processed by the vulnerable Ghostscript application. This might occur through various methods like tricking the user into opening the file locally, sending the file through web service, or processing a file from an email attachment.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The exploit can be triggered when the user simply processes the malicious file via a vulnerable Ghostscript application.
