- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker can send a series of specific data packets within a short period, causing a service error on the PLC Ethernet module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). The PLC's Ethernet module does not properly handle a rapid succession of specific data packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the PLC unable to perform its intended function.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack using crafted data packets sent to the PLC's Ethernet module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the PLC and the ability to send crafted data packets. Low skill level to exploit is indicated.
