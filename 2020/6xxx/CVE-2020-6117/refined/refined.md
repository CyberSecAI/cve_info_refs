The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6117.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page of OS4Ed openSIS. Specifically, the parameters `bday`, `bmonth`, `byear`, `fn`, `ln`, and `mn` are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The application suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code via multiple parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, or even denial of service. The CVSSv3 score indicates that the impact is considered to have a low Confidentiality and Integrity impact with no impact to availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page, injecting SQL code into the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application in order to access the vulnerable page and make the malicious request.
