## Description

![@ufo009e](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28886089?v=4&size=48)[ufo009e](https://github.com/ufo009e)opened [on Jan 12, 2020](https://github.com/HashBrownCMS/hashbrown-cms/issues/327#issue-548537289)

editor role user can change admin user's properties including password hash, salt and token.

let's say you have 2 users in db

id name isadmin hash

1111 admin true aaaaaa

2222 editor false bbbbbb

editor user can use the postuser function to change his password. Attacker can use this function to change the id and other parameters. If editor changed the id to 1111 (post body)which belong to admin, then he can send another postuser request (set to 1111 in both post body and url) to overwrite admin's properties (since findone by id 1111 matches first row now) including hash, token and salt, also changed isadmin to false,

```
static postUser(req, res) {
    let id = req.params.id;
    let properties = req.body;

    UserController.authenticate(req.cookies.token, req.params.project)
    .then((user) => {
        let hasScope = user.hasScope(req.params.project, 'users');

        if(user.id == id || hasScope) {
            // If the current user does not have the "users" scope, revert any sensitive properties
            if(!hasScope) {
                properties.scopes = user.scopes;
                properties.isAdmin = false;
            }

            return Promise.resolve();
        }

        return Promise.reject(new Error('User "' + user.name + '" does not have scope "user"'));
    })
    .then(() => {
        HashBrown.Service.UserService.updateUserById(id, properties);  <<<<<< accept id, and password value

```
