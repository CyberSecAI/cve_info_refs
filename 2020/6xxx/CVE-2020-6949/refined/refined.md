Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks in the `postUser` function of the HashBrown CMS. Specifically, an editor-level user can manipulate the request to change another user's properties, including the password hash, salt, and token, by exploiting a flaw in how user IDs are handled during the update process. The server uses the ID from the request parameter to find the user to update, but the ID in the request body to be updated, leading to a situation where an editor can modify an admin user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `postUser` function uses the user ID from the request parameters to find the user and the ID from the request body as the user being updated, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Lack of proper authorization checks:** The `postUser` function checks if the user has the `users` scope to determine whether to revert sensitive properties, but it does not correctly validate if the current user is allowed to modify the user identified by the ID in the body, allowing an editor to change other users information by spoofing the user ID in the request body.
*   **Password reset bypass:** By changing the password hash, salt and token, the attacker can effectively reset any other user's password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An editor-level user can escalate their privileges by modifying an admin user's account, including changing their password and setting the `isAdmin` property to `false`.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain full control of an admin account and therefore, full control over the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Once an admin account is compromised, the attacker can perform any action on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the `postUser` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the "editor" role.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server where the CMS is running.
* The attacker can identify another user's ID through the database.

**Technical Details:**

The `postUser` function uses the following logic:
1. Extracts the user `id` from request parameters and user `properties` from the request body.
2. Authenticates the user by the token in cookies.
3. Checks if the authenticated user has the `users` scope for the given project.
4. If the authenticated user is updating its own record, or has scope `users`, the update is allowed.
5. If the authenticated user does not have the `users` scope, the `isAdmin` property is set to false and the current user scopes are copied to the properties.
6. The `UserService.updateUserById` function is called with the `id` from the URL parameters and the `properties` from the request body, which can contain a different ID.

The vulnerability arises because the ID used to fetch the user to update (from the URL parameter) is different from the ID used in the update operation (from the request body). This allows a lower-privileged user (editor) to specify the ID of a higher-privileged user (admin) in the request body and overwrite their account details.
