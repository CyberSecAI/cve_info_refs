The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6101.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the AMD Radeon DirectX 11 driver (atidxx64.dll) when processing a malformed pixel shader. Specifically, the `DCL_OUTPUT` instruction, which declares a shader-output register, is used to write to an invalid memory address due to an attacker-controlled register number.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the shader output register number.
    - Ability for an attacker to control the destination memory address via the shader bytecode.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. This can occur on a HYPER-V host from a guest through RemoteFX or theoretically from a web browser.
- **Attack Vectors:**
    - Providing a specially crafted pixel shader file.
    - Triggering the vulnerability via HYPER-V RemoteFX from a guest OS to the host.
    - Potentially triggering from web browsers using WebGL and WebAssembly.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted shader file.
    - For HYPER-V, the attacker needs access to a guest OS utilizing RemoteFX. For browsers, the attacker would need to execute malicious code using WebGL or WebAssembly
