The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6120.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization on the `fn` parameter within the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page of OS4Ed openSIS. This allows for direct injection of SQL commands into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89). Specifically, the `fn` parameter is not sanitized before being used in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate SQL queries leading to potential data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. The CVSS score indicates low impact to Confidentiality and Integrity with no impact to Availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the HTTP request.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload in the `fn` parameter.
