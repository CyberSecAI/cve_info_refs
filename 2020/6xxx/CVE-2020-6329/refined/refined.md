  "CVE-2020-6329": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files within the sandbox subprocess. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code at low integrity.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of validating the existence of an object before performing operations on it during the parsing of SKP files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution at low integrity.",
    "attack_vector": "The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious SKP file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. No special privileges are required. User interaction is required."
