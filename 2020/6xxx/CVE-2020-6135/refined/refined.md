- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `stfid` parameter in the `Validator.php` page of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality and integrity impact, and no availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `Validator.php` page with malicious SQL code in the `stfid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need to be authenticated to access the `Validator.php` page.
