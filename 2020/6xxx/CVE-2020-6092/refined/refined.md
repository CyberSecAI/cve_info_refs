The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6092.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow occurs when parsing the `/BBox` property of a `/Pattern` object within a PDF file. Specifically, a large value in the BBox property results in an integer truncation during floating-point to integer conversion, leading to a negative signed integer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer Overflow (CWE-190): The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when processing the bounding box coordinates, which are initially provided as floating-point numbers but converted to integers.
- Heap-based Buffer Overflow: The integer overflow results in a negative loop counter leading to an out-of-bounds write, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By crafting a malicious PDF file with a specific `/Pattern` object, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. This enables the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: The attacker needs to deliver a specially crafted PDF file to the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted PDF file to a user running the vulnerable version of Nitro Pro.
- User Interaction: The victim must open the malicious PDF file for the exploit to trigger.
