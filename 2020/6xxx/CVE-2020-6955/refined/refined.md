Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Lack of input validation on the `filename` parameter within the Cayin SMP-PRO4 Signage Media Player.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the user's browser when they visit the crafted URL. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Credential theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `filename` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted URL to a victim. This could be done through various means like:
    - Social engineering (e.g., sending the link via email or chat)
    - Injecting the link into a website or application the victim visits
    - Other methods of URL delivery.
- The attacker does not need to have any privileged access to the media player itself initially to exploit the reflected XSS.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable endpoint is: `http://<IPAddr>/html/image_preview.html?filename=<payload>`
- The payload injected is executed in the context of the user's browser.
- Example payload: `"%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E"` which translates to `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
