Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/06/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_22.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Monday, June 22, 2020

The stable channel has been updated to 83.0.4103.116 for Windows, Mac, and Linux, which will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [2](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-4-M83) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$TBD][[1092308](https://crbug.com/1092308)] High CVE-2020-6509: Use after free in extensions. Reported by Anonymous on 2020-06-08

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).

A list of all changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/83.0.4103.106..83.0.4103.116?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in switching release channels?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1173187#c0)  Henrik .   2020-06-21 10:46:31 UTC  ``` Steps to reproduce: - start Chromium (freshly updated from the Update repo) - open two tabs - try to drag tab out of tab bar - notice the tab only moves within the tab bar, but does not get it's own window anymore  This used to work fine in the previous version (i.e. 81.0.4044.138-lp151.2.88.1).

Just to verify if it is tied to us using some old system lib or we can trigger it everywhere. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c4)  Dany Marcoux   2020-06-18 13:37:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomáš Chvátal from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c3)) > By chance are you reproducing it on TW too? > Just to verify if it is tied to us using some old system lib or we can > trigger it everywhere.

I'm running it without parameters.  Clearing the cache and cookies does not help. Reverting to chromium-81.0.4044.138-lp151.2.88.1.x86_64 works around the problem.  I'm available for testing and debugging, as usual. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c7)  Tomáš Chvátal   2020-06-19 06:54:11 UTC  ``` Darn this is bit of a pain as I have leap as a vm here only. And neither of the sites actually crash for me in it :(  Fwiw you can enable debugging to see what goes on in file:    /etc/default/chromium  Also since I can't reproduce it it might be tied to GPU rendering so for tryout switch it off in:   chrome://settings/system ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c8)  Tomáš Chvátal   2020-06-19 07:02:19 UTC  ``` Another possible culprit is that I enabled the ozone wayland stuff -> maybe we need to disable that on leap (see the %bcond_without wayland in the spec). ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c9)  Tomáš Chvátal   2020-06-19 07:16:00 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomáš Chvátal from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1173107#c8)) > Another possible culprit is that I enabled the ozone wayland stuff -> maybe > we need to disable that on leap (see the %bcond_without wayland in the spec).

So here my observations regarding chromedriver:  The latest chromedriver provided by Leap 15.1 fails to respond to certain HTTP requests. This affects Selenium tests. Most Selenium commands still work but with the command `sendKeysToElement` the problem is always reproducible.  See <https://progress.opensuse.org/issues/68284> for details. (This is not an openQA issue. The problem merely affects our CI which is using Leap 15.1.)  Last working version of chromedriver/chromium: 81.0.4044.138-lp151.2.88.1  Affected versions as of now: * 83.0.4103.97-lp151.2.96.1 * 83.0.4103.106-lp151.2.101.1  Note that Tumbleweed's version 83.0.4103.97-1.1 is *not* affected. So it is likely a bug which only occurs in combination with a certain version of a dependency.  I have only spotted this issue when running openQA's tests.
