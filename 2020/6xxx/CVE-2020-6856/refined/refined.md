Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the processing of XML input by the JOC Cockpit application. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. This occurs because the XML parser processes external entities defined in the XML document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application parses XML documents.
- The XML parser is not configured to prevent the processing of external entities.
- The system identifier portion of the entity is vulnerable to tainted data.
- The application allows processing of DTD and external entities

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially disclose sensitive information accessible to the JOC Cockpit daemon's runtime OS account by exploiting the XXE vulnerability. This could include local files, potentially containing passwords or private user data.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability can be used to perform requests to other internal systems.
- **Port Scanning:** Possible to perform port scans from the server hosting the vulnerable service.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If an external resource is targeted that does not stop returning data, it can cause resource exhaustion and impact availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by including a malicious XML document that includes external entity declarations
- The attacker must have a valid account in the JOC Cockpit application with specific privileges to access the vulnerable views.
- An attacker crafts a malicious XML document, including a DOCTYPE element with an external entity that references a local or remote resource. When the application parses this XML, the parser fetches the specified resource, potentially disclosing data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the JOC Cockpit application with privileges to perform specific actions which exposes the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted XML input to the application.
