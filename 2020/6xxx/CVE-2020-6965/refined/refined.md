- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software update mechanism allows an authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files through a crafted update package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type (CWE-434)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could upload arbitrary files on the system. This could lead to various consequences including arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data breaches, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, by exploiting the software update mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user is required to exploit this vulnerability through the software update mechanism. The attacker must have network access to the device.
