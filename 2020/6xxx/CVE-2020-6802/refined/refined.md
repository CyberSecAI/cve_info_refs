Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2020-6802 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a parsing discrepancy between the `bleach` library (specifically, how it utilizes `html5lib`) and web browsers when handling the `<noscript>` tag. When a `noscript` tag is present, the `bleach` library parses its content as HTML, while browsers interpret it as raw text or JavaScript if JavaScript is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Mutation XSS (mXSS):** The core weakness is a mutation XSS vulnerability.  The library sanitizes the HTML in a way that does not match how the browser interprets it, causing the sanitized output to become an XSS vector. This occurs when `bleach.clean` is called with specific configurations.
*   **Inconsistent Parsing:** The primary issue is that the bleach library parses the content of the `<noscript>` tag as HTML, while a browser interprets it differently (as raw text when javascript is disabled, and potentially as javascript when enabled).
*   **Whitelisted Tags:** The vulnerability is triggered when `noscript` and at least one of the following "raw text" tags are whitelisted as allowed tags in `bleach.clean()`:  `title`, `textarea`, `script`, `style`, `noembed`, `noframes`, `iframe`, `xmp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential account compromise and other malicious actions.
*   **Data theft:** The malicious JavaScript code can access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information stored by the browser for that site.
*   **Content Manipulation:** The injected script can modify the HTML page's content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Injection:** An attacker injects a specially crafted HTML payload containing a combination of `<noscript>` and a raw text tag, and potentially other HTML elements into an application that uses `bleach` for sanitization.
*   **Whitelisting Bypass:** If the application allows or whitelists `<noscript>` and any of the mentioned raw text tags in the bleach sanitization, then the attacker can bypass the sanitization process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker must be able to inject HTML into an application using `bleach`. This can be via user-generated content, comments, form inputs, or any location where HTML input is processed by the library.
*   **Target Site using Bleach:** The targeted website must use the vulnerable version of bleach and allow specific tags via its whitelist configuration.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of this specific mXSS vulnerability to craft the exploit.

**Technical Details:**
The core of the issue is that the bleach library and browsers handle `<noscript>` tags differently. Bleach sanitizes the contents of `<noscript>` tags as if they were HTML, while browsers render the contents as text/javascript when JavaScript is enabled. This difference can lead to a bypass of sanitization and the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. An exploit example:
```html
<noscript><style></noscript><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

This payload exploits the vulnerability when both `noscript` and `style` are whitelisted in `bleach.clean()`.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Yaniv Nizry from Checkmarx.
*   The fix involved ensuring Bleach parses noscript content as Javascript.
*   A patch was released in `bleach` version 3.1.1 to address this vulnerability.
*  A similar vulnerability using `<svg>` and `<math>` was found and fixed in version 3.1.2 and is tracked as CVE-2020-6816.
