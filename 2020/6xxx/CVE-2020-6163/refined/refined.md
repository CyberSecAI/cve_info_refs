{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WikibaseMediaInfo extension was not properly escaping HTML characters in autocomplete suggestions, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-controlled data within autocomplete suggestions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML code that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a label for a Wikidata item that contains malicious HTML. When a user searches for this item using autocomplete, the malicious HTML would be rendered in the search suggestions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to edit Wikidata items to add a malicious label. The user would have to search for that item in the WikibaseMediaInfo autocomplete feature."
