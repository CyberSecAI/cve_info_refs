Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6353

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the parsing of SKP files by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. Specifically, the software fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where the software attempts to access memory that has been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations, which allows the use-after-free condition to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Low Integrity Context:** The attacker's code executes within the context of the current process with low integrity privileges.
*   **Potential for System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary code, an attacker could potentially compromise the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious SKP file designed to trigger the use-after-free condition.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open the malicious SKP file or visit a malicious page that loads/parses the file.
*   **Local Attack Vector:** The CVSS score indicates a local attack vector (AV:L)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Crafting Malicious SKP File:** The attacker needs the ability to create an SKP file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering/Delivery Mechanism:** The attacker must get the victim to open the file (e.g., through email, shared file locations, etc.)

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vendor Patch:** SAP has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) indicating that it is exploitable locally with user interaction, and has low impacts to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
