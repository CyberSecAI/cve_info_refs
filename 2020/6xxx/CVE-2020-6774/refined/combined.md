## Summary

Several issues have been discovered affecting the Bosch Recording
Station (BRS). The critical issues apply to BRS systems which are
connected to an open network.

Bosch strongly recommends to operate the BRS system in a closed network
and prevent unauthorized direct access to the BRS server.

The product was announced end of life in 2016.

## Affected Products

* Bosch Recording Station

## Solution and Mitigations

### Restricted Physical Access

The hardware access to the system should be heavily restricted and be locked for public.

### Limited User Exposure

The application usage itself should be limited to a trusted user environment and the system logs need to be checked regularly.

### Closed Network

Bosch strongly recommends to operate the BRS in a closed network with
very limited access to the system. The services SMB and RDP should be
deactivated to mitigate the risk for vulnerabilities CVE-2017-0144 and
CVE-2019-0708.

### Upgrade hardware

Customers who want to operate their appliance in an open network are
strongly advised to update their BRS to the DIVAR IP all-in-one 5000.
