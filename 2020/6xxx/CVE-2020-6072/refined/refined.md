Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `rr_decode` function of the `libmicrodns` library when parsing compressed labels in mDNS messages. The function recursively calls itself when a pointer is encountered. However, the return value of the recursive call to `rr_decode` is not checked before potentially freeing the allocated buffer, leading to a double-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free. If the recursive call to `rr_decode` fails (returning `NULL`), the calling function does not check this return value, potentially resulting in `free` being called twice on the same memory address when the function returns at [7] and later at [12] or [13].
- **Unchecked Return Value:** The root cause is the lack of a return value check after the recursive call of the `rr_decode` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this double-free vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted mDNS message.
- **Malicious mDNS Packet:** An attacker crafts an mDNS packet that includes a compressed label that causes the `rr_decode` function to fail and then attempts to free the same memory twice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send mDNS packets to a vulnerable system. This implies that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have a route to the vulnerable host and the ability to send UDP packets to port 5353 (the default mDNS port).
- **Understanding of mDNS Protocol:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the mDNS protocol and its message structure in order to craft the malicious packet.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in `libmicrodns` version 0.1.0.
- This vulnerability is addressed by disabling the vulnerable microdns plugin in VLC.
- The Talos report provides a detailed code analysis of the vulnerability.
- The fix was released on March 20, 2020
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4671-1 addresses this vulnerability by disabling the microdns plugin.
