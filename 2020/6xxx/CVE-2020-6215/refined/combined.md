# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Vendor description:
-------------------
"SAP is one of the world’s leading producers of software for the management of
business processes."[1]

[1] <https://www.sap.com/about/what-is-sap.html>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerability documented in this advisory, attackers
can redirect users to arbitrary sites. Targeted users of such an
attack may be victims of successful phishing attempts jeopardizing the
confidentiality of logon information or other data.

SEC Consult recommends to implement the security note 3258950, where the
documented issue is fixed according to the vendor. We advise installing
the correction as a matter of priority to keep business-critical data secure.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Open Redirect Vulnerability (Patch bypass of CVE-2020-6215)
The sample Business Server Pages (BSP) application it00 suffers from an open
redirect vulnerability that is referred to by CVE-2020-6215 [2]. A patch
for this issue was made available via SAP Security Note 2872782 [3].
During analysis, it was identified that the patch is insufficient and can
be bypassed.

[2] <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6215>
[3] <https://me.sap.com/notes/2872782>

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Open Redirect Vulnerability (Patch bypass of CVE-2020-6215)
The following source code excerpt of event handler OnInputProcessing() of
BSP subpage transition_navigation.htm shows that by the implementation of
SAP Security Note 2872782, an additional check was introduced that validates
the HTTP request parameter ‘applicationUrl’ against pseudo-headers ~server_name,
respectively ~server_name_expanded. Thus, to verify that the provided URL
complies with these values to only allow redirects to the local server,
the IF condition checks if the specified ‘applicationUrl’ parameter contains
the host name of the local server. Only if this check is evaluated successfully,
the browser of the calling user gets redirected to the intended page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
when 'call'.
     data: url1      type string,
           url2      type string,
           host_name type string.
     host_name = request->get_header_field( '~server_name' ).
     if host_name is initial.
       host_name = request->get_header_field( '~server_name_expanded' ).
     endif.
     url = request->get_form_field( 'applicationUrl' ).
     if url cs host_name.
       split url at '?' into url1 url2.
       url2 = cl_abap_dyn_prg=>escape_xss_url( url2 ).
       concatenate url1 '?' url2 into url.
       navigation->call_application( url = url ).
     endif.
* negative test cases
   when 'error_no_such_exit'.
     navigation->next_page( 'NAVFAIL' ).

endcase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was observed that this check can be bypassed, for example, by crafting
special HTTP requests that contain the host name of the target application
server (the PoC uses the <app server hostname> placeholder) within the query string
part of the URL provided via parameter ‘applicationUrl’. To validate this issue,
the following URL can be browsed to in order to trigger the vulnerability and
circumvent the implemented patch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
http[s]://<app server hostname>:<ICM port>/sap/bc/bsp/sap/it00/transition_
navigation.htm?ApplicationURL=<http://127.0.0.1:8080/>?<app server hostname>
&onInputProcessing%28call%29=Start+Application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For demonstration purposes, after a successful login, the browser is redirected
by the application server to localhost on port 8080 (any other host/port pair
could by specified by the attacker).

The server replies with a "302 Found" message redirecting the browser to the
localhost address defined in the response Location header field:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/2 302 Found
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 0
Location: <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>?<app server hostname>&sap-params=[...]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker can create a URL which would redirect the victim to a malicious
site, for example, a phishing site convincing the victim to login once again.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested and found to be vulnerable:

- SAP_BASIS release 755, SP level 01

According to the vendor the following releases and versions
are affected by the discovered vulnerability:

- SAP_BASIS 700-702
- SAP_BASIS 731
- SAP_BASIS 740
- SAP_BASIS 750-757

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2022-10-03: Contacting vendor through vulnerability submission web form.
2022-10-04: Vendor confirms receipt and assigns internal ID #2270141902.
2022-10-19: Vendor confirms vulnerability and proposes new CVSS score of
             5.4 (NLNR|U|LLN).
2022-10-24: Asking vendor why new CVSS rating differs from initial
             vulnerability rating. No response.
2022-11-24: Asking vendor for update.
2022-11-30: Vendor states that the patch is about to be released with the
             upcoming Patch Tuesday December 2022.
2022-12-13: Vendor releases patch with SAP Security Note 3258950.
2023-10-05: Release of security advisory.

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.
Patches are available in form of SAP Security Notes which can be accessed
via the SAP Customer Launchpad [4]. More information can also be found in
the Official SAP Security Patchday Blog [5].

The following Security Note needs to be implemented: 3258950

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
