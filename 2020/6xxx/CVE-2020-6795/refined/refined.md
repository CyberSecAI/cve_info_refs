Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing S/MIME messages with multiple signatures. Specifically, a bug in the MIME processing code causes a null pointer dereference. This happens because the code attempts to access `obj->options->state->first_data_written_p`, but `obj->options->state` is NULL. This occurs when a MIME object is processed/cleaned up earlier, but the code attempts to access a member which had been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in `MimeObject_write`. The code doesn't handle cases where the state is null, leading to a crash.
-   **Double Processing:** The code attempts to process the same MIME object twice, leading to the null pointer dereference. `MimeMultipartSigned_emit_child` gets called twice when it should only be called once. This is related to nested S/MIME signatures within a message.
-   **Missing Flag:** The `closed_p` flag which is supposed to prevent multiple calls to `parse_eof` is not being set correctly on error, leading to double processing of some MIME objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability results in a crash of the Thunderbird application. While the crash itself is not exploitable, it can prevent users from reading emails, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Specially Crafted Email:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted email message containing nested S/MIME signatures that trigger the vulnerable code.
-   **User Interaction:** The user must open or view the specially crafted email message to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Email Sending:** Attackers need to be able to send emails to the victim's email address, or be able to inject the email in to the victim's mail inbox.
-   **No Special Access:** No special access or position is required beyond being able to send the email.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered by specific MIME structures where an email is forwarded as an attachment, and both the original and forwarded emails are S/MIME signed.
-   The vulnerability was triggered due to a regression introduced by the fix for CVE-2019-11755.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and how it can be exploited.
