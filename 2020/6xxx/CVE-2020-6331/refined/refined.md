  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing HPGL files within the hpgl plugin. This leads to a write operation before the start of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the HPGL file parsing within the hpgl plugin.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious HPGL file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HPGL file to the victim, and the victim must interact with it."
