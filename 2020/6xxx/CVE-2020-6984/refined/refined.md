Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-6984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of a broken or risky algorithm for password protection in Rockwell Automation MicroLogix controllers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of a Broken or Risky Algorithm for Password Protection (CWE-327):** The cryptographic function used to protect the password is weak and discoverable.
*  **Use of Client-Side Authentication (CWE-603):** Although not the primary vulnerability described under CVE-2020-6984, the advisory also notes the controller responds to requests with password values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive project file information, including passwords.
*   This could allow for unauthorized access to the controller and potentially allow the attacker to compromise the industrial control system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network, given the device is exposed.
*   The advisory indicates low skill is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the MicroLogix controller over the network.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability based on the CVSS vector provided.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions other related CVEs affecting the same Rockwell Automation products, namely CVE-2020-6990 (hard-coded cryptographic key), CVE-2020-6988 (client-side authentication), and CVE-2020-6980 (cleartext storage of sensitive information).
*   The CVSS v3 base score for CVE-2020-6984 is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   The advisory provides mitigation steps, including updating the firmware for some devices and limiting network exposure.
