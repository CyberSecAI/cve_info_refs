- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Permission and access control vulnerability in ZTE E8820V3 router product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control allows unauthorized modification of DDNS parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can tamper with DDNS parameters and launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on specified URLs.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the adjacent network and doesn't need any privileges or user interaction (PR:N/UI:N).
