The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the RSLogix 500 binary file. This key is used to protect account passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321)
- Use of a broken or risky algorithm for password protection (CWE-327) - note this is related to CVE-2020-6984
- Use of client-side authentication (CWE-603) - note this is related to CVE-2020-6988
- Cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312) - note this is related to CVE-2020-6980

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could identify the hard-coded cryptographic keys and use them for cryptographic attacks.
- This could lead to a remote attacker gaining unauthorized access to the controller.
- Exploitation could also lead to disclosure of sensitive project file information including passwords and SMTP server authentication data.
- The use of client-side authentication could allow attackers to bypass authentication entirely or leak credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is primarily remote for the hard-coded key and client-side authentication issues.
- A local attacker with access to a victim's project file could exploit the cleartext storage of sensitive information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For remote exploitation, an attacker needs network access to the affected Rockwell Automation devices (MicroLogix controllers).
- For the cleartext storage issue, a local attacker needs access to the victim's project files.
- Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
