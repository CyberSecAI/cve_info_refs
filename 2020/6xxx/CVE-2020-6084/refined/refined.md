- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B device parses the Electronic Key Segment within an ENIP Request Path. Specifically, the device fails to validate the length of data provided after the Key Format Table specifier in a crafted network packet. This leads to a buffer copy without proper size checking, triggering a denial of service.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Buffer Overflow:** When processing a specific type of Logical Segment (Electronic Key Segment) with a Key Format Table, the device does not check the size of input. If the provided data is shorter than expected for the Key Format Table, the device enters a fault state, leading to denial of service.
    - **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient input validation when handling network requests, specifically around the size of data associated with the Electronic Key Segment and Key Format Table, which allows attackers to cause a fault state.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition. The device loses all remote communications and requires a physical power cycle to restore functionality.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted network request sent via EtherNet/IP (ENIP) using the SendRRData command with a malicious Request Path containing an Electronic Key Segment.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device using the ENIP protocol, specifically crafted to include a malformed Electronic Key Segment with a truncated Key Format Table. This typically means being on the same network or having network access to the device. The attacker does not require any authentication.
