Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6577

**Vulnerable Product:** IT-Recht Kanzlei Plugin for Zen Cart (German version)

**Affected Version:** v1.5.6c

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `itrk-api.php` file, where the `rechtstext_language` tag from an XML POST parameter is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper sanitization or preparation. Specifically, the `$language_code` variable, derived from the `rechtstext_language` tag, is neither escaped nor used in a prepared statement, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Similar issues exist in other parts of the code (line 222).

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`rechtstext_language` tag) before using it in an SQL query.
*   **No Prepared Statements:** The SQL queries are not constructed using prepared statements, which would help prevent SQL injection.
*   **Direct Embedding of Input:** User input is directly embedded into the SQL query string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** The attacker could potentially dump or modify the database contents, including sensitive information, by exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `itrk-api.php` file with a crafted XML payload containing a malicious `rechtstext_language` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid IT-Rechtkanzlei Token:** An attacker requires a valid "IT-Rechtkanzlei" token associated with the specific Zen Cart instance. This token is randomly generated when the webshop is created, and is known to the IT-Rechtkanzlei company, making them potential exploiters.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target webshop.
