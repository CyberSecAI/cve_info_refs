  "cveId": "CVE-2020-6813",
  "description": "When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The browser was capturing the nonce attribute of the parent style tag when loading a child sheet via @import, instead of applying the CSP to the imported resource.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass",
      "Improper validation of @import statements within style tags with CSP nonce"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the Content Security Policy and potentially leading to exfiltration of sensitive page information.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Injecting CSS with an @import statement into a page protected by CSP with a nonce.",
      "The attacker must be able to inject CSS into the web page"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject CSS into a web page that is protected by a Content Security Policy using a nonce. The attacker does not need any special position in the network or any privileged access."
