# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1010

## WAGO PFC 200 Web-Based Management (WBM) Code Execution Vulnerability

##### June 10, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6090

### Summary

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the Web-Based Management (WBM) functionality of WAGO PFC 200 03.03.10(15). A specially crafted series of HTTP requests can cause code execution resulting in remote code execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

WAGO PFC 200 03.03.10(15)

### Product URLs

<https://www.wago.com/us/pfc200>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-269 - Improper Privilege Management

### Details

WAGO is a manufacturer of programmable automation controllers that are used in many industries including automotive, rail, power engineering, manufacturing, and building management.

The WBM (Web-Based Management) application provides configuration and customization to the user. WAGO documentation states that the web users are isolated from the Linux system users on the device,

The [PFC 200 750-8206 user manual](https://www.wago.com/us/d/5899) draws a clear distinction between the WBM and the Linux system users. Section 4.1.2.1.2 WBM User Group states:

```
WBM has its own user administration system. The users in this system are isolated from the other user groups in the system for security reasons.

```

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the device from the WBM admin user.

The software upload functionality of WBM allows the web-admin user to upload a software package and activate the software in the opkg `.ipk` format. The file structure of an `.ipk` file is relatively simple, and provides no integrity checks such as code signing for the software contained in the package. Below describes the contents of an `.ipk` file:

```
|-- control
|   |-- control
|   |-- postinst
|   |-- preinst
|   |-- prerm
|-- data
|   |-- usr
|   |   -- bin
|   |       -- example_binary
|   -- lib
|       -- systemd
|           -- system
|               -- example_package.service
|-- debian-binary

```

When the user activates the software package, that executes a shell script on the device called `activate_download`. The code excerpt below shows on line `097` and `109` that the package install/activate utility `opkg` is executed with root permissions:

```
095:       update-script )     if [ "install" = $action ]; then
096:                             #echo "activate" $path$filename "for update-script"
097:                             sudo /usr/bin/opkg install "$path$filename" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
098:
099:                             if [ $? != $SUCCESS ]; then
100:
101:                               status=$SHELL_ERROR
102:                               ReportError $status "(/usr/bin/opkg install $path$filename)"
103:                               SetLastError "Error while execution"
104:                             fi
105:                           fi
106:               #force overwrite
107:         if [ "force" = $action ]; then
108:                             #echo "force-overwrite" $path$filename "for update-script"
109:                             sudo /usr/bin/opkg install --force-overwrite --force-reinstall --force-downgrade "$path$filename" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null

```

Since the `opkg` utility is executed with root permissions, any of the scripts within the `control` portion of the package are also executed with root permissions. Additionally, the attacker can `force` the activation which means that the installed package can overwrite data from other packages. Forcing the activation gives an attacker the ability to overwrite system services with attacker controlled code.
