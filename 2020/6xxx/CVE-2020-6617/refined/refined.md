The provided content relates to CVE-2020-6617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An assertion failure in `stbtt__cff_int` within `stb_truetype.h` is triggered due to a crafted font file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- The code does not properly handle malformed font data, leading to a failed assertion.
- The specific vulnerability is within the `stbtt__cff_int` function and how it processes font data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The application using the vulnerable `stb_truetype.h` library will crash due to the failed assertion, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user-supplied font file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted font file to the application using the `stb_truetype.h` library. This likely requires an ability to control input to the application.
