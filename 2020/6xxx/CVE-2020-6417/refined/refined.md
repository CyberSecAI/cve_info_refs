Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an "inappropriate implementation in the installer component" of Google Chrome. This suggests a flaw in how the installer handles certain operations or data, leading to a security vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered via a "crafted registry entry", indicating that the installer is not properly validating data from or related to the registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Inappropriate implementation:  The core issue lies in a flaw in the design or implementation of the installer, allowing for a bypass in standard security controls.
- Insufficient Data Validation: The installer doesn't adequately validate data from the registry, allowing a crafted entry to trigger a vulnerability. This can be classified as an input validation weakness.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Due to the improper handling of the registry entry, a local attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary Code Execution: A successful exploit can result in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the local user. This could range from installing malware, modifying system settings, stealing data, or causing further system compromise.
- Local Privilege Escalation: While not explicitly stated, local code execution can sometimes be leveraged to achieve further privilege escalation depending on the system context.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Local Attack: This is a local attack vector meaning the attacker must have some level of access to the target system where the Chrome browser is installed.
- Crafted Registry Entry: The attacker needs to manipulate the system's registry with a specifically crafted entry that will be consumed by the Chrome installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local Access: The attacker must have local access or the ability to write a crafted registry entry on the target system.
- Low Privileges: The attacker does not need administrative privileges, as the vulnerability is rated as low privilege required.
- Understanding of Registry Structure:  The attacker must possess knowledge of the system registry as well as the specific registry keys or data points that the Chrome installer uses or relies upon.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as "inappropriate implementation in the installer" which can be classified as a logic error.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Google Chrome version 80.0.3987.87, highlighting the need for users to keep their software updated.
- Red Hat also issued an advisory (RHSA-2020:0514) which was also linked to the resolution of CVE-2020-6417 within the chromium browser package.
- openSUSE also addressed the issue in their security advisories and released patched packages to address the vulnerability
- Various other CVEs were patched at the same time as this one, indicating a broader security update for chromium based browsers.
