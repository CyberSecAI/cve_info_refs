### Content from www.onapsis.com_58ac4a27_20250119_115445.html
This content contains detailed information about CVE-2020-6287, also known as the RECON vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of authentication in a web component of SAP NetWeaver AS for Java, specifically the LM Configuration Wizard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for a critical function in the LM Configuration Wizard component. This allows unauthenticated access to administrative tasks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - An unauthenticated attacker can gain full control of the affected SAP system.
  - This includes the ability to modify financial records, steal PII, corrupt data, and modify logs.
  - Attackers can create new administrative users, bypass authorization controls, and execute arbitrary OS commands.
  - This can lead to financial loss, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Remote, unauthenticated exploitation via HTTP/HTTPS.
  - The vulnerability is present in a component exposed by default and often accessible over the internet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - No authentication is required.
  - Network access to the vulnerable SAP system.

This content contains detailed information about CVE-2020-6287.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of authentication in the LM Configuration Wizard component of SAP NetWeaver AS Java.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication in the web component allows for high-privileged activities.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Remote, unauthenticated attackers can gain unrestricted access to SAP systems.
  - Attackers can create high-privileged users.
  - Attackers can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the SAP service user.
  - Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and processes are at risk.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Exploitation through the HTTP interface.
  - Typically exposed to end users and often to the internet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - No authentication required.
  - Network access to the vulnerable SAP system is needed.

This content contains detailed information about CVE-2020-6287, also known as the RECON vulnerability.

-   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because of a lack of authentication checks on a web service exposed by default in SAP NetWeaver Java.
-   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core issue is the absence of authentication for the `CTCWebService` SOAP endpoint, allowing unauthenticated access to administrative tasks.
-   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An unauthenticated attacker can fully compromise the targeted system, gaining unrestricted access.
    *   This includes creating admin users, assigning authorizations, and disclosing sensitive information.
    *   The attacker can gain full control over the affected SAP system, its underlying business data and processes
    *   They can read, modify or delete records, change banking details, disrupt system operation and modify logs.
-   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Remote exploitation via HTTP access to the vulnerable web service.
    *   The web service is exposed by default in SAP Netweaver Java stack, potentially making it accessible over the internet
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability
    *   Network access to the vulnerable SAP system's HTTP(S) service

### Content from github.com_4bf4d0f3_20250119_134016.html
This content contains information about a vulnerability scanner and IoC tool related to CVE-2020-6287

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The tool is designed to detect the RECON vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Java stack due to a lack of authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability resides in the LM Configuration Wizard component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The tool is designed to detect if a system is vulnerable to exploitation, which could lead to full system compromise, admin user creation, arbitrary assignment of authorizations, and information disclosure.
-   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The tool can be used to scan systems using URLs or a file with URLs, checking for the presence of the vulnerability.
    *   It can also analyze log files to detect indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to the vulnerability.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The tool is a vulnerability scanner for security professionals and can be used with various network configurations.
    *   No user authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability
    *   Access to the SAP application logs is needed to detect IoCs.
