[Download Threat Report](#download)](#download)

![](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/Onapsis-Threat-Research-Labs.jpg "Onapsis Threat Research Labs")
### The Onapsis Research Labs and the SAP Security Response Team worked together to uncover and mitigate the serious RECON vulnerability.

Identified as HotNews SAP Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) (CVE-2020-6287) in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes, the RECON (Remotely Exploitable Code On NetWeaver) vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10 out of 10 (the most severe) and can potentially be exploited impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of mission-critical SAP applications.

A successful exploit of RECON could give an unauthenticated attacker full access to the affected SAP system. This includes the ability to modify financial records, steal personally identifiable information (PII) from employees, customers and suppliers, corrupt data, delete or modify logs and traces and other actions that put essential business operations, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance at risk.

The RECON vulnerability affects a default component present in every SAP application running the SAP NetWeaver Java technology stack. This technical component is used in many SAP business solutions, including SAP SCM, SAP CRM, SAP PI, SAP Enterprise Portal and SAP Solution Manager (SolMan), impacting more than 40,000 SAP customers.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the RECON vulnerability? What Does it Mean?

In May 2020, the Onapsis Research Labs identified a serious vulnerability affecting a component included in many SAP applications. Tagged with a CVSS Score of 10, the RECON (Remotely Exploitable Code On NetWeaver) vulnerability, resides in a default core application. Since this vulnerability can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers, systems exposed to untrusted networks such as the internet could be opportunistically targeted by attackers.

Based on affected versions, Onapsis estimates that over 40,000 SAP systems may be affected by this vulnerability. Onapsis estimates there are at least 2,500 vulnerable SAP systems directly exposed to the internet, with 45% in North America, 12% in Europe and 30% in Asia-Pacific.

Following the Onapsis coordinated disclosure policy, Onapsis reported this vulnerability to SAP and closely worked together with its Security Response Team to address it. SAP has released SAP HotNews Security Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) addressing this issue.

#### I’m an SAP customer, how do I need to react to RECON?

Vulnerabilities such as RECON are not often seen, but these types of security issues compensate for their rareness with business and compliance impact. As explained in this threat report, an attacker leveraging this vulnerability will have unrestricted access to critical business information and processes in a variety of different scenarios. Based on how widespread this vulnerability is across SAP products, most SAP customers will likely be impacted. Onapsis has been working closely with the SAP Security Response Team to report and fix this vulnerability with the patch being released in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes.

It is fundamental for SAP customers to apply the patch and follow the provided recommendations to stay protected. Continuous monitoring of SAP systems and the automated assessment of security configurations is imperative to ensure that mission-critical information and processes are secure.

#### Is there a patch available for the RECON vulnerability?

The Onapsis Research Labs and the SAP Security Response Team worked together to patch the RECON vulnerability in record time. Identified as HotNews SAP Security Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes release, the RECON vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10 out of 10 (the most severe) and can potentially be exploited impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of mission-critical SAP applications.

#### Why are so many organizations at risk of the RECON vulnerability?

This vulnerability resides inside SAP NetWeaver Java versions 7.30 to 7.50. All Support Packages tested by the Onapsis Research Labs to date were vulnerable. SAP NetWeaver is the base layer for several SAP products and solutions. This means that a broad range of products could be impacted for more than 40,000 SAP customers.

#### What SAP solutions are affected?

Affected SAP solutions include, but are not limited to:

* SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
* SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)
* SAP CRM (Java Stack)
* SAP Enterprise Portal
* SAP HR Portal
* SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) 7.2
* SAP Landscape Management (SAP LaMa)
* SAP Process Integration/Orchestration (SAP PI/PO)
* SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
* SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure (MI)
* SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (NWDI)
* SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE)

Since SAP SolMan is affected and deployed in almost every SAP environment, it is a safe assumption that almost every SAP customer has at least one system affected by this vulnerability.

#### If my organization is not using SAP in the cloud or exposing SAP systems to the internet, should I care about them?

Absolutely. Malicious threat actors do not need these systems to be exposed to the internet or in the cloud to attack them, as they can typically gain access to the network “behind the firewall” through spear-phishing and other attacks.

Once inside the network, it is very common to find that SAP applications like the ones affected by RECON are accessible to satisfy business use cases. In this case, as an attacker would not even need to have a valid user id in the target SAP application, it is very likely that they could successfully compromise them if not patched.

Furthermore, most large organizations have already realized that their “internal network” is not controlled as it used to be, as today VPNs, BYOD, outsourced contractors and many other variables create an environment where it is not possible to trust the connected devices.

#### What is the business impact of the RECON vulnerabilities in my organization?

If an unauthenticated attacker is able to connect to the HTTP(S) service and perform a successful exploitation of the RECON vulnerability, the impact could be critical in some situations. Technically speaking, an attacker would be able to create a new user in the vulnerable SAP system with maximum privileges (Administrator role), bypassing all access and authorization controls (such as segregation of duties, identity management and GRC solutions). This means that the attacker could gain full control of the affected SAP system, its underlying business data and processes.

Having administrative access to the system will allow the attacker to manage (read/modify/delete) every record/file/report in the system. Because of the type of unrestricted access an attacker would obtain by exploiting unpatched systems, this vulnerability also may constitute a deficiency in an enterprise’s IT controls for regulatory mandates—potentially impacting financial (Sarbanes-Oxley) and privacy (GDPR) compliance. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform several malicious activities, including:

* Steal personally identifiable information (PII) from employees, customers and suppliers
* Read, modify or delete financial records
* Change banking details (account number, IBAN number, etc.)
* Administer purchasing processes
* Disrupt the operation of the system by corrupting data or shutting it down completely
* Perform unrestricted actions through operating system command execution
* Delete or modify traces, logs and other files.

With SAP NetWeaver Java being a fundamental base layer for several SAP products, the specific impact would vary depending on the affected system. In particular, there are different SAP solutions running on top of NetWeaver Java which share a common particularity: they are hyper-connected through APIs and interfaces. In other words, these applications are attached to other systems, both internal and external, usually leveraging high-privileged trust relationships.

#### Who should be aware of this risk at my organization?

Management should be aware of this risk, starting with the CISO and CIO up to the CFO and CEO. Additionally, given the potential compliance implications of this type of deficiencies on business-critical systems, your Internal Audit team and the Head of Compliance and Audit should assess this risk.

#### Would this vulnerability be found by my GRC solution/segregation of duties controls?

Unfortunately, this vulnerability cannot be detected by any solution performing GRC or segregation of duties (SoD) controls for SAP. Because these attacks would be unauthenticated requiring no user credentials or passwords, attackers can easily bypass any existing SoD controls.

#### Would this be mitigated by IT general controls?

Unfortunately, the RECON vulnerability is not under the general scope of IT General Controls (ITGC). Even in a scenario where ITGCs have a satisfactory state in your SAP environment, the presence of this risk could equal the combination of several ITGCs deficiencies. Based on our experience, the associated risks with vulnerabilities such as RECON are usually not included in traditional audits. We encourage internal and external auditors to include a risk assessment of the RECON vulnerability as part of your ITGC audits for SAP systems.

#### Are perimeter security defense enough to keep our organization protected?

If exploited, an unauthenticated attacker (no username or password required) can create a new SAP user with maximum privileges, bypassing all access and authorization controls (such as segregation of duties, identity management and GRC solutions) and gaining full control of SAP systems. The RECON vulnerability is particularly dangerous because many of the affected solutions are often exposed to the internet to connect companies with business partners, employees and customers, which drastically increases the likelihood of remote attacks.

#### Had this vulnerability been compromised in any SAP customers?

Onapsis has no evidence of the RECON vulnerability being exploited in the wild to date, but based on our field experience with customers, partners and prospects, we can confirm that any unpatched SAP system can be vulnerable to attacks. In fact, as most organizations are not able to detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, a system compromise may go undetected.

Cybersecurity Advisory
# Critical Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS Java

Last RevisedJuly 13, 2020
Alert CodeAA20-195A

### Summary

On July 13, 2020 EST, SAP released a [security update](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=552599675) to address a critical vulnerability, [CVE-2020-6287](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=552599675), affecting the SAP NetWeaver Application Server (AS) Java component LM Configuration Wizard. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to take control of trusted SAP applications.

Due to the criticality of this vulnerability, the attack surface this vulnerability represents, and the importance of SAP’s business applications, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) strongly recommends organizations immediately apply patches. CISA recommends organizations prioritize patching internet-facing systems, and then internal systems.

Organizations that are unable to immediately patch should mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the LM Configuration Wizard service (see SAP Security Note [#2939665](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2939665)). Should these options be unavailable or if the actions will take more than 24 hours to complete, CISA strongly recommends closely monitoring your SAP NetWeaver AS for anomalous activity.

CISA is unaware of any active exploitation of these vulnerabilities at the time of this report. However, because patches have been publicly released, the underlying vulnerabilities could be reverse-engineered to create exploits that target unpatched systems.

### Technical Details

#### Affected Systems

This vulnerability is present by default in SAP applications running on top of SAP NetWeaver AS Java 7.3 and any newer versions (up to SAP NetWeaver 7.5). Potentially vulnerable SAP business solutions include any SAP Java-based solutions such as (but not limited to):

* SAP Enterprise Resource Planning,
* SAP Product Lifecycle Management,
* SAP Customer Relationship Management,
* SAP Supply Chain Management,
* SAP Supplier Relationship Management,
* SAP NetWeaver Business Warehouse,
* SAP Business Intelligence,
* SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure,
* SAP Enterprise Portal,
* SAP Process Orchestration/Process Integration),
* SAP Solution Manager,
* SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure,
* SAP Central Process Scheduling,
* SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment, and
* SAP Landscape Manager.

#### Attack Surface

The vulnerability was identified in a component that is part of the SAP NetWeaver AS Java. This technology stack is part of the SAP Solution Manager, which is a support and system management suite.

The SAP NetWeaver AS for Java technology supports the SAP Portal component, which may therefore be affected by this vulnerability and is typically exposed to the internet. Passive analysis of internet-facing applications indicates that a number of such applications are connected to the internet and could be affected by this vulnerability.

#### Description

On July 13, 2020 EST, SAP released the patch for a critical vulnerability, [CVE-2020-6287](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6287), affecting its NetWeaver AS for Java component. This vulnerability can lead to compromise of vulnerable SAP installations, including the modification or extraction of highly sensitive information, as well as the disruption of critical business processes. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability through an HTTP interface, which is typically exposed to end users and, in many cases, exposed to the internet.

The vulnerability is introduced due to the lack of authentication in a web component of the SAP NetWeaver AS for Java allowing for several high-privileged activities on the SAP system.

##### Impact

If successfully exploited, a remote, unauthenticated attacker can obtain unrestricted access to SAP systems through the creation of high-privileged users and the execution of arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the SAP service user account (`<sid>adm`), which has unrestricted access to the SAP database and is able to perform application maintenance activities, such as shutting down federated SAP applications. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and processes hosted by the SAP application are at risk by this vulnerability.

### Mitigations

CISA strongly recommends organizations review SAP Security Note [#2934135](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=552599675) for more information and apply critical patches as soon as possible. CISA recommends prioritizing patching over application of individual mitigations. When patching, external facing systems should be urgently addressed, followed by internal systems.

Patched versions of the affected components are available at the [SAP One Support Launchpad](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/).

#### Additional Recommendations

CISA encourages users and administrators of SAP products to:

* Scan SAP systems for all known vulnerabilities, such as missing security patches, dangerous system configurations, and vulnerabilities in SAP custom code.
* Apply missing security patches immediately and institutionalize security patching as part of a periodic process
* Ensure secure configuration of your SAP landscape
* Identify and analyze the security settings of SAP interfaces between systems and applications to understand risks posed by these trust relationships.
* Analyze systems for malicious or excessive user authorizations.
* Monitor systems for indicators of compromise resulting from the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
* Monitor systems for suspicious user behavior, including both privileged and non-privileged users.
* Apply threat intelligence on new vulnerabilities to improve the security posture against advanced targeted attacks.
* Define comprehensive security baselines for systems and continuously monitor for compliance violations and remediate detected deviations.

These recommendations apply to SAP systems in public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.

See the Onapsis report on the [“RECON” SAP Vulnerability](https://www.onapsis.com/recon-sap-cyber-security-vulnerability) for more information.

[Download Threat Report](#download)](#download)

![](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/Onapsis-Threat-Research-Labs.jpg "Onapsis Threat Research Labs")
### The Onapsis Research Labs and the SAP Security Response Team worked together to uncover and mitigate the serious RECON vulnerability.

Identified as HotNews SAP Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) (CVE-2020-6287) in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes, the RECON (Remotely Exploitable Code On NetWeaver) vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10 out of 10 (the most severe) and can potentially be exploited impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of mission-critical SAP applications.

A successful exploit of RECON could give an unauthenticated attacker full access to the affected SAP system. This includes the ability to modify financial records, steal personally identifiable information (PII) from employees, customers and suppliers, corrupt data, delete or modify logs and traces and other actions that put essential business operations, cybersecurity and regulatory compliance at risk.

The RECON vulnerability affects a default component present in every SAP application running the SAP NetWeaver Java technology stack. This technical component is used in many SAP business solutions, including SAP SCM, SAP CRM, SAP PI, SAP Enterprise Portal and SAP Solution Manager (SolMan), impacting more than 40,000 SAP customers.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the RECON vulnerability? What Does it Mean?

In May 2020, the Onapsis Research Labs identified a serious vulnerability affecting a component included in many SAP applications. Tagged with a CVSS Score of 10, the RECON (Remotely Exploitable Code On NetWeaver) vulnerability, resides in a default core application. Since this vulnerability can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers, systems exposed to untrusted networks such as the internet could be opportunistically targeted by attackers.

Based on affected versions, Onapsis estimates that over 40,000 SAP systems may be affected by this vulnerability. Onapsis estimates there are at least 2,500 vulnerable SAP systems directly exposed to the internet, with 45% in North America, 12% in Europe and 30% in Asia-Pacific.

Following the Onapsis coordinated disclosure policy, Onapsis reported this vulnerability to SAP and closely worked together with its Security Response Team to address it. SAP has released SAP HotNews Security Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) addressing this issue.

#### I’m an SAP customer, how do I need to react to RECON?

Vulnerabilities such as RECON are not often seen, but these types of security issues compensate for their rareness with business and compliance impact. As explained in this threat report, an attacker leveraging this vulnerability will have unrestricted access to critical business information and processes in a variety of different scenarios. Based on how widespread this vulnerability is across SAP products, most SAP customers will likely be impacted. Onapsis has been working closely with the SAP Security Response Team to report and fix this vulnerability with the patch being released in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes.

It is fundamental for SAP customers to apply the patch and follow the provided recommendations to stay protected. Continuous monitoring of SAP systems and the automated assessment of security configurations is imperative to ensure that mission-critical information and processes are secure.

#### Is there a patch available for the RECON vulnerability?

The Onapsis Research Labs and the SAP Security Response Team worked together to patch the RECON vulnerability in record time. Identified as HotNews SAP Security Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135) in the July 2020 SAP Security Notes release, the RECON vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10 out of 10 (the most severe) and can potentially be exploited impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of mission-critical SAP applications.

#### Why are so many organizations at risk of the RECON vulnerability?

This vulnerability resides inside SAP NetWeaver Java versions 7.30 to 7.50. All Support Packages tested by the Onapsis Research Labs to date were vulnerable. SAP NetWeaver is the base layer for several SAP products and solutions. This means that a broad range of products could be impacted for more than 40,000 SAP customers.

#### What SAP solutions are affected?

Affected SAP solutions include, but are not limited to:

* SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
* SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)
* SAP CRM (Java Stack)
* SAP Enterprise Portal
* SAP HR Portal
* SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) 7.2
* SAP Landscape Management (SAP LaMa)
* SAP Process Integration/Orchestration (SAP PI/PO)
* SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
* SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure (MI)
* SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (NWDI)
* SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE)

Since SAP SolMan is affected and deployed in almost every SAP environment, it is a safe assumption that almost every SAP customer has at least one system affected by this vulnerability.

#### If my organization is not using SAP in the cloud or exposing SAP systems to the internet, should I care about them?

Absolutely. Malicious threat actors do not need these systems to be exposed to the internet or in the cloud to attack them, as they can typically gain access to the network “behind the firewall” through spear-phishing and other attacks.

Once inside the network, it is very common to find that SAP applications like the ones affected by RECON are accessible to satisfy business use cases. In this case, as an attacker would not even need to have a valid user id in the target SAP application, it is very likely that they could successfully compromise them if not patched.

Furthermore, most large organizations have already realized that their “internal network” is not controlled as it used to be, as today VPNs, BYOD, outsourced contractors and many other variables create an environment where it is not possible to trust the connected devices.

#### What is the business impact of the RECON vulnerabilities in my organization?

If an unauthenticated attacker is able to connect to the HTTP(S) service and perform a successful exploitation of the RECON vulnerability, the impact could be critical in some situations. Technically speaking, an attacker would be able to create a new user in the vulnerable SAP system with maximum privileges (Administrator role), bypassing all access and authorization controls (such as segregation of duties, identity management and GRC solutions). This means that the attacker could gain full control of the affected SAP system, its underlying business data and processes.

Having administrative access to the system will allow the attacker to manage (read/modify/delete) every record/file/report in the system. Because of the type of unrestricted access an attacker would obtain by exploiting unpatched systems, this vulnerability also may constitute a deficiency in an enterprise’s IT controls for regulatory mandates—potentially impacting financial (Sarbanes-Oxley) and privacy (GDPR) compliance. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform several malicious activities, including:

* Steal personally identifiable information (PII) from employees, customers and suppliers
* Read, modify or delete financial records
* Change banking details (account number, IBAN number, etc.)
* Administer purchasing processes
* Disrupt the operation of the system by corrupting data or shutting it down completely
* Perform unrestricted actions through operating system command execution
* Delete or modify traces, logs and other files.

With SAP NetWeaver Java being a fundamental base layer for several SAP products, the specific impact would vary depending on the affected system. In particular, there are different SAP solutions running on top of NetWeaver Java which share a common particularity: they are hyper-connected through APIs and interfaces. In other words, these applications are attached to other systems, both internal and external, usually leveraging high-privileged trust relationships.

#### Who should be aware of this risk at my organization?

Management should be aware of this risk, starting with the CISO and CIO up to the CFO and CEO. Additionally, given the potential compliance implications of this type of deficiencies on business-critical systems, your Internal Audit team and the Head of Compliance and Audit should assess this risk.

#### Would this vulnerability be found by my GRC solution/segregation of duties controls?

Unfortunately, this vulnerability cannot be detected by any solution performing GRC or segregation of duties (SoD) controls for SAP. Because these attacks would be unauthenticated requiring no user credentials or passwords, attackers can easily bypass any existing SoD controls.

#### Would this be mitigated by IT general controls?

Unfortunately, the RECON vulnerability is not under the general scope of IT General Controls (ITGC). Even in a scenario where ITGCs have a satisfactory state in your SAP environment, the presence of this risk could equal the combination of several ITGCs deficiencies. Based on our experience, the associated risks with vulnerabilities such as RECON are usually not included in traditional audits. We encourage internal and external auditors to include a risk assessment of the RECON vulnerability as part of your ITGC audits for SAP systems.

#### Are perimeter security defense enough to keep our organization protected?

If exploited, an unauthenticated attacker (no username or password required) can create a new SAP user with maximum privileges, bypassing all access and authorization controls (such as segregation of duties, identity management and GRC solutions) and gaining full control of SAP systems. The RECON vulnerability is particularly dangerous because many of the affected solutions are often exposed to the internet to connect companies with business partners, employees and customers, which drastically increases the likelihood of remote attacks.

#### Had this vulnerability been compromised in any SAP customers?

Onapsis has no evidence of the RECON vulnerability being exploited in the wild to date, but based on our field experience with customers, partners and prospects, we can confirm that any unpatched SAP system can be vulnerable to attacks. In fact, as most organizations are not able to detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, a system compromise may go undetected.

# Vulnerability Assessment and Indicator of Compromise (IoC) Scanner for CVE-2020-6287 (RECON)

RECON (Remotely Exploitable Code On NetWeaver) is a critical (CVSSv3 10) vulnerability affecting a number of SAP business and technical applications running on top of the SAP NetWeaver Java stack. This vulnerability was discovered by the Onapsis Research Labs, which collaborated closely with SAP to develop and release a patch on July 14, 2020. Given the criticality of this issue, the U.S. DHS CISA, BSI CERT-Bund and several other government agencies released alerts urging SAP customers to protect vulnerable applications, prioritizing internet-facing ones.

After observing significant malicious activity targeting RECON in the wild, and considering the number of vulnerable internet-facing SAP applications and the sensitivity of the data and processes typically supported by these systems, Onapsis decided to develop and release this open-source tool as quickly as possible. The goal is to help the information security and administration teams at all SAP customers protect their mission-critical applications by enabling them to assess their exposure and evaluate whether their SAP systems could have been compromised. We plan to further iterate this tool as new threat intelligence and forensic data is captured by our products, research team and the broader community.

This tool can:

1. Perform a best-effort, black-box scan of your SAP application(s) to quickly assess if they may be vulnerable to RECON.
2. Perform a *basic* analysis for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) leveraging the RECON vulnerability by analyzing SAP application logs.

This tool cannot:

1. Guarantee with 100% accuracy whether your SAP applications are vulnerable or not.
2. Find all evidence of compromise of an SAP application, all IoCs related to RECON or post-exploitation activities.

There are, however, several known limitations of this tool and its usage should not be considered a guarantee that SAP applications are either not exposed to RECON (and other vulnerabilities) or that the applications have not been compromised. Several conditions can affect the state of the assessed applications and/or log files, resulting in false positives and/or false negatives.

## Tool Output

* For vulnerability scanning, the tool returns whether RECON was detected on the scanned URLs.
* For IoC scanning, the tool returns all the events that were identified in the logs that could indicate misuse of LM CTC Configuration Management, and which could require additional forensic investigation.

If IoCs are identified, it is strongly recommended that you perform an in-depth forensic examination of the evaluated systems (and inter-connected ones), to determine the scope and extent of a potential compromise.

This tool is offered “as is” and without warranty.

**Alternate Online Version**

In order to assist SAP customers with a rapid assessment against RECON for internet-facing systems, we have also developed a free online version that supports both use cases. If preferred, you can use this service at <https://recon.onapsis.com>.

## Installation and Prerequisites

The scripts are developed in Python 3 and require you to install the following dependencies:

```
#  python3 -m venv .venv
#  . .venv/bin/activate
#  pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

Once you install the dependencies, you can use Python to run both scripts and get the Help from the command line.

### Vulnerability Scanning

For vulnerability detection, execute the following script:

```
# python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_vuln_scanner.py -h

```

You must execute the script on a system that has a network connection with the target SAP Application being analyzed. The HTTP(s) port of the SAP NetWeaver JAVA Application server should be reachable (that is, for an instance 00, it will be 50000 for HTTP, but it could be exposed through a proxy/load balancer and/or be accessible through other TCP ports such as 80 or 443).

You should use the -u parameter to include a valid URL as a parameter for testing the RECON vulnerability:

```
# python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_vuln_scanner.py -u http://myinternalportal.mycompany.com:50000/

```

You can also use the -f parameter to assess multiple URLs by providing a file containing all the URLs to be analyzed:

```
# python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_vuln_scanner.py -f file_with_urls

```

The output of the assessment is sent to stdout. It is possible to dump it into a file in the following way:

```
# python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_vuln_scanner.py -f file_with_urls >> results

```

### Indicators of Compromise Scanning

For detecting indicators of compromise, execute the following script:

```
python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_ioc_scanner.py -h

```

The script receives a filename and parses the filename to look for IoCs based on usage of the LM CTC application. The following types of files are accepted:

* applications\_xx.y.log
  The required files are located in the following folder:

  Linux: `/usr/sap/<SID>/<INSTANCE>/j2ee/cluster/server<X>/log/`

  Windows: `\usr\sap\<SID>\<INSTANCE>\j2ee\cluster\server<X>\log\`
* responses\_xx.y.trc
  Using the default format configuration. If changes were made to the standard log format configuration, the parsing could fail. In that case, the internal regex should be manually adjusted to reflect the new format. The required files are located in the following folder:

  Linux: `/usr/sap/<SID>/<INSTANCE>/j2ee/cluster/server<X>/log/system/httpaccess/`

  Windows: `\usr\sap\<SID>\<INSTANCE>\j2ee\cluster\server<X>\log\system\httpaccess\`

You can execute the script to analyze specific files with the -f parameter:

```
python3 RECON_CVE-2020-6287_ioc_scanner.py -f path_to_logfile

```

You can use a bash script to run the script against multiple files at the same time. For example, if the directory containing multiple logs is present in /tmp/sap\_RECON\_logs/, the execution would look like:

```
path_to_log_folder="/tmp/sap_RECON_logs/";for log_file in `ls $path_to_log_folder`; do python RECON_CVE-2020-6287_ioc_scanner.py -f $path_to_log_folder/$log_file -o csv; done

```

Function
- CVSS v3 score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- Risk Level: Critical
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-6287
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2934135

## Affected Components Description

LM CONFIGURATION WIZARD is a part of SAP NetWeaver JAVA which is a
foundational layer used by several SAP products, such as:
- SAP Enterprise portal
- SAP Solution Manager
- SAP PI/PO
- SAP Landscape Manager
- among others.

All products running on top of SAP JAVA NetWeaver will be affected by this
vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

The CTCWebService SOAP endpoint doesn't require user authentication in
order to interact with it. The functionality exposed by this Web Service
allows users to perform several administration tasks. As no authentication
is required, any malicious actor with HTTP access to the service, could
abuse these functionalities in order to fully compromise the targeted
system.

Some examples of what could be achieved:

- Admin user creation.
- Arbitrary assignment of authorizations to a user.
- Information disclosure.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 2934135 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2934135>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related security
fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to reduce business
risks.

* ***July Summary***—20 new and updated [SAP security patches](https://onapsis.com/blog/blog-category/sap-security-notes) released including two *HotNews* Notes and two *High Priority* Notes
* ***RECON***—New CVSS Score of 10.0 vulnerability, detected by Onapsis Research Labs, requires urgent patch of SAP NetWeaver AS Java
* ***Onapsis Research Labs Collaboration***—Our team was involved in fixing five vulnerabilities covered by four Security Notes

SAP has released 20 new or updated [Security Notes](https://onapsis.com/blog/blog-category/sap-security-notes) on its July patch day. While the number of critical notes is very moderate compared to the last patch days with “only” two *HotNews* notes and two *High Priority* notes, it is nevertheless a patch day that requires maximum attention from all SAP customers. SAP has published patches for the extremely critical RECON vulnerability (CVSS Score of 10.0) that affects all SAP applications running on SAP NetWeaver AS Java and strongly recommends immediate patching. In addition to the RECON vulnerability that was detected by [Onapsis researcher Pablo Artuso](https://onapsis.com/blog/author/pablo-artuso), our research team contributed in solving four more threats.

## In Focus: Protecting Your Systems From the Critical RECON Vulnerability

In May 2020, the Onapsis Research Labs detected an extremely serious vulnerability that affects all SAP applications running on SAP NetWeaver AS Java. Due to its criticality and thanks to the fast reaction of the SAP Security Response Team after Onapsis reported the flaw, SAP fixed it within only a few weeks. SAP Security Note #[2934135](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2934135), tagged with the highest possible CVSS Score of 10.0, was published in the SAP July Security Notes and provides the corresponding patch.

Due to the seriousness of the RECON vulnerability, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued US-CERT Alert, [AA20-195A](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-195a), in coordination with BSI CERT-Bund, followed by other global organizations providing warnings about potential threats associated with this vulnerability.

## What Makes the RECON Vulnerability So Dangerous?

The RECON vulnerability affects a core component that is included in the SAP Java NetWeaver layer. It can be exploited by remote unauthenticated attackers and therefore all systems exposed to untrusted networks such as the Internet represent a potential attack target. The list of directly affected SAP applications is quite large:

* SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
* SAP Supply Chain Management (SCM)
* SAP CRM (Java Stack)
* SAP Enterprise Portal
* SAP HR Portal
* SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) 7.2
* SAP Landscape Management (SAP LaMa)
* SAP Process Integration/Orchestration (SAP PI/PO)
* SAP Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)
* SAP NetWeaver Mobile Infrastructure (MI)
* SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (NWDI)
* SAP NetWeaver Composition Environment (CE)
* Others

With SAP NetWeaver Java being a fundamental base layer for several SAP products, the specific impact would vary depending on the affected system. In particular, there are different SAP solutions running on top of NetWeaver Java which share a common particularity: they are hyperconnected through APIs and interfaces. In other words, these applications are attached to other systems, both internal and external, usually leveraging high-privileged trust relationships.

The way SAP applications are opened to the internet in the form of SAP Enterprise Portals, combined with integration technologies such as SAP SolMan or SAP Process Integration, creates an environment in which the exploitation of a vulnerability with a CVSS Score of 10.0 could ultimately lead to business data and PII being compromised.

The following sections will discuss in more detail some examples of widely-used SAP applications that share this pattern of API-based hyperconnectivity and are affected by this vulnerability.

### SAP Enterprise Portals

SAP Enterprise Portals provide an integrated entry point to HR processes, financial information and supply chain management processes. Attackers being able to compromise these systems can ultimately cause a significant impact to organizations not only from a pure data breach and risk perspective, but as we are talking about business processes, they are also subject to compliance and regulatory requirements.

### SAP Process Integration

The SAP Process Integration (PI) module is a part of the SAP NetWeaver platform that facilitates the communication and integration of business processes, with both SAP and non-SAP systems. It provides a single point of interaction to exchange information between the different components such as Sales & Distribution (SD), Finance & Cost Controlling (FICO), Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM), among others.

In spite of applying a secure configuration for the SAP PI module, an attacker could acquire high privileges acquired by exploiting the RECON vulnerability to display, change or delete sensitive data from any of the modules connected to the SAP PI—disrupting critical integrations with strategic business partners and essential processes. Given that the attacker could get administrator privileges in the SAP PI module, it could be strategically used as a pivot to get sensitive information from several modules such as the ones mentioned before.

### SAP Solution Manager

SAP SolMan aims to centralize the management of all SAP and non-SAP systems that are within an organization’s landscape. As an administration solution, it performs actions such as implementation, support, monitoring and maintenance of the SAP enterprise applications and systems.

If an attacker is able to compromise SolMan, they will be able to abuse established trust relationships and pivot to any satellite system. Trusted relationships between SolMan and its connected systems are commonly configured to be highly privileged, becoming an interesting vector from the attacker’s point of view to gain further access to business data stored in satellite systems.

### Business Impact of Potential Exploit

Once a system is compromised, the possible impact is almost unlimited. Among other things, attackers can create a new user with administrative privileges, allowing them to manage (read/modify/delete) every record/file/report in the system. No need to mention the possible resulting impact on the system’s confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Because of the type of unrestricted access an attacker would obtain by exploiting unpatched systems, this vulnerability also may constitute a deficiency in an enterprise’s IT controls for regulatory mandates—potentially impacting financial (Sarbanes-Oxley) and privacy (GDPR) compliance.

Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to perform several malicious activities, including:

* Steal personal identifiable information (PII) from employees, customers and suppliers
* Read, modify or delete financial records
* Change banking details (account number, IBAN number, etc.)
* Administer purchasing processes
* Disrupt the operation of the system by corrupting data or shutting it down completely
* Perform unrestricted actions through operating system command execution
* Delete or modify traces, logs and other files

The business impact of a potential exploit targeting RECON could be financial loss, compliance violations and reputation damage for the organization experiencing a cyber attack.

Given the enormous impact on thousands of SAP applications, Onapsis strongly recommends to apply the provided patch. As a workaround, customers can disable the affected Java application if it is not needed. A detailed description of how to disable the vulnerable application can be found in SAP Note #[2939665](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2939665), released by SAP.

## Additional Contribution From the Onapsis Research Labs

SAP has solved four Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in SAP BusinessObjects on July’s patch day. One of these vulnerabilities was reported by Onapsis Research Labs and patched with SAP Security Note #[2849967](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2849967), tagged with CVSS Score of 6.1. This vulnerability is caused by an insufficient encoding of user controlled inputs.

SAP Security Note #[2896025](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2896025) describes a Server-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in a SAP NetWeaver AS Java service that allows an attacker to target internal systems behind firewalls that are normally inaccessible from the external network by sending special crafted requests. Possible impacts range from information gathering for further attacks to the bypass of firewalls to force the vulnerable server to perform malicious requests. The CVSS Score of 5.8 reflects the fact that an attack is not very complex and can be started remotely while there is no need for privileges or user interaction.

The Onapsis Research Labs also detected an Information Disclosure vulnerability in the search functionality of transaction AL11 on SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP, allowing an administrative user to detect and download files that are actually protected against access. SAP Security Note #[2927373](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2927373), tagged with CVSS Score of 2.7, provides the corresponding patch. As an exploit of this vulnerability requires administrative privileges and because of its low impact, the note is categorized with *Low Priority*.

## Other Important SAP Security Notes in July

The second *HotNews* Note is the recurring SAP Security Note #[2622660](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2622660), providing the newest patch for SAP Business Client and including the latest supported version of Google Chromium (Chromium 83.0.4103.97). Compared to the last update of SAP Business Client, the new included Chromium version contains 43 fixes in total with a highest CVSS Score of 9.6.

The two *High Priority* Notes fix Information Disclosure vulnerabilities in SAP NetWeaver AS Java and SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP.

SAP Security Note #[2932473](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2932473), tagged with CVSS Score of 7.7, fixes a bug in the SAP XML Toolkit for Java that allows attackers to access arbitrary files which would otherwise be restricted. Such information can be used afterwards to start further exploits.

SAP Security Note #2734580, tagged with CVSS Score of 7.4, is the second update on a note that was initially released on SAP’s May Patch Day. An additional note was added to the Prerequisite section.

## Summary & Conclusions

With only four critical Security Notes of 20 notes in total, SAP’s July patch day seems to be one of the calmer patch days. However, with the publication of the RECON vulnerability, this patch month is one of the most critical of the year. For the second time in 2020, Onapsis helped SAP in patching a CVSS Score of 10.0 vulnerability.

The RECON vulnerability demonstrates once more that it requires the effort of all members of the SAP community in order to defend serious cyberattacks—SAP partners like Onapsis that continuously searches for unknown vulnerabilities, SAP to fix reported threats, and last but not least every SAP customer who should finally implement the provided patch as soon as possible.
