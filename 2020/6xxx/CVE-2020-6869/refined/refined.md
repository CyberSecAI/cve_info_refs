- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Activity Component exposure
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information leak, allows silent installation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can obtain private cookies and execute silent installations.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation through exposed Activity Components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the exposed Activity Component, requiring low privilege and no user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
