Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6061:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a heap out-of-bounds read in the CoTURN web server's handling of HTTP POST requests. The `post_parse` function does not correctly manage the `data` pointer and `data_len` when skipping leading newline and carriage return characters within the POST request body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Heap out-of-bounds read:** The `memcpy` function reads data from a location beyond the allocated buffer due to an incorrect `data_len` value. This is because while the `data` pointer is incremented the `data_len` is not decremented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from memory, potentially including data from other requests.
- **Other Misbehavior:** Depending on memory layout, exploitation could lead to further memory corruption, unpredictable program behavior, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the CoTURN web server. The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTPS request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the CoTURN server.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `post_parse` function, specifically:
  ```c
  static struct headers_list * post_parse(char *data, size_t data_len)
  {
    while((*data=='\r')||(*data=='\n')) ++data;
    char *post_data = (char*)calloc(data_len + 1, sizeof(char));
    memcpy(post_data, data, data_len);
  ```
- The `while` loop increments the `data` pointer without decrementing `data_len`.
- The `memcpy` copies `data_len` bytes starting from the incremented `data` pointer, potentially reading out of bounds.
- An example POST request to trigger the vulnerability:
  `"POST /logon HTTP/1.1\r\nContent-Length: 32717\r\n\r\n"  + "\x0d"*33000 + "u\r\n\r\n\r\n"`

**Mitigation:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by a patch that ensures correct bounds checking and prevents out-of-bounds memory access.
- Patched versions include:
  - Fedora: coturn-4.5.1.1-3.fc30, coturn-4.5.1.1-3.fc31, coturn-4.5.1.1-3.fc32
  - Ubuntu: coturn 4.5.0.3-1ubuntu0.3, 4.5.0.7-1ubuntu2.18.04.2, 4.5.1.1-1.1ubuntu0.19.10.1, 4.5.1.1-1.1ubuntu0.20.04.1
  - Debian: 4.5.0.5-1+deb9u2, 4.5.1.1-1.1+deb10u1
