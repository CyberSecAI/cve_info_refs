# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1008

## Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B ENIP Request Path Network Segment Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### February 2, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6088

### Summary

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the ENIP Request Path Network Segment functionality of Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B. A specially crafted network request can cause a loss of communications with the device resulting in denial-of-service. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B 4.003

### Product URLs

<http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/IO/In-Cabinet-Modular/1794-FLEX-IO-Modules>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-120 - Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (‘Classic Buffer Overflow’)

### Details

The 1794-AENT FLEX I/O is a modular I/O platform produced by Allen-Bradley. It is designed to provide a wide range of I/O operations while keeping a smaller form factor. Communication with the device is primarily possible via EtherNet/IP (ENIP) and HTTP.

When using ENIP to communicate with the device, the SendRRData command can be used to send an encapsulated unconnected message. One field necessary for unconnected packets is the Request Path, also referred to as the EPATH or IOI. This value contains pairs of bytes, referred to as segments, that reference different parts of a CIP entity. Through use of a combination of segments, a description of the device can be represented.

Segments are structured as a bitfield, using the high three bits to indicate the segment type and the remaining to indicate the segment format. This can be seen in the table below:

```
+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
|  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
|  Segment Type   |       Segment Format        |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

```

Of the eight possible Segment Types, seven are defined and one is reserved for future use. The breakdown for this field can be seen in the table below:

```
                          +===+===+===+
                          | 7 | 6 | 5 |
+-------------------------+===+===+===+
| Port Segment            | 0 | 0 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Logical Segment         | 0 | 0 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Network Segment         | 0 | 1 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Symbolic Segment        | 0 | 1 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Data Segment            | 1 | 0 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Data Type (constructed) | 1 | 0 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Data Type (elementary)  | 1 | 1 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+
| Reserved                | 1 | 1 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+

```

Each of the Segment Types then implements its own fields for the remaining bits in the field.

When a Network Segment is chosen, the remaining bits get further broken up as shown below:

```
+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
|  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
|      Segment Sub-Type       |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

```

Of the possible Sub-Types, only three are not reserved for future use. The breakdown for this field can be seen in the table below:

```
                          +===+===+===+===+===+
                          | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
+-------------------------+===+===+===+===+===+
| Reserved                | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+
| Schedule Segment        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+
| Fixed Tag Segment       | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+
| Production Inhibit Time | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+
|                         | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
+                         +---+---+---+---+---+
| Reserved                |        ...        |
+                         +---+---+---+---+---+
|                         | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
+-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+

```

If any reserved Segment Sub-Type between 0x50 and 0x5f is supplied, the device treats the byte following as the Network Segment Length in words. When this value represents a size greater than what remains in the packet data, the device enters a fault state where communication with the device is lost and a physical power cycle is required.
