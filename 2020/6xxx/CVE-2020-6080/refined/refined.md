Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-6080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `rr_read_TXT` function of the `libmicrodns` library, specifically in how it parses TXT resource records within mDNS messages.
- The function reads length-prefixed strings from the RDATA section of a TXT record. It allocates memory for each string using `malloc`. If an invalid length is encountered while parsing (specifically, if `*n < l` at [16]), the function returns `NULL` without freeing previously allocated `text` structures, causing a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Resource Leak:** Uncontrolled resource consumption due to memory not being freed during error conditions in TXT record parsing.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `rr_read_TXT` function does not properly handle cases where the length of a string specified within the TXT record exceeds the remaining data in the packet.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending crafted mDNS packets with TXT records containing invalid string lengths can lead to memory exhaustion in the application using `libmicrodns`, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
- The vulnerability leads to resource exhaustion via memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network-based:** An attacker can send malicious mDNS packets over the network to the vulnerable service/application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a vulnerable service using the `libmicrodns` library. No specific positioning is required.
- The attacker needs to craft mDNS packets with TXT records that include more than one string and have an invalid length at the end of the RDATA section.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libmicrodns` version 0.1.0.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a TXT record containing multiple strings and an invalid string length at the end of the RDATA section.
*   The `rr_read_TXT` function allocates memory for each string, but when the function returns due to an error condition it does not free the allocated memory leading to the leak.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the allocated resources are freed when an error occurs during TXT record processing
