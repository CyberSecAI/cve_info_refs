{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation when calculating the daily plan, allowing an attacker to specify a large number of future days for calculation, leading to resource exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to insufficient input validation and resource management during daily plan calculation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in the JOC Cockpit becoming unavailable due to resource exhaustion.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by modifying or starting a job or order and parameterizing it to calculate the daily plan for an excessive number of future days. This operation can also be triggered through the REST API.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a valid account with privileges to modify or start jobs or orders within the application. They must have valid account credentials."
