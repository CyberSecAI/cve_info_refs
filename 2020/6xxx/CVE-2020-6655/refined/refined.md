Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-6655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing E70 files within Eaton EASYsoft software. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs due to this improper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data past the end of an allocated memory buffer.
*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate the contents of the E70 file, which leads to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, allowing them to gain control over the affected system.
*   The application can crash due to the out-of-bounds read.
*   A successful exploit could lead to modification or crashing of the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local; an attacker must trick a user into opening a malicious E70 file within the Eaton EASYsoft application.
*   User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability; the target must either visit a malicious page or, more likely, open a malicious .E70 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a crafted malicious .E70 file.
*   The attacker requires the user to open the file using a vulnerable version of Eaton EASYsoft.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed as a zero-day because Eaton did not provide a patch within the ZDI's 120-day deadline.
*   The vulnerability affects Eaton EASYsoft versions 7.xx prior to 7.22.
*   The vendor has released a patch in version 7.22.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   No reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of advisory release.
