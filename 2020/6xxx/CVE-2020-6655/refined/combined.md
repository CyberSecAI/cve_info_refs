## (0Day) Eaton EASYsoft E70 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1443ZDI-CAN-11082

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Eaton |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | EASYsoft |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Eaton EASYsoft. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of E70 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.  05/29/20 - ZDI reported the vulnerability to ICS-CERT08/26/20 - The vendor requested technical clarification 08/27/20 - ZDI provided additional evidence10/05/20 - ZDI requested a status update 10/08/20 - Eaton requested an extension 10/08/20 - ZDI granted an extension until December12/10/20 - ZDI notified ICS-CERT of the intention to publish the report as 0-day advisory on 12/15/2020  -- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the application. |

Eaton Vulnerability Advisory

ETN-VA-2020-1009: Multiple security issues in Eaton’s easySoft Software

Date

01/21/2021

Overall Risk

Medium

CVSS v3.0

5.8

 v1.1

Overview

Eaton has been made aware of security vulnerabilities in its easySoft software used to program easy
controllers and displays. The software provides circuit diagram input and editing, and the diagrams
can be displayed in the format desired. An integrated offline simulation tool allows users to test a
circuit diagram before commissioning. It supports users who are configuring, programming and
defining parameters for all the intelligent relays and creating visualization functions for the MFD
displays

Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-6655

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.8 – AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read

CWE-20: Improper input Validation

The easySoft software v7.xx prior to v7.22 are susceptible to Out-of-bounds read remote code
execution vulnerability. A malicious entity can execute a malicious code or make the application crash
by tricking user to upload the malformed .E70 file in the application. The vulnerability arises due to
improper validation and parsing of the E70 file content.

References – ZDI-20-1443

CVE-2020-6656

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.8 – AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

CWE-843: Access to Resource Using Incompatible Type (‘Type Confusion’)

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

The easySoft software v7.xx prior to v7.22 are susceptible to file parsing type confusion remote code
execution vulnerability. A malicious entity can execute a malicious code or make the application crash
by tricking user upload a malformed .E70 file in the application. The vulnerability arises due to
improper validation of user data supplied through E70 file which is causing Type Confusion.

Eaton Vulnerability Advisory

v1.0

Affected Product(s) and Version(s)

Product – easySoft Software

Version – 7.xx prior to 7.22

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

Eaton has patched the issues and released a new version 7.22. The latest version can be
downloaded from Eaton’s web site

- easySoft easy Controller and Display Programming Software | Eaton

- Navigate to Eaton software download center -> Select “Software” -> “easySoft” -> v7.22

Mitigation

Only use .E70 files that are either created by you or have been acquired from a fully trusted source.

If the application crashes due to .E70 file upload, restart the application and don’t upload the .E70
again.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords  or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.

## 4. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 4.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

* Versions 7.20 and prior of EASYsoft are affected

### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html)

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Francis Provencher {PRL}, working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------**

Eaton has patched the issues and released [Version 7.22](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/catalog/machinery-controls/easysoft.html), which can be downloaded from Eaton’s website.

Navigate to [Eaton software download center](https://www.eaton.com/EN/nederland/Productenoplossingen/Electrical/Klantondersteuning/DownloadCenterSoftware/index.htm) -> Select “Software” -> “easySoft” -> v7.22

**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------**

Eaton recommends those affected by the report vulnerabilities use only .E70 files created from a fully trusted source.

If the application crashes due to .E70 file upload, restart the application and do not upload the .E70 file again.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

High skill is needed to exploit. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely. No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
