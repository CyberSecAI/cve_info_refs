- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and password hashes, and other data.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/opensis/ResetUserInfo.php` page with a malicious SQL payload in the `username_stn_id` parameter.
