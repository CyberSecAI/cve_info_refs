Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-6396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "inappropriate implementation" within the Skia graphics library. This improper implementation leads to the potential for spoofing the contents of the Omnibox (URL bar).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inappropriate Implementation:**  The core issue is a flawed implementation within Skia, specifically how it handles certain operations that affect the Omnibox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing Omnibox Contents:** A remote attacker can manipulate a crafted HTML page to display a false or misleading URL in the browser's address bar. This can trick users into believing they are on a legitimate website when they are actually on a malicious one, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
*   **Medium severity:** SUSE rates this as important with a CVSS v3 score of 4.3/6.5 and CVSS v2 score of 4.3

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be local to the victim.
*   **Crafted HTML Page:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, requiring no physical access to the victim's machine.
*   **Ability to Serve HTML:**  The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious HTML page to the victim (e.g. through a website or phishing email.)
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the malicious page for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Skia Library:** The vulnerability exists within the Skia graphics library which is used by Chromium.
*   **Omnibox Spoofing:** The core of the exploit is to deceive the user by altering what is displayed in the browser's address bar.
*   **Fix:** The issue was resolved in Chrome version 80.0.3987.87, indicating an update to this version or later is required for protection.
*   **Mitigation:** Users are urged to update their browsers to the fixed version and remain cautious about which websites they visit.

In summary, CVE-2020-6396 allows for a remote attacker to spoof the URL displayed in the browser's Omnibox, due to a flaw within the Skia library in versions of Chrome before 80.0.3987.87. This could be used in phishing or social engineering attacks to trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.
