      "details": "Talos Intelligence report provides a detailed analysis of CVE-2020-6555, an out-of-bounds read in Google Chrome's WebGL functionality.  \n\n- **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `ConvertIndexArray` function in ANGLE (a compatibility layer between OpenGL and Direct3D). Specifically, the `offset` and `count` values passed to `ext.drawElementsInstancedANGLE` are not properly validated, leading to an out-of-bounds read during index conversion. The `offset` value is directly used as a memory address, and the `count` value determines the number of accesses.  \n\n- **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation for `offset` and `count` parameters in WebGL's `drawElementsInstancedANGLE`.  \n\n- **Impact:** An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially leaking sensitive memory information. This could be used to bypass security mitigations.  \n\n- **Attack vector:** A malicious webpage with specially crafted JavaScript that manipulates the `offset` and `count` values in `drawElementsInstancedANGLE` can trigger the vulnerability.  \n\n- **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page. The victim has to visit the attacker-controlled web page."
