This document from CISA details multiple vulnerabilities in GE Healthcare Monitoring platforms. CVE-2020-6961 is one of them and is described as an Unprotected Storage of Credentials vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the CVE-2020-6961 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Unprotected Storage of Credentials (CWE-256)
*   **Affected Products:**

    *   CARESCAPE Telemetry Server, Version 4.3
    *   ApexPro Telemetry Server, Versions 4.2 and prior
    *   CARESCAPE Telemetry Server, Versions 4.2 and prior
    *   Clinical Information Center (CIC), Versions 4.X and 5.X
    *   CARESCAPE Central Station (CSCS), Versions 1.X
    *   CARESCAPE Central Station (CSCS), Versions 2.X
    *   B450, Version 2.X
    *   B650, Version 1.X
    *   B650, Version 2.X
    *   B850, Version 1.X
    *   B850, Version 2.X
*   **Root Cause:** The affected products store the SSH private key in configuration files without proper protection.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can gain network access to the affected system. Low skill level is required.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain the SSH private key, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the system. Successful exploitation could result in a loss of monitoring and/or loss of alarms during active patient monitoring. These vulnerabilities, if exploited, may allow an attacker to obtain PHI data, make changes at the operating system level of the device, with effects such as rendering the device unusable, otherwise interfering with the function of the device and/or making certain changes to alarm settings on connected patient monitors, and/or utilizing services used for remote viewing and control of devices on the network to access the clinical user interface and make changes to device settings and alarm limits, which could result in missed or unnecessary alarms or silencing of some alarms.
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 10.0 (Critical)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
