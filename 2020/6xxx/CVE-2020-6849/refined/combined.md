it took a moment to find the API details but this post solved my problems.
https://wordpress.org/support/topic/where-can-i-find-the-information-to-fill-in-the-fields-within-the-options-page?replies=4
After that, literally just paste the shortcode and prepopulation, field masks, EVERYTHING works as expected.

### [Good plugin, would be great if it loaded in footer.](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-plugin-would-be-great-if-it-loaded-in-footer/)

This is a great plugin for easily pulling in Marketo forms and in particular, pre-filling them if a lead is known. Much easier than writing something manually.
My only gripe with it is that it loads in the header and thus negatively affects the initial render time of pages on which it’s included. I manually modified the plugin so it loads in the footer and it still works but I feel dirty doing this and would much prefer if that functionality was built in.
Other than that I would highly recommend this plugin.

Could use some documentation for set up and styling options but everything else seems to work as advertised and is fairly painless.
