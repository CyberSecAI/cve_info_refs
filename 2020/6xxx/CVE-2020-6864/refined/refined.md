- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information leak vulnerability exists in the ZTE E8820V3 router product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information leak.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain wireless passwords, which can then be used to collect information and further attack the router.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable on the local network (AV:A). The attack is of medium complexity (AC:H), does not require any user interaction (UI:N) and has a changed security scope (S:C).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router, and it is likely that this attack is not easily automated and would require some effort.
