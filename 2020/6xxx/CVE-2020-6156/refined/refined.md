The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6156.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs during the decompression of path element token indices within the PATHS section of a USD binary file. The size of the buffer allocated for decompression is determined by the number of paths, while the size of the data read from the file is determined by a separate size value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The code reads data from the file into a buffer, and the size of the read operation is not validated against the allocated buffer's size.
- Lack of input validation: The size values used in the buffer allocation and read operation are taken directly from the file without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to control these values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By carefully crafting a malicious USD file with mismatched size values, an attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow. This overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious USD file: An attacker can create a malicious USD file and send it to a victim. When the victim's system attempts to open or process the malicious file, it triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted malicious USD file.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver this file to the victim, typically through social engineering or some kind of delivery method.
- The victim needs to open or process the file using vulnerable software for the attack to succeed.
