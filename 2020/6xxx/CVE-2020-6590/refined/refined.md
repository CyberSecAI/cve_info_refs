Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-6590:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper processing of XML input by Forcepoint products, specifically related to XML External Entities (XXE). The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URLs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The vulnerability arises from the software's failure to properly restrict XML entities from external sources, leading to the inclusion of potentially malicious external content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, attackers could potentially access sensitive information from the server or other systems that are reachable by the affected Forcepoint product. The description states the software embeds incorrect documents into its output.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through maliciously crafted XML documents. The product parses XML input, and if that XML contains an external entity declaration pointing to a malicious external resource, the product will attempt to load the resource, leading to the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide malicious XML input to the affected Forcepoint product. This could be through various interfaces where the product processes XML, although the document doesn't specify exactly how the XML input is provided. The attacker would need to craft the malicious XML in a way that exploits the vulnerable XML parsing of the Forcepoint product.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Forcepoint Web Security, prior to v8.5.4
- Forcepoint Email Security, prior to v8.5.4 with DLP enabled
- Forcepoint DLP, prior to v8.7.1
