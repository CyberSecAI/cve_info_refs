Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the password generation feature in Firefox's Private Browsing mode. When a user generates a password for a website in a private browsing window, this generated password was cached in `LoginManagerParent`. This cache was not cleared when the private browsing window was closed. Subsequently, if a user opened another private browsing window and visited the same site, the password generator would use the same cached password instead of generating a new one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Caching:** The primary weakness is the improper caching of generated passwords within the `LoginManagerParent` in the browser's memory. The password generation cache was not cleared upon closing the last private browsing context.
- **Lack of Context Isolation:** The generated password was not specific to the private browsing session that generated it, but rather persisted across multiple private browsing sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Password Reuse:** Users could unintentionally reuse the same generated password on the same website in different private browsing sessions, potentially weakening their security if they intended to have different passwords for each session.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The generated password persisted in memory along with the associated origin until the browser is shut down. This could potentially allow an attacker with privileged code or memory access to extract the password and origin information.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  An attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position.
2.  A user opens a private browsing window.
3.  The user generates a password for a website.
4.  The user closes the private browsing window.
5.  The user opens another private browsing window.
6.  The user generates a password for the same website again, and the same password is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker does not need any special capabilities or position, other than relying on a user to interact with the password generator in a specific way.
-   An attacker with access to the browser's memory space (e.g., through privileged code or browser developer tools) could potentially extract cached generated passwords.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix involved clearing the password generation cache in `LoginManagerParent` upon the last private browsing context exiting.
-   This bug was classified as "sec-moderate" because it requires user interaction and does not affect all users.
-   The issue affects Firefox versions prior to 75. The fix was included in Firefox 75 and later versions.
-   There was no user notification for the potential reuse of passwords.
