- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within SQL queries. Specifically, the `email` parameter in `EmailCheck.php` and `EmailCheckOthers.php` is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the database, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service. This is due to the ability to inject arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to either `EmailCheck.php` or `EmailCheckOthers.php` with a malicious SQL payload within the `email` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated user is required to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
