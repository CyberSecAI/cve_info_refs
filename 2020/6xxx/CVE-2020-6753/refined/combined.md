[5.0.0](/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/5.0.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/compare/4.4.0...5.0.0)

Introducing V5 of WP-Auth0 ("Login by Auth0"), a major redesign and upgrade to our WordPress integration plugin. V5 includes many new features and changes:

* [WordPress 6](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-6-0/) and [PHP 8](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php) support
* Integration with the [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php), and access to its entire API (including Management API calls)
* High performance background sync using [WordPress' Cron](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/) feature
* "Flexible identifier" support, allowing users to sign in using multiple connection types without requiring extra configuration
* Expanded control over how sign ins without matching existing WordPress accounts are handled
* Enhanced session pairing between WordPress and Auth0, including session invalidation, access token refresh, and more.

V5 represents a major step forward for our WordPress plugin, and we're excited to see what you build with it!

It's important to note, if you wrote custom theme code or plugins for your WordPress site that targeted previous versions of the plugin, you may need to adjust those themes or plugins to adapt to the new version. We will be rolling this release out to the WordPress plugin store in the near future. Meanwhile, you can manually install the package using Composer using the instructions in the README.

[5.0.0 BETA1](/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/5.0.0-BETA1)
Pre-release

Pre-release

⚠️ **Version 5.0 of our plugin is now available in Beta.** This release adds a significant number of features, and includes breaking changes. We do not recommend using this release in a production environment yet, but your feedback and testing is appreciated.

## New Features

* **PHP 8.0 Support** — The plugin has been redesigned to use PHP 8.0+ language features.
* **Flexible Connection Matching** — This allows users to sign in using multiple connections to the same account. For example, with this you can now sign in using your standard email-password, or social connections you've enabled. Any connection works so long as the authenticating account shares the same (verified) email address.
* **Absentee Account Handling** — You can now choose different behaviors for handling when a user signs in successfully, but an account doesn't exist matching the email. Although Auth0 Database Connections have always handled this well on the API side with the 'Disable Sign-Ups' toggle, social connections are trickier in cases where that option doesn't exist. You can now choose to deny those types of authentication requests, or dynamically create new accounts for those users.
* **WP-Cron support** — The plugin now leverages the WP background task scheduler to improve performance. Because real-time Management API calls can sometimes fail (rate limits, network congestion on one's hosting provider, etc.) we can now batch changes for WP customers with high traffic sites to more efficiently bring their CMS and Auth0 databases in sync.
* **Session Pairing** — WordPress sessions are not completely managed by the plugin, ensuring scenarios like token expiration and refresh tokens are honored and properly acted upon.
* **PSR-18, PSR-17 and PSR-7 Support** — All networking functions of the plugin have been rewritten to use the PHP-FIG standards for HTTP messaging. This also removes the library's dependency on Guzzle.
* **WP\_Object\_Cache support** — Caching now uses the native WP\_Object\_Cache API, for enhanced storage options through third-party plugins. In particular, this is now used for JWKS caching, enabling improved performance.

## Breaking Changes

* PHP 8.0.0 is now the minimum supported version.
* Embedded login support has been deprecated, and Universal Login is now required.
* All `auth0_` and `a0_` prefixed functions have migrated into classes beneath the `Auth0\WordPress` namespace.
* All previous JWT processing using third-party libraries has been removed. This is now handled by [Auth0's PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP).
* `Auth0\WordPress\Plugin` handles the underlying [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) initialization and configuration.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Authentication` now handles all authentication functions, and acts as the core for the various WordPress hooks used throughout the system.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Configuration` now handles all Admin UI rendering functions. A new configuration database storage format has been established which will supersede the previous V4 method.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Sync` manages the new WP-Cron scheduled task functions.
* Sessions have been reworked to support the new Auth0 PHP SDK 8.0+ format.

Additional new features and changes may be added before this new version is released as stable.

WordPress Plugin for [Auth0](https://auth0.com) Authentication

[![License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb440dcbcc31b1982def266f64a2eda60faf19c2f85ec9d2426c6948be20fc10/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7061636b61676973742f6c2f61757468302f61757468302d706870)](https://doge.mit-license.org/)

🚀 [Getting Started](#getting-started) - 💻 [SDK Usage](#sdk-usage) - 📆 [Support Policy](#support-policy) - 💬 [Feedback](#feedback)

## Overview

The Auth0 WordPress plugin replaces the standard WordPress login flow with a new authentication process using Auth0's Universal Login experience. This enables you to secure your WordPress site with Auth0's advanced features, such as MFA, SSO, Passwordless, PassKey, and so on.

Important

This plugin is **NOT** a SDK (Software Development Kit.) It's APIs are internal and not intended for developers to extend directly. We do not support altering the plugin's behavior or integrating it in any way beyond what is outlined in this README. If you're looking to build a more extensive integration, please create a solution using the [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php) instead.

Warning

v4 of the plugin is no longer supported as of June 2023. We are no longer providing new features or bugfixes for that release. Please upgrade to v5 as soon as possible.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* PHP 8.1+
* [Most recent version of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/)
* Database credentials with table creation permissions

> Please review our [support policy](#support-policy) on specific PHP and WordPress versions and when they may exit support in the future.

### Installation

#### Composer

The plugin supports installation through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and is [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) compatible. This approach is preferred when using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), but will work with virtually any WordPress installation.

For [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) installations, you'll usually run this command from the root WordPress installation directory, but check the documentation the project's maintainers provide for the best guidance.

For standard WordPress installations, this command can be run from the `wp-content/plugins` sub-directory.

```
composer require symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7 auth0/wordpress:^5.0

```
**Note on Composer Dependencies**

When installed with Composer, the plugin depends on the presence of [PSR-18](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation) and [PSR-17](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation) library implementations. The `require` command above includes two such libraries (`symfony/http-client` and `nyholm/psr7`) that satisfy these requirements, but you can use any other compatible libraries that you prefer. Visit Packagist for a list of [PSR-18](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-client-implementation) and [PSR-17](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation) providers.

If you are using Bedrock or another Composer-based configuration, you can try installing `auth0/wordpress` without any other dependencies, as the implementations may be satisfied by other already installed packages.

> **Note** PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs) are standards for PHP libraries and applications that enable greater interoperability and choice. You can learn more about them and the PHP-FIG organization that maintains them [here](https://www.php-fig.org/).

### Activation

After installation, you must activate the plugin within your WordPress site:

1. Open your WordPress Dashboard.
2. Select 'Plugins' from the sidebar, and then 'Installed Plugins.'
3. Choose 'Activate' underneath the plugin's name.

### Configure Auth0

1. Sign into Auth0. If you don't have an account, [it's free to create one](https://auth0.com/signup).
2. [Open 'Applications' from your Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/create), and select 'Create Application.'
3. Choose 'Regular Web Application' and then 'Create.'
4. From the newly created application's page, select the Settings tab.

Please prepare the following information:

* Note the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**, available from the newly created Application's Settings page. You will need these to configure the plugin in the next step.
* From your WordPress Dashboard's General Settings page, note your **WordPress Address** and **Site Address** URLs. We recommend you read our guidance on [common WordPress URL issues](#common-wordpress-url-issues).

Continue configuring your Auth0 application from its Settings page:

* **Allowed Callback URLs** should include the URL to your WordPress site's `wp-login.php`.
  + In most (but not all) cases, this will be your WordPress Address with `/wp-login.php` appended.
  + Please ensure your site is configured never to cache this URL, or you may see an "invalid state" error during login.
* **Allowed Web Origins** should include both your WordPress Address and Site Address URLs.
* **Allowed Logout URLs** should consist of your WordPress Address.

**Common WordPress URL Issues**

* These must be the URLs your visitors will use to access your WordPress site. If you are using a reverse proxy, you may need to manually configure your WordPress Address and Site Address URLs to match the URL you use to access your site.
* Make sure these URLs match your site's configured protocol. When using a reverse proxy, you may need to update these to reflect serving over SSL/HTTPS.
**Troubleshooting**

If you're encountering issues, start by checking that your Auth0 Application is setup like so:

* **Application Type** must be set to **Regular Web Application**.
* **Token Endpoint Authentication Method** must be set to **Post**.
* **Allowed Origins (CORS)** should be blank.

Scroll down and expand the "Advanced Settings" panel, then:

* Under **OAuth**:
  + Ensure that **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to **RS256**.
  + Check that **OIDC Conformant** is enabled.
* Under **Grant Types**:
  + Ensure that **Implicit**, **Authorization Code**, and **Client Credentials** are enabled.
  + You may also want to enable **Refresh Token**.
### Configure the Plugin

Upon activating the Auth0 plugin, you will find a new "Auth0" section in the sidebar of your WordPress Dashboard. This section enables you to configure the plugin in a variety of ways.

For the plugin to operate, at a minimum, you will need to configure the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret fields. These are available from the Auth0 Application you created in the previous step. Once configured, select the "Enable Authentication" option to have the plugin begin handling authentication for you.

We recommend testing on a staging/development site using a separate Auth0 Application before putting the plugin live on your production site.

### Configure WordPress

#### Plugin Database Tables

The plugin uses dedicated database tables to guarantee high performance. When the plugin is activated, it will use the database credentials you have configured for WordPress to create these tables.

Please ensure your configured credentials have appropriate privileges to create new tables.

#### Cron Configuration

The plugin uses WordPress' [background task manager](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/) to perform important periodic tasks. Proper synchronization between WordPress and Auth0 relies on this.

By default, WordPress' task manager runs on every page load, which is inadvisable for production sites. For best performance and reliability, please ensure you have configured WordPress to use a [cron job](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/hooking-wp-cron-into-the-system-task-scheduler/) to run these tasks periodically instead.

## SDK Usage

The plugin is built on top of [Auth0-PHP](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) — Auth0's full-featured PHP SDK for Authentication and Management APIs.

For custom WordPress development, please do not extend the plugin's classes themselves, as this is not supported. Nearly all of the plugin's APIs are considered `internal` and will change over time, most likely breaking any custom extension built upon them.

Instead, please take advantage of the full PHP SDK that the plugin is built upon. You can use the plugin's `getSdk()` method to retrieve a configured instance of the SDK, ready for use. This method can be called from the plugin's global `wpAuth0()` helper, which returns the WordPress plugin itself.

```
<?php

$plugin = wpAuth0(); // Returns an instanceof Auth0\WordPress\Plugin
   $sdk = wpAuth0()->getSdk(); // Returns an instanceof Auth0\SDK\Auth0
```

Please direct questions about developing with the Auth0-PHP SDK to the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com), and issues or feature requests to [it's respective repository](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP). Documentations and examples on working with the Auth0-PHP SDKs are also available from [its repository](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP).

## Support Policy

* Our PHP version support window mirrors the [PHP release support schedule](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php). Our support for PHP versions ends when they stop receiving security fixes.
* As Automattic's stated policy is "security patches are backported when possible, but this is not guaranteed," we only support [the latest release](https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/) marked as ["actively supported"](https://endoflife.date/wordpress) by Automattic.

| Plugin Version | WordPress Version | PHP Version | Support Ends |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 6 | 8.3 | Nov 2026 |
|  |  | 8.2 | Dec 2025 |
|  |  | 8.1 | Nov 2024 |

Composer and WordPress do not offer upgrades to incompatible versions. Therefore, we regularly deprecate support within the plugin for PHP or WordPress versions that have reached end-of-life. These deprecations are not considered breaking changes and will not result in a major version bump.

Sites running unsupported versions of PHP or WordPress will continue to function but will not receive updates until their environment is upgraded. For your security, please ensure your PHP runtime and WordPress remain up to date.
