The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6991.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Moxa EDS-G516E and EDS-510E series Ethernet switches have weak password requirements, which makes it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access through brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Weak password requirements (CWE-521)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the system, potentially resulting in:
  - Confidentiality breaches (accessing sensitive information).
  - Integrity compromise (modifying system configurations).
  - Availability issues (denial of service/crashing the device).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks via remote access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the device.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required (low skill level to exploit).
