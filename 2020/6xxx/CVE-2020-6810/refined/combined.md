| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 74

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

##### References

* [Bug 1247968](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247968)

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

##### References

* [Bug 1420296](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296)

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

##### References

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

##### References

* [Bug 1613765](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613765)

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

##### References

* [Bug 1616661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661)

#### [#CVE-2020-6813: @import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature](#CVE-2020-6813)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
low
##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

* [Bug 1605814](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1605814)

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2020-6815: Memory and script safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74](#CVE-2020-6815)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Boris Zbarsky, Tyson Smith, and Alexandru Michis reported memory safety and script safety bugs present in Firefox 73. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation of privilege and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/62.0.3202.89 Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Try the code from this stack overflow answer at a webextension:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108782/firefox-webextensions-get-local-files-content-by-path/44516256#44516256>
And you'll see that it is possible to read local files without user interaction.
More information:
As far as I know this is at the moment used by Stylus and a beta version of Tampermonkey (my extension). At Tampermonkey it's necessary that the user \_explicitly\_ enables file access, just like it's necessary at Chrome, in order to use it.
However, since the stack overflow answer was posted on 2017-05-13, I guess there are some more extensions that use it. That's why and since AMO currently is using a faster/automatic review I'm a little bit concerned that other extension might use it in a non-good-natured way, because the review process is unable to detect it (in opposition to Firefox's legacy API add-ons where the reviewers took account of this).
Finally, please think about implementing user-permitted file \_read\_ access. It's one of the most requested features of Tampermonkey.
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1246236](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246236 "NEW - Implement local filesystem read/write access.")
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1266960](/show_bug.cgi?id=1266960 "NEW - Extensions can not load file: URLs")
Actual results:
It's possible to read local files without any user interaction.
Expected results:
It should (not/only after user confirmation) be possible to access local files.

This is a bug in fetch & web extension context, when the {mode:'same-origin'} flag is set. I wonder if it affects any other contexts.
MDN says: "same-origin â€” If a request is made to another origin with this mode set, the result is simply an error. You could use this to ensure that a request is always being made to your origin."
But somehow, moz-extension//{UUID} and file:// are considered same origin when you set this flag.
STR:
Run this script in the background context of any web extension.
var url = file:///SOME/LOCAL/FILE/PATH
fetch(url, {mode:'same-origin'}).then(f=>console.log("read file",f.url)).catch(e=> console.log('Error trying to read file'))
Expected:
Console: Error trying to read file
Actual
Console: read file file:///SOME/LOCAL/FILE/PATH

This isn't exactly unexpected. If the extension has the <all\_urls> permission, it has same origin permissions for file: URLs, so this is pretty much the way it should work.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Why does this ONLY work when you set the 'same-origin' flag.
Also note that this request completely bypasses the sandbox.

Because our fetch support kind of sucks, and if you don't specify same-origin, it tries to treat it as a CORS request.

As far as I recall, extension processes don't have filesystem sandboxing yet, so as long as it doesn't work from content scripts, that's not too surprising.

I mean, that wfm, but then we need to be clearer about expectations here, and this doesn't really explain to me why the add-on has to (apparently?) jump through hoops to read files...

We should, but it's basically blocked on [bug 1246236](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246236 "NEW - Implement local filesystem read/write access."), and figuring out how we want to deal with filesystem access. I suppose we could add an exception, and ignore file: URL permissions for requests but still allow them for content scripts and such, but I'm not super happy about the idea...

They have to jump through hoops to make any cross-origin requests that don't support CORS. Like I said, our fetch() support kind of sucks.

Allowing the ability to read arbitrary files, by default is surprising and hard to justify from a security model perspective. Am I missing something here? Why does fetch() fail, and fetch({mode:'same-origin'}). I was taken completely by surprise about this, and I have been looking at web extensions for months. On one hand we say file:// is forbidden [1] but we do clearly state that match patterns will match on file:/// [2]
Regardless, default access to file:/// that bypasses the sandbox is risky and means extensions undermine the sandbox. At a minimum I think, we need to have users opt-in to extensions being allow to read file: URIs. Something like with a checkbox or menu option in about:addons. (Actually I thought there was a bug on file for that but I can't find it).

There's no default access to file: URLs. Extensions can access file: URLs if they have permissions for those URLs listed in their manifests, which works the same way for file: URLs as it does for other URLs.
For the third time: fetch() can only fetch those URLs in same-origin mode because our fetch() support sucks, and by default it tries to make a CORS request, which file: URLs don't support, rather than a same-origin request that leverages the extension permissions. Requests to http: URLs work the same way.

Right, but we don't tell the user that in the prompt that is shown for <all\_urls>.

Ok I didn't know that - I thought that all content processes had the same rules, except for the one for loading File:// uris.
I guess Jim can clarify there.
In any case, I think we need to \_something\_ here. My preference would be to deny file:// access by default, and allow the user to opt-in. Not sure how complex that is though, so maybe in the meantime, perhaps we should improve the permission prompt to at least advise the user that the extension can read your local files.

Changing the permission prompt is a bit of a rabbit hole with quite a few problems (how do you message people who installed this already, for example). I think we should deny this case, uplift it to 58 (if possible) and work with the ACE team to message affected add-ons.
Then we keep on the course of figuring out, with all the relevant teams, what use cases for file access to allow and how to do that in the future.

I think that's the crux of the problem. Not that extensions shouldn't be able to read files (if given permission it's a valid thing to do in some cases) but that many/most users will be thinking "Web" when they see that prompt and will not expect "rummage around on my disk" to be part of it. That is, do we need to add a "<file\_urls>" permission?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

I think we should probably make the <all\_urls> permission not apply to files, and require extensions to explicitly specify file://\*/. And we should probably require that to be an optional permission.

The question of how we expose local files to be read is a question for a few groups (security, UX, product) and doing it on a security restricted bug is probably not the best way to get to a solution. There's some good stuff here but I think we should probably stick to the focus of shutting off local file access to fetch in this bug and moving the rest of the discussion to a public bug or forum.

I probably have some spare cycles to shut off the file access here if no one else gets to it before me.
I had some ideas about how we can handle files but as :andym mentioned we can discuss elsewhere after this is resolved.

I think this is a bug in our security checks and we probably should not try to paper over them here. This patch relies on this particular bug to work. I think I understand what is going wrong and will post a follow-up comment with details.

So, both 'cors' and 'no-cors' mode reject because we end up calling DoCheckLoadURIChecks() here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/dom/security/nsContentSecurityManager.cpp#724>
This in turn ends up calling CheckLoadURIFlags() eventually which checks URI\_IS\_LOCAL\_FILE:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/caps/nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp#938>
This block ends up failing and the file URL is blocked as intended. Note, this is done \*before\* checking for URI\_LOADABLE\_BY\_ANYONE.
For 'same-origin' mode, though, we do not call DoCheckLoadURIChecks(). Instead we call DoSOPChecks() which basically calls NS\_HasBeenCrossOrigin():
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/dom/security/nsContentSecurityManager.cpp#711>
Which then ends up calling BasePrincipal::CheckMayLoad(). This happily accepts any URL if URI\_FETCHABLE\_BY\_ANYONE is set:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/caps/BasePrincipal.cpp#152>
As Kris mentioned, web extensions set this flag based on manifest data:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/netwerk/protocol/res/ExtensionProtocolHandler.cpp#382>
This seems like a policy or security check problem. I don't think trying to fix this in fetch() is the right place.

|  | |

To clarify what I think is at least one problem:
In the cross-origin security checks we explicitly check for and disallow file URLs. In same-origin security checks we don't do this because we assume they will be cross-origin and fail anyway. The flag breaks that assumption, though.

|  | |

Other same-origin requests I see in the tree which would be able to touch local files:
\* worker scripts
\* HTMLTrackElement
\* Some FontFace loading code
\* nsManifestCheck
\* etc
These probably don't have the simple attack vector of fetch(), but I think we should fix them in a way that addressed them all if we can.

I am not actually following [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"). That "FETCHABLE\_BY\_ANYONE" flag would be on the \_uri\_, not the \_principal\_. Webextensions set that on \_webextension\_ URIs, which doesn't obviously have anything to do with attempts to load file:// URIs.
I have a slightly different question. Why is file:// special? Can extensions use this same mechanism to get at chrome:// URIs or whatnot?
Or put another way, should <all\_urls> basically mean "all URLs that are URI\_LOADABLE\_BY\_ANYONE", as opposed to "all URLs"? That will presumably restrict it to the things users expect....Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

This seems to have stalled, it got listed as sec-moderate but a P1 by the WebExtensions team, so it keeps popping up in triages for us. Should we drop the priority down to reflect the sec- status? Is there anything we can do to help move this forward baku?

No, keep it P1 - this is fundamental inconsistency in the security model. Either we need to fix this, or we need to make it clear that web extensions are allowed to read files from the file system. Web Extension bugs tend to get lower rating due to exploitation being predicated on installing a malicious extension - not a huge barrier, but more than if the issue was web exploitable. So while only being moderate in the scheme of firefox, I'd say this should be a P1 in the context of web extensions.

What's needed to move ahead with this proposal? I don't think the fix for [bug 1427448](/show_bug.cgi?id=1427448 "RESOLVED FIXED - Some web extension API's do not account for shorthand form of file:// url") will necessarily make much of a difference here.

2) require it to be optional

No. <all\_urls> should still match file URLs, and so should file://\*
What we need is a separate setting that allows users to opt into giving an extension access to local files, similar to what Chrome does. I don't particularly care when/where we prompt users to opt into this, but the status of that permission should at least be displayed on the add-on's about:addons detail page, and be togglable there.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Which means adding a new boolean flag to WebExtensionPolicy[1] and checking it in MatchPattern[2]. Which probably means adding an optional policy property to MatchPattern instances.

We just spoke about this at all hands, and as asked Im adding my strong support for the approach suggested by Kris above (i.e. a toggle where users can OPT IN to allowing extensions to have file access, and prevent access in the regular case).

With a side note that, in addition to preventing direct loading of file:// uris, we also need to prevent extensions open in tabs with file:// URIs (and then injecting a content script into it). From a discussion here it sounds like we don't want to still allow extensions even without the "file access" granted to inject content scripts into tabs with File:// uris that the USER opened. (im not super pumped about that, but it sounds also you shouldn't have to grant a random extension access to your file system, just so that it can inject some content script into the one specific document you opened from the file system.

> I'm going to handle the back-end portion of this.
Does "this" mean to prevent content script file:// access by default \_AND\_ to implement "a toggle where users can OPT IN to allowing extensions to have file access"?
I'm asking because the first "fix" will break Tampermonkey's ability to install scripts from local file URIs unless content scripts that are defined at the manifest are exempted from this change.
Thanks, Jan

Do we want this as a new "public" permission, or just an internal flag that extension can never request, and can only be manually toggled though the UI?
And what should we do with already installed extensions in either case?

I don't understand this the way it's worded. And it seems all of the discussion in this bug is about direct access to reading local files, content scripts are a separate issue, and can be a separate bug.

This can be done in a separate public bug, if it needs to involve UX and/or others, right?

Sorry, my comment is barely readable. I meant that we should have a holistic approach to restricting file system access. If we close this fetch hole, but still allow extensions to open and interact with tabs which have a file:// url open, then extensions will still have read access to the file system (since file: uris are treated as same-origin as files in the same directory). But you are right, that perhaps should be a separate bug.

I'm confused by this bug; the docs describe a function to check this capability: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/extension/isAllowedFileSchemeAccess> and describe "the user-controlled 'Allow access to File URLs' checkbox" (on <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/extension#getURL()> )

Are the docs incorrect or has much of what has been discussed in this bug been implemented?

That currently only applies to Chrome, who we inherited this API from.

1. manifest.json with

```

    "version": "1",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "background": {"scripts": ["bg.js"]},
    "permissions": ["file:///*"]

```

2. bg.js

```
async function test() {
    let r = await fetch('file:///etc/passwd', {mode:'same-origin'});

So, I am still unable to reproduce this on osx regardless of the privacy.file\_unique\_origin value. However, on a fresh profile, same extension, I can reproduce this on linux. Either it is unrelated to file\_unique\_origin or it is linux specific. Due to this, I'll set my vm to dealing with windows for the rest of the afternoon.

So the `fetch('file:///etc/passwd')` call happens in a content process. The triggering principal (and loading principal) for the fetch is a ContentPrincipal with the URI `"moz-extension://01cf4af3-f9f4-4f63-8222-1f2c1db5bffb/_generated_background_page.html"`.

We end up in `ContentPrincipal::MayLoadInternal` and the `AddonAllowsLoad` call there returns true, because the `WebExtensionPolicy::CanAccessURI` call returns true. Given the manifest claims `"file:///*"` in the permissions this doesn't seem surprising, right? Anyway, that means `BasePrincipal::CheckMayLoad` returns true, and that's our general "Should this principal be considered same-origin with this URI?" method. So we consider this a same-origin load (e.g. `NS_HasBeenCrossOrigin` returns false, so `DoSOPChecks` returns success, so `nsContentSecurityManager::CheckChannel` returns success, so the load is allowed.

After things things Just Work: the fetch successfully opens the `FileChannelChild` channel, that remotes the actual filesystem access to the parent process (which is why sandboxing is nor relevant), etc.

Is there some expectation that given our current code this should *not* work?

`fetch('file:///etc/passwd');` does not load the resource (and neither does `XMLHttpRequest`) - this is desired as explained below.

`fetch('file:///etc/passwd', {mode:'same-origin'});` does load the resource.

They should behave consistently.

`file:///*` is automatically granted when the `<all_urls>` permission is requested, which is very common.

Most of the extensions that request `<all_urls>` don't really need file access.

I'd like to block file access by default unless a user explicitly consented, to protect the general population whose add-ons don't need to access files.

(FWIW, in Chrome `<all_urls>` also includes `file:///*`, but access is withheld until the user manually grants access at the extension management page.)

The patch in [comment 60](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c60 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files") seems fine, but I want to understand answers to a few questions beforehand:

1. This proposed fix is different than the agreed consensus in most of this bug, up to and including your second-to-last [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c58 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), which was putting this access behind a special permission prompt/checkbox. Why did you change your approach? Given recent urgency in [bug 1598946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598946 "ASSIGNED"), should we bundle the two bugs together, behind the same optional permission?
2. Why doesn't this work on MacOS? Is it a recent "regression", or some configuration/platform difference?
3. I'm looking up code related to [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), perhaps this cross-origin check should be lower in the chain to cover more than just addons usecase.

I implemented it like this because it fixes file:-access related bugs without breaking known supported cases.

We probably still want to support a prompt/checkbox, but that requires more efforts and review/feedback cycles. That fits better in [bug 1598946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598946 "ASSIGNED") or a follow-up to that bug (and some of the ideas expressed here already align with the tentative plan).

> 2. Why doesn't this work on MacOS? Is it a recent "regression", or some configuration/platform difference?

The paths that we tested were blocked by the sandbox on macOS. If I choose a [whitelisted location](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/efdf9bb55789ea782ae3a431bda6be74a87b041e/security/sandbox/mac/SandboxPolicyContent.h#70), e.g. `file:///usr/share/` , then the load is still accepted.

> 3. I'm looking up code related to [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), perhaps this cross-origin check should be lower in the chain to cover more than just addons usecase.

I'm not aware of any other generic file:-whitelisting other than extensions. Judged by extension permissions only, `file:`-access should have been allowed (and is so, according to `WebExtensionPolicy::CanAccessURI`). But we don't have a separate permission warning or any other obvious indication that an extension is allowed access to local files, so it was a nice "feature" that `file:`-URLs were somehow already blocked access (through `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest`) despite being allowed by `CanAccessURI`. The patch changes the implementation of `CanAccessURI` to match the current default behavior for cors-fetches, and does it at that place to cover most scenarios (without affecting content scripts, for which we want to continue supporting access). If we ever decide to open up file:-access (rather than restricting it), then we probably need to revisit the implementation, but until then, I'd rather be on the safe side.

I think that file:-access to extensions can be a useful feature in some cases, but it should by no means be the silent default behavior.

What's your advice on landing the patches?

I want to land two patches, the fix itself, and unit tests that verifies that the supported behaviors are still working as intended.

Do you think that it is fine to land the following at the same time:

* <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54541> (tests that already passed before the fix)
* <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54540> (fix itself)

(and the regression test in the future - <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54543> ).

... or should I only land the fix now, and land the tests later?

One interesting point to consider is that the bug itself has been public for over two years by now:

I checked all public add-ons on AMO, and the following add-ons are relying on this bug / "feature". I've listed the number of users and the use cases:

* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/> 323k users
  + To import local files in scripts: <https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/347>
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3download-statusbar/> 82k users (recommended badge)
  + To read files for checksum calculations and image preview.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/> 77k users (recommended badge)
  + To support installation of local user styles: <https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/pull/134>
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/exif-viewer/> 35k users
  + Used to view metadata of local files.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/> 7k users
  + Used to automatically update by reading from a local file.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/surfingkeys_ff/> (version <= 0.9.41) 1k users
  + Used to read settings from a local file: <https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/pull/891>
  + Author removed the code in the latest versions (including 0.9.57) when they discovered that the functionality does not work on macOS.
* and a couple of smaller ones.

The total number of users is about 500k. Since the functionality is already not working on macOS, and the loss of use cases is not extremely critical, I'll land the patch that disables local file access, next week.

Many of those affected addons would be better served with `<input type=file>`, it seems.

Doesn't feel like the kind of change we'd want to land on an ESR branch, but should we consider uplifting this to Beta for Fx73?

This vulnerability has been public for multiple years, and consequently some extensions rely on it for legitimate reasons. I want to let it ride the trains to give add-on developers the opportunity to work with the limitations.

Verified fixed using the fileaccess.xpi extension provided in [comment 53](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c53 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files") On Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, MacOS Catalina 10.15 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on FF 74.0a1 (20200121215203).

Checked through loading the extension from about debugging and inspecting it on a fixed version and also installing it (after setting xpinstall.signatures.required to false) in about:addons on a Nightly build from before the push and then upgrading the browser.

A security error declaring that data may not be loaded from "file:///etc/passwd" is logged in the extension console log after the fix.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_11\_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/65.0.3315.3 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Hello. I am Avi Drissman on the Chrome security team. While investigating a security issue in Chrome, I found that Firefox is also vulnerable. The issue is <https://crbug.com/776418> . While I'm happy to allow any Firefox security people access to that bug, I will explain the issue entirely in this bug.
When you take a page in Chrome into fullscreen, a bubble is shown at the top of the screen, saying "hey, you're in fullscreen, tap the escape key to get out". Chrome considers this to be security UI. Firefox has a similar bubble, and I imagine you consider this bubble to be security UI as well.
Obscuring that bubble would be bad. Therefore, if a page tries to open a popup while it is fullscreen, Chrome drops fullscreen. Firefox has the same behavior, and I again imagine it is for the same reason.
However, suppose a page opens a popup while not in fullscreen. If the page is subsequently taken to fullscreen, and then the page uses window.focus() to focus the popup, the popup is shown on top of the fullscreened page, and it obscures the fullscreen security UI bubble.
I attach a sample HTML page that will allow you to reproduce this behavior.
The original Chrome bug report has a very elaborate reproduction that spoofs Chrome UI to induce the user to click on the original page. Please be assured that limits on user gestures will not help here.
The solution that Chrome will be taking will be to kick a page out of fullscreen if it attempts to do any focusing of popups. Edge already has this behavior, and so I recommend that Firefox adopt this behavior.
In addition, I'm proposing this behavior to be standardized; see <https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/issues/116> .
Please feel free to contact me (avi@google.com/avi@chromium.org) with any questions you may have.

We have a bug on making window.focus() kick us out of fullscreen. Was used as an abuse technique--this fullscreen thing is new to us.

It doesn't seem to me that we do, at least I cannot reproduce this behavior on Windows. There may be some other behavior on other platforms due to certain code path, but I believe it's not intended.
It's not clear to me how the mechanism you proposed would work, or specifically, where should we put the check in when someone invokes window.focus(). I guess there are several options:
(1) kick out any fullscreen document when anyone invokes an effective window.focus()
(2) kick out any fullscreen document of an origin when another window of that origin is raised by an effective window.focus()
(3) kick out fullscreen document when anything in the stack calling into window.focus() is related to that document
So, 3 is complicated, and not enough, because one can always ask other document to do this in an async way, although that may be rejected by the popup abuse protection we have for window.focus(), but nothing in the spec really stops it from happening.
(1) and (2) seem to be too strict to me. I think there are valid usecase for a fullscreen document to open a popup or something like that, e.g. when you are doing presentation, and you want to show another page in a new window.
IIUC, the problem we want to solve is that, the security UI should not be blocked by anything when we show it. In that sense, I think we can solve it in an easier way:
\* when we about to show the security UI, we check that we do have the focus, if not, kick the document out from fullscreen, and
\* when the notification is on screen, if we lose the focus, kick the document out from fullscreen.
That should solve the security concern here without adding much complexity to the platform logic, I believe. And the spec just need to make developers aware in the section of "Security and Privacy Considerations".Flags: needinfo?(xidorn+moz)

Restricting it to the same origin wouldn't stop abuse -- easy to make sure the other window is on a different but confederate domain.

I've done some testing and also implemented this behaviour by listening for the `blur` event. However this can interfere with normal usage. For example, opening a Video in fullscreen and then doing something on a secondary monitor would cause the browser to leave fullscreen.

I think the approach Chromium uses, to leave fullscreen on `window.open()` and also on `window.focus()` might be a good solution. Alternatively we could only behave this way while the fullscreen warning is shown.

It might be a good solution but I also think there can be reasonable usecase triggering this. A imaginary case, for example, if user is watching a sample movie in fullscreen, and when it comes to part requiring payment, the website may pop up a payment window, and when the payment finishes, user can continue the movie in fullscreen.

> Alternatively we could only behave this way while the fullscreen warning is shown.

That's exactly what I meant.

Apologies for the delayed update on this. I've looked into various options and also submitted a patch, but I'm not happy with it yet. Only leaving fullscreen when the fs warning is on screen requires a lot of refactoring, since we only know about the fs warning state in the frontend. The event has to be passed all the way through the focus manager to the frontend code. This includes extending the webidl interfaces to pass caller type (if the open/focus was triggered by the website or the system).

Going for Chromiums approach and exiting fullscreen on `window.open` and `window.focus`, would make for a much cleaner patch. We could handle everything in the backend. It would also help with other 'evil traps' where websites abuse popups in fullscreen to trick users into installing addons ([Bug 1596189](/show_bug.cgi?id=1596189 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Website opens popups in fullscreen and tricks user into installing add-on")).

While there are some valid use cases for popups in fullscreen this wouldn't fully break workflows. Websites are aware of the fullscreen state and can avoid this behavior; given the market share of Chromium based browsers they already do. An example use case is Google Slides, where the user can open speaker notes in a popup. In Chromium, if the notes window is opened while in (DOM) fullscreen, the fullscreen is cancelled and the user has to enter it again. That's an extra click.

Dan, Tom suggests in [bug 1596189 comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1596189#c17 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Website opens popups in fullscreen and tricks user into installing add-on") that we should open up this bug and I think it makes sense. The patch is public and I think since the projected attack is mostly about spoofing or irritating the user, there's no risk of an "active exploit" appearing in the small window of time until the fix hits release. It made sense to keep it sensitive while the time to fix was unknown but now I don't think we're at risk.

If you agree, can you open this up, please?

I have attempted verification with the "fullscreenpopuptest.html" attachment using the following steps:

1. Open browser.
2. Load the attachment (login to Bugzilla required).
3. Make sure that the browser window is on the primary screen (if more than one is being used).
4. Click on the "Make pop-up" button.
5. Click on the "Toggle fullscreen" button.
6. Click on the "Focus pop-up" button.

   Affected: The pop-up window is displayed and overlaps the full-screen related notification.

   Fixed: The pop-up window DOES NOT overlap the full-screen related notification. However, the user is forced to leave full-screen mode.

These are my results on Nightly v74.0a1 from 2020-01-31:

* Windows 10: The pop-up window DOES NOT overlap the full-screen related notification. However, the user is forced to leave full-screen mode. **Also, in this case, the pop-up does not stay in focus because the normal window gets focused after leaving full-screen mode.**
* Ubuntu 18.04: The pop-up window DOES NOT overlap the full-screen related notification. However, the user is forced to leave full-screen mode. Also, in this case, the pop-up will stay in focus (as seen in the Chrome browser).
* Mac OS 10.14.6: The pop-up window DOES NOT overlap the full-screen related notification. However, the user is forced to leave full-screen mode. **Also, in this case, the pop-up does not stay in focus because the normal window gets focused after leaving full-screen mode.**

Should a new bug be logged for the secondary issue seen on Windows 10 and Mac OS?

Hsin-Tsai, I am requesting information from you in hope that you could answer some questions regarding the fix. Which are:

One issue that I observed is that the browser will instantly leave the full-screen mode when the pop-up is focused, but I am assuming that this is the compromise we are making in favor of not covering the notification about exiting full-screen. Can you confirm this is a valid approach?

A second issue is that the pop-up that gets focused will lose its focus because the "normal" browser window will be focused when leaving full-screen mode. This issue occurs only on Windows and Mac OS. Is this a valid issue? Should it be logged?

Thanks for verifying the fix!

Yes, this is the approach we opted for. See discussion above.

> A second issue is that the pop-up that gets focused will lose its focus because the "normal" browser window will be focused when leaving full-screen mode. This issue occurs only on Windows and Mac OS. Is this a valid issue? Should it be logged?

Yes, that's a bit inconsistent. The behavior on Linux is the correct one, we should honor the focus request, so the window should be in focus after leaving fullscreen. I've filed [Bug 1613065](/show_bug.cgi?id=1613065 "RESOLVED FIXED - Popup focus request not honored when called from fullscreen").

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
