Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6810:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided content includes the following description for CVE-2020-6810:
     "After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks."
   - This matches the official CVE description, so the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability arises because focusing a popup window, after a website enters fullscreen mode, could obscure the fullscreen notification.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Incorrect layering/focus management:** The browser's UI failed to properly prevent a popup window from obscuring the fullscreen notification.
   - **Potential for spoofing:** The obscured fullscreen notification could allow an attacker to spoof the browser's chrome elements and trick the user into thinking they are on a legitimate site.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **User confusion:** Users could be confused about the actual origin of the page, as the security notification is hidden.
   - **Credential theft:** The spoofed chrome, combined with the user's confusion, could lead to credential theft or other similar attacks that rely on the user's trust in the UI.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Website in fullscreen:**  The attacker's website needs to first enter fullscreen mode.
   - **Popup manipulation:** The attacker's website needs to open a popup window.
   - **Focus manipulation:** The attacker needs to use JavaScript (`window.focus()`) to bring the popup window in focus when the website is in full screen mode, thus overlaying the full screen notification.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Ability to control website content:** The attacker must be able to control the website's HTML and JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
   - **User interaction to enter fullscreen:** The attacker needs the user to put the attacker's website into fullscreen mode for the attack to work.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report ([Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)) provides a detailed discussion of the vulnerability, potential fixes, and the final implementation.
- The fix involved making the browser exit fullscreen mode when a popup is focused using `window.focus()` or when a popup is opened using `window.open()`.
- The vulnerability was present in Firefox before version 74.
- The bug report mentions that Chrome and Edge implemented similar behavior to prevent such spoofing attacks.
