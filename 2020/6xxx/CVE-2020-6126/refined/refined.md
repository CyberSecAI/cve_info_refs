The content is related to CVE-2020-6126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `CoursePeriodModal.php` page, specifically within the `course_period_id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89) in the `course_period_id` parameter of the `CoursePeriodModal.php` page.
- The `id` and `meet_date` parameters in the same page are also vulnerable to SQL injection (CVE-2020-6127 and CVE-2020-6128, respectively).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the underlying database. This could lead to:
- Data exfiltration.
- Data modification or deletion.
- Potential complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `CoursePeriodModal.php` page, by manipulating the `course_period_id`, `id`, or `meet_date` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
