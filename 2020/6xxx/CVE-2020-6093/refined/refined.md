The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2020-6093.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper error handling between the Javascript execution engine (Mozilla's Spidermonkey) and the native bindings in Nitro Pro PDF. Specifically, when a malformed JavaScript object is parsed, Spidermonkey raises an error, triggering an error handler in the native code. This error handler attempts to use uninitialized or freed memory when formatting an error message, leading to an information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Access of uninitialized pointer: The `JSErrorReport` object, passed to the error handler, contains pointers to uninitialized or freed memory locations.
*   Improper error handling: The application fails to properly handle errors raised by the JavaScript engine, leading to the use of invalid memory.
*   Information disclosure: The vulnerability allows for the potential leakage of heap memory contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Information disclosure: The primary impact is the disclosure of potentially sensitive information about the heap layout. This information could be used to bypass exploit mitigations, although the report does not demonstrate this.
*   Denial of Service (crash): Under certain circumstances (e.g. with PageHeap enabled), the vulnerability leads to a crash during error handling, resulting in a denial of service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A specially crafted PDF document containing a malformed Javascript object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to create a malicious PDF file and convince the victim to open it.
*   No special privileges are needed, just the ability to get the user to open the malicious file.
