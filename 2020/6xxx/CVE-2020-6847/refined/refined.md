  "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it in a modal, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user submits a chat message containing JavaScript code. An administrator then attempts to delete that message, triggering the XSS vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit chat messages. An administrator needs to attempt to delete the malicious message for the XSS to trigger."
