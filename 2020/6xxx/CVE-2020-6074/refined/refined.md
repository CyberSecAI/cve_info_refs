The content is related to CVE-2020-6074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the PDF parser of Nitro Pro due to improper handling of nested pages in a PDF document. Specifically, a page buffer can be freed prematurely while still referenced by the PDF object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: A page buffer is freed but a pointer to it remains in the PDF object. This can lead to memory corruption when the pointer is later dereferenced.
- Improper memory management: The application does not correctly handle the lifecycle of page buffers within nested PDF structures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- Arbitrary code execution: By manipulating the heap and exploiting the use-after-free, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code.
- Memory corruption: Triggering the use-after-free can corrupt memory, potentially leading to application crashes or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF file: An attacker provides a specially crafted PDF document containing nested pages and a mismatch between the declared page count and the actual number of pages. This triggers the premature free of a page buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to a user of the vulnerable software.
- The user needs to open the malicious PDF file with the vulnerable version of Nitro Pro (13.9.1.155).
