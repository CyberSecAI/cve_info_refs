  "CVE-2020-6777": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web-based management interface of Bosch PRAESIDEO and PRAESENSA is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An authenticated attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious script code that will be executed in the browser of another user when they log into the management interface.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can interact with the management interface with the privileges of the victim. However, the attacker already needs admin privileges, so there is no additional impact on the management interface itself.",
    "Attack vectors": "An authenticated remote attacker with admin privileges injects malicious script code into the web-based management interface. The script is then executed when another user logs in.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have admin privileges on the affected system."
