The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6118.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. Specifically, the `bmonth` parameter, along with other parameters, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). The application fails to neutralize special elements used in an SQL command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other forms of unauthorized access and control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page. The attacker manipulates the vulnerable parameters (e.g., `bmonth`) within the request to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application in order to make the request to the vulnerable page, indicating that this is not an anonymous exploit.
