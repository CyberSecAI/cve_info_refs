The provided content is a detailed vulnerability report for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2020-6150.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs during the decompression of the `SPECS` section within a Pixar OpenUSD binary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code reads a size value (`pathIndexesSize`) from the file, which is used to read data into a buffer allocated based on a different value (`numSpecs`). If `pathIndexesSize` is larger than the allocated buffer size, it causes a heap overflow.
- **Lack of size validation:** The code does not validate if the size read from the file (`pathIndexesSize`) is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can cause the application to crash, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious USD file:** The attack vector is a specially crafted malicious USD file.
- **User interaction:** The victim has to open the malicious file in an application using the vulnerable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the victim with a crafted USD file.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the system. They simply need to get the user to open the crafted file.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `pxr/usd/usd/crateFile.cpp` when parsing the `SPECS` section of a USD file.
- The code reads `numSpecs` and allocates a buffer. Then reads `pathIndexesSize` from the file and uses it as the read size for `ReadContiguous`, leading to the heap overflow if `pathIndexesSize` is larger than the allocated buffer.
- The crash information shows the crash occurring in `libsystem_platform.dylib` due to memory corruption. The register values show attacker controlled values.
