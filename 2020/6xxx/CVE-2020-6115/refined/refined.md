- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the cross-reference table repairing functionality of Nitro Pro. When searching for an object identifier in a malformed PDF document, the application saves a reference to the object's cross-reference table entry inside a stack variable. If the referenced object identifier is not found, the application may resize the cross-reference table, which can change the scope of its entry. Later, when the application tries to reference the cross-reference entry via the stack variable, it accesses memory belonging to the recently freed table, causing a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416). The vulnerability stems from improper handling of memory after a cross-reference table is reallocated.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to code execution in the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted malicious PDF document is delivered to and opened by the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PDF document to the victim. The victim needs to open the crafted PDF document using a vulnerable version of Nitro Pro.
