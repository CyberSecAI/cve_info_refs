The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Details

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60

and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these

passwords would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, obtain sensitive information,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-20503](/security/CVE-2019-20503), [CVE-2020-6798](/security/CVE-2020-6798), [CVE-2020-6800](/security/CVE-2020-6800),

[CVE-2020-6805](/security/CVE-2020-6805), [CVE-2020-6806](/security/CVE-2020-6806), [CVE-2020-6807](/security/CVE-2020-6807), [CVE-2020-6812](/security/CVE-2020-6812), [CVE-2020-6814](/security/CVE-2020-6814),

[CVE-2020-6819](/security/CVE-2020-6819), [CVE-2020-6820](/security/CVE-2020-6820), [CVE-2020-6821](/security/CVE-2020-6821), [CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

# Description

When doing some fuzzing, I discovered that it is possible to execute scripts inside <select> element when using innerHTML method. The bug is that the parsing gets broken after injecting <template> element.

Generally, no scripts should be executed inside <select> element, and the only allowed tags seem to be <option>, <optgroup>, <script>, <template>. None of these can execute javascript when called through innerHTML, and the bug seems to be only working in the Firefox within browsers that I tested this on.

# Steps

Reproduction steps (Firefox Browser 71.0 (64-bit), Windows 10):

var s = document.createElement('select');

document.body.appendChild(s);

s.innerHTML = '<svg/onload=alert(/wont\_trigger/)></svg><template></template><svg/onload=alert(/will\_trigger/)></svg>'

I also discovered that the issue is very innerHTML specific and will not work when the element is inserted directly through insertAdjacentHTML, document.write() or

<select><template></template><svg onload=alert()></svg></select> as a HTML code.

# Impact

I don't know what's the biggest impact yet, but I fell that there must a serious bug in the parser that allows inserting any HTML after <template></template> when using innerHTML, even if the element could not be put there otherwise.

Flags: sec-bounty?

Summary: Possible Mutation XSS or DOM XSS → Possible Mutation XSS or DOM XSS in innerHTML method due to incorrect parsing <template>

Thank you very much for this report, terjanq! This is really interesting.

My reading of the spec is that `<script>` ought to be allowed in `<select>` but that's not true. So there's one thing.

Then from looking at the current implementation, it seems that HTML parsing when inside a `<select>` is picky about what to allow and what isn't but starts allowing everything once you have inserted `<template></template>`.

I gather the ending template is resetting parser state but doing it incorrectly.

CCing hsivonen for the parser stuff and annevk for the spec bit (mostly out of curiosity)

> My reading of the spec is that `<script>` ought to be allowed in `<select>` but that's not true. So there's one thing.

Executing `document.write('<select><script>alert()</script></select>')` will trigger an alert, so will when used as a plain HTML `<select><script>alert()</script></select>`. `innerHTML` will also insert a `<script>` tag inside `<select>` element but scripts are not executed when inserted via this method.

Another observation by me is that when calling `document.body.innerHTML = '<select><option>1</option><template></template><svg/onload=alert()></select>'` script will not be executed, so it's strictly related to the case scenario that I discovered.

It seems the ending template element resets the state incorrectly and the parser doesn't remember it was inside a `<select>` element.

Is the problem `<template>` or is this really the same svg-related thing in [bug 1598466](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598466 "REOPENED - mXSS/HTML parser ambiguity with SVG and P nested")?

The problem is `<select>` and `<template>` related.

```
var s = document.createElement('select');
document.body.appendChild(s);
s.innerHTML = '<template></template><img src=a onerror="alert(/loaded/)"/>'

```

The above also triggers the alert.

The first and most obvious thing about `template` end tag processing is that the spec has gained an action "generate implied end tags thoroughly" but we only do the old "generate implied end tags" when that's required. That's unlikely to be the problem here, though.

The more likely cause is that the "reset the insertion mode appropriately" algorithm has gained a variable *last* that we don't have.

We should also fix these, but since these aren't the root cause, not right before holiday without test cases.

I would say sec-moderate and not sec-high, since in general many event handlers may run when using innerHTML.

And [bug 1562581](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562581 "NEW") is about load event handlers on svg, "I'm pretty sure that this isn't actually a security bug".

RyanVM, I do think this should land to all the branches around the same time. Do you know what is the right procedure for that?

Ask sec-approval and other approvals at the same time? (even though sec-approval isn't strictly needed)

If you do the branch approvals up front, you could wait to autoland until they're given (with a comment noting that as the intended plan). From there, uplifts should happen pretty shortly after the patches reach m-c per our usual practices.

That said, we're in RC week at the moment and a new cycle starts on Monday, so you might want to wait a couple weeks if you're worried about an exposure window here.

[Bug 1602944](/show_bug.cgi?id=1602944 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible Mutation XSS or DOM XSS in innerHTML method due to incorrect parsing <template>") - Move setting context to null.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: A template in select can confuse the parser, so a site that relies on the browser behaving correctly could in theory suffer XSS. However, in practice, it's unlikely that a site with proper XSS-avoidance mechanisms would be affected.
* **User impact if declined**: Small possibility of XSS.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: Not yet landed; see [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1602944#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible Mutation XSS or DOM XSS in innerHTML method due to incorrect parsing <template>")
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Very low risk. Nulling out a couple of fields is deferred.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: None.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: A template in select can confuse the parser, so a site that relies on the browser behaving correctly could in theory suffer XSS. However, in practice, it's unlikely that a site with proper XSS-avoidance mechanisms would be affected.
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Very low risk. Nulling out a couple of fields is deferred.

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1609607#c0)• 5 years ago |
|  | |

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1608539](/show_bug.cgi?id=1608539 "RESOLVED FIXED - C-C TB mochitest+valgrind uncovered uninitialized memory access.: |m_headerstartpos| is not always initialized in nsParseMailMessageState::FinalizeHeaders()") +++

That bug is about the following.

--- BEGIN QUOTE ---

The subject says it all

|m\_headerstartpos| is not always initialized in nsParseMailMessageState::FinalizeHeaders()

The unitinitialized reference happens at

<https://searchfox.org/comm-central/source/mailnews/local/src/nsParseMailbox.cpp#1223>

I found this by running xpcshell-tests under valgrind.

If m\_headerstartpos is not properly initialized, literally anything goes.

Header parsing, etc. get all screwed up.

The symptom of strange display of message in a message pane that shows only blank or in the middle of header, etc. could be at least partially explained by this bug. (Maybe not all the cases.)

I detected the issue using valgrind, and then began dumping m\_headerstartpos after I set

```
export MALLOC_CHECK_=3
export MALLOC_PERTURB_=0x5A

```

in my environment. GNU libc malloc fills the uninitialized malloc'ed area with 0xA5.

Thus it is rather easy to find it in an otherwise normal dump.

```
cf. From man mallopt.

       M_PERTURB (since glibc 2.4)
              If this parameter is set to a nonzero value, then bytes of allocated memory  (other  than  alloca‐
              tions  via calloc(3)) are initialized to the complement of the value in the least significant byte
              of value, and when allocated memory is released using free(3), the freed  bytes  are  set  to  the
              least  significant  byte  of value.  This can be useful for detecting errors where programs incor‐
              rectly rely on allocated memory being initialized to zero, or reuse values in memory that has  al‐
              ready been freed.
   ...
       MALLOC_PERTURB_
              Controls the same parameter as mallopt() M_PERTURB.

```

From the [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1609607#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - C-C TB mochitest+valgrind uncovered uninitialized memory access.: MD5 is calculated accessing uninitialized area.") of that bug.

--- BEGIN QUOTE ---

Oh, BTW, I notice that the hash calculation touches uninitialized memory region. The last hunk in the attached diff is for investigating this.

I knew that for a long time. But I let it pass since it is not unusual for some hash functions to

calculate the value using 4 or 8 octets at a time, and thus if we have interesting data which has a length of not multiple of 4, we may end up

accessing the last few uninitialized octets of a word: this happens in zip/unzip operation during |make mozmill| test

and I have suppressed the warning from valgrind after investigation revealed that it is a non-issue.

However, with this uninitialized memory access issue at hand, I investigated a bit more, and I now realized that uninitialized access during hash calcluation MAY end up generating message-ID for a message which does not have it to be attached a non-unique message ID.: that is, the message ID varies each time it is generated because of random data in uninitiailized memory. (Correct me if I am wrong here.)

This may happen when you import a message in an individual file and the message lacks a message ID.

If you include it in multiple folders, the same message will have a different message ID in different folders. So this may not be optimal.

But the practical impact of having the message with different message ID is not that great if I am not mistaken again.

HOWEVER, during investigation, I have noticed a glaring uninitialized memory creation and access in the code which I will report later. I am overwhelmed at what is going on and not sure where the problem begins, even.

Attached patch

[Dump the buffer area when MD5 is calculated for message ID creation.](attachment.cgi?id=9121231&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9121231&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1609607&attachment=9121231)

The code to dump the buffer passed to MD5 creation.

You can see that the hash is calculated using |m\_header.GetSize()| as length, but the buffer contains way too much uninitialized garbage at the end...

Typical dump from xpcshell-tests.:

Note that there are cases where header line's CRLF or LF is completely substituted by NUL (in my dump NUL is printed as NU).

I thought the whole log from xpcshell-tests could be seen in the try-comm-central job.

<https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try-comm-central&selectedJob=285106307>

However, I realized that, in order to get the local log, I had to run the xpcshell-tests with --verbose option since the stderr/stdout output is not shown otherwise AND

serially (not in parallel execution mode) so that the dump is not cluttered up with parallel execution of various tests.

So the dump is not visible in the above job. (BTW, xpcshell-tests log with "--verbose" is so full of suspicious errors/warnings. If we can remove some of them, TB would be more robust, but I digress.)

The dump is close to 60MB. If anyone really wants to see the log, I can upload it somewhere and post a link here.

BTW, it seems that this MD5 calculation is invoked for missing message-ID header case to generate message ID.

This means that A MALICIOUS MAIL SERVER CAN STRIP THE MESSAGE HEADER AND CAUSE THIS UNINITIALIZED MEMORY ACCESS DURING MD5 calculation on TB client. Not sure that could be a security problem albeit non-optimal situation where the same duplicate message (same headers) would end up with different message IDs due to uninitialized garbage input to MD5.

The previous bug in 1608539 of uninitialized m\_headerstartpos is worse since the header area manipulation (and the resulting data stored in DB) can be completely bogus although how that is triggered is not clear yet.

Anyway, the area size passed to MD5 calculation is way too large.

From [bug 1608539 comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1608539#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - C-C TB mochitest+valgrind uncovered uninitialized memory access.: |m_headerstartpos| is not always initialized in nsParseMailMessageState::FinalizeHeaders()") : Slightly edited

I think instead of passing GetSize() of buffer area that stores the header data to md5->Update routine to calculate the MD5 and to generate a missing message ID, we should probably keep track of the ending position (NUL code at the end of the last header line when the headers are parsed and stored.: NEWLINE, CR LF seem to be replaced with NUL in the code. Well, CR LF seems to be replaced with NUL LF ?) and pass the length from the m\_headerstartpos to that position.

However, as the forgotten initialization of m\_headestartpos shows there seem to a can of worms around here.

I think I found the cause.

We should use GetBufferPos() instead of GetSize() when we pass the valid length of the buffer data.

With this I could eliminate the access to uninitialized memory.

However, I have noticed an anomaly in the log.

There are cases when the header buffer ends with a NUL and no NEWLINE at the end.

Majority of the cases seem to end with NEWLINE.

It seems that the code does not uniformly handle the input data that ends either

* LF, or
* CR LF
* missing the above line-ending sequence at all (?).

I think all the above cases should generate the same MD5 signature and thus the same message ID, but

I am running out of steam. Eliminating the uninitialized memory access is the main target for now.

I have verified my local patch works as far as xpcshell-tests is concerned.

For some reason, I have not been able to run mochitest locally (under Debian GNU/Linux amd64).

[Bug 1608532](/show_bug.cgi?id=1608532 "NEW - C-C TB mochitest does not run locally on a linux PC due to an assertion.: GECKO(119773) Assertion failure: !mRawPtr, at /NEW-SSD/moz-obj-dir/objdir-tb3/dist/include/mozilla/StaticPtr.h:51")

To verify the patch, I need to run the mochitest somehow.

However, I am not sure if I should submit the patch to try-comm-central since the patch and the log will be visible to anybody.

Is there a way to restrict the access to the job submission and log because of security concern?

Attached file
[Extracted lines from xpcshell-tests log file with the patch.](attachment.cgi?id=9121390)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9121390&action=edit)

I ran xpcshell-tests serially and with --verbose so that the log files are easy to parse (no output from parallel run will get mixed up.).

The command is as follows.:

```
export MALLOC_CHECK_=3
export MALLOC_PERTURB_=0x5A

TESTDIRS="
comm/chat/components/src/test
comm/chat/modules/test
comm/chat/protocols/irc/test

"
for dir in $TESTDIRS
do
    bash -vx ~ishikawa/bin/nrun-xpcshell-original.sh --sequential --verbose ${dir}
done

```

Then I ran the following command on the log to extra the attached file.

```
egrep "(Failed: |  a5|buffer area|totalsize =|\| Starting|TEST_START)" log1161-xpcshell.txt

```

You can see that there is no longer an uninitialized memory access (the dumped memory area did not contain the telltale a5.

Also, you may notice that there ARE buffer areas that end in a NUL and not LF as is usually the case.

Oh well, while testing, I already submitted a try-comm-central job, :-(

And honestly speaking, I think big underground organizations and/or nation-state parties would have known the problem for a LOOONG time.

I don't think there's a way to submit "hidden" jobs. But, probably not too much to worry about here - without context someone looking would still have to do a lot of work to take advantage of it.

Sounds like it's best to clean up the patch, and get it reviewed and committed.

I wanted to test the patch locally but got bitten with [bug 1609789](/show_bug.cgi?id=1609789 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - C-C TB crashed when two messages are copied from Inbox folder of one account to another account's Inbox folder. \"Do not call the fragment parser (e.g innerHTML()) in chrome code or ...\"") locally which should have been solved by the source tree update.

Once I could run at least xpcshell-tests without ill-effect then I will submit a try server job and ask for an approval.

This patch will include the |m\_headerstartpos = 0| from [Bug #1608539](/show_bug.cgi?id=1608539 "RESOLVED FIXED - C-C TB mochitest+valgrind uncovered uninitialized memory access.: |m_headerstartpos| is not always initialized in nsParseMailMessageState::FinalizeHeaders()").

Hello Chiaki, thanks a lot for your detective work and finding the cause of this bug!

In [bug 1608539](/show_bug.cgi?id=1608539 "RESOLVED FIXED - C-C TB mochitest+valgrind uncovered uninitialized memory access.: |m_headerstartpos| is not always initialized in nsParseMailMessageState::FinalizeHeaders()") you had included a suggested fix for this bug. You suggested that the buffer should be copied to avoid using garbage. I think that shouldn't be necessary.

I think that simply changing the call should be all we need. The has function will only use the amount of bytes that are passed as a parameter, and ignore anything else in the buffer after that number of bytes.

[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: random data used to calculate message id
Although this code reads random data, the data is simply used to calculate a message id. The fix ensures we use only real message properties, making the id calculation stable.
It doesn't seem urgent to merge to stable esr68. It's more of a correctness fix. Letting it bake for a while seems fine.

On the other hand, while not urgent, it's a really obvious fix. I suggest to merge it to esr68, so we can get it off the radar of things we need to track.

#### [#CVE-2020-6794: Setting a master password post-Thunderbird 52 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2020-6794)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

#### [#CVE-2020-6795: Crash processing S/MIME messages with multiple signatures](#CVE-2020-6795)

Reporter
Stephan Lauffer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When processing a message that contains multiple S/MIME signatures, a bug in the MIME processing code caused a null pointer dereference, leading to an unexploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-6797: Extensions granted downloads.open permission could open arbitrary applications on Mac OSX](#CVE-2020-6797)

Reporter
Vladimir Metnew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By downloading a file with the .fileloc extension, a semi-privileged extension could launch an arbitrary application on the user's computer. The attacker is restricted as they are unable to download non-quarantined files or supply command line arguments to the application, limiting the impact.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Mac OSX. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-6798: Incorrect parsing of template tag could result in JavaScript injection](#CVE-2020-6798)

Reporter
terjanq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a `<template>` tag was used in a `<select%gt;` tag, the parser could be confused and allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.
*In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-6792: Message ID calculcation was based on uninitialized data](#CVE-2020-6792)

Reporter
Chiaki ISHIKAWA
Impact
low
##### Description

When deriving an identifier for an email message, uninitialized memory was used in addition to the message contents.

#### [#CVE-2020-6800: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.5](#CVE-2020-6800)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Raul Gurzau, Tyson Smith, Bob Clary, Liz Henry, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*
