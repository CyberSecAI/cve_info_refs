- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted script can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the OpenEnterprise SCADA Server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely. A specially crafted script sent to the server triggers the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted script to the OpenEnterprise SCADA Server. The attack has a high complexity. No specific user interaction is required.
