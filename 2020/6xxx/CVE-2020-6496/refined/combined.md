| [Description](#c0)  Bel Z√©bute    2004-11-24 14:59:43 UTC  ``` dnsmasq can receive a SIGHUP to fluch it's cache and reload the config files while still resolvinf name.  The stop/start approach will temporarely leave the network with no dns server.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Bel Z√©bute    2004-11-24 15:02:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 44678](attachment.cgi?id=44678 "/etc/init.d/dnsmasq") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=44678&action=edit "/etc/init.d/dnsmasq")] /etc/init.d/dnsmasq  Maybe there's a better way to do this. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  basic    2005-08-24 06:08:22 UTC  ``` probably something along the lines of   kill -HUP `cat /var/run/dnsmasq.pid`  is what you are looking for. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Daniel Black (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2005-12-29 02:24:51 UTC  ``` Looks weird but this also works  start-stop-daemon --stop -s HUP -p /var/run/dnsmasq.pid ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jon Portnoy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-01-07 17:39:59 UTC  ``` Whoa, ancient bug.. Fixed now, no revision bump since I think most of our dnsmasq users are capable of using killall -HUP ;)  Sorry about the delay, bug mail tends to get lost ``` |  |
