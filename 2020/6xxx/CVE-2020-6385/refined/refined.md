Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient policy enforcement within the storage component of Google Chrome. This means that the browser is not adequately enforcing its security policies when handling storage-related operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper policy enforcement, which leads to a bypass of site isolation. This implies that data from different websites could be improperly accessed or that one site could potentially interfere with the storage of another, due to insufficient isolation measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass site isolation within the browser, which could lead to:
   - Unauthorized access to data.
   - Injection or modification of stored data of other sites.
   - General compromise due to insufficient storage isolation.
   - Potential heap corruption by further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker crafts a malicious HTML page designed to exploit the insufficient policy enforcement.
- The crafted page is then loaded into a vulnerable version of Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to serve the crafted HTML page to the target user. This could be achieved by hosting the page on a website or by other social engineering methods.
- No specific user privileges are required.
- No authentication is required.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by network interaction, since it involves a crafted HTML page.
- The attacker would also need knowledge of the specific policy enforcement flaw in storage to craft the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers before version 80.0.3987.87.
- The vulnerability can lead to heap corruption.
- The exploit requires user interaction, since the victim needs to visit the malicious webpage.
- SUSE and Fedora have addressed this vulnerability with updated packages.

This vulnerability is rated as having an "important" severity.

**Summary of extracted information:**
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient policy enforcement in storage component.
- **Vulnerability**: Site isolation bypass leading to potential data access and heap corruption.
- **Impact**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data theft, denial of service (through heap corruption).
- **Attack Vector**: Crafted HTML page.
- **Attacker Capability**: Remote attacker can host a crafted HTML page, no authentication required, requires user interaction.
