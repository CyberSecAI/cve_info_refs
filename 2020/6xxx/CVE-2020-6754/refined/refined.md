Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6754:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from dotCMS failing to properly normalize the URI string when checking user access to directories. Specifically, it does not handle directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application does not sanitize or normalize the URI, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences to bypass access restrictions.
*   **Insecure Asset Storage:** dotCMS stores assets under the `webapps/ROOT/assets` directory by default. This location, combined with the directory traversal vulnerability, makes assets directly accessible.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows uploading arbitrary files, including executable ones, into the `/assets` directory, even without proper authorization.
*  **Predictable Temporary File Location:** Temporary files created during uploads are stored in a predictable location under the `/assets` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access files and data stored within the `/assets` directory, potentially including sensitive information, configuration files, and language property files.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** By uploading and executing a malicious file (e.g., a JSP file) under the `/assets` directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URI:** The attacker constructs a URL containing directory traversal sequences to access files and directories outside the intended scope. Example: `http://localhost:8080/234aa/test/../../assets/messages/cms_language_en.properties`
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious executable file (like a JSP file) via the upload functionality.
*   **Accessing temporary files:** The attacker leverages the predictable location of temporary upload files within the assets directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the dotCMS instance.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP requests with crafted URIs.
*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files into the dotCMS instance. This can be done even without authentication.
