### [Issues](/security/known-issues.dot) » Incorrect access control can lead to information disclosure and remote execution

| Issue: | SI-54 |
| --- | --- |
| Date: | Jan 9, 2020, 10:30:00 AM |
| Severity: | Critical |
| Requires Admin Access: | No |
| Fix Version: | 5.2.4 |
| Credit: | Internal Security Team |
| Description: | dotCMS fails to normalize the URI string when checking if a user should have access to a specific directory.  If a dotCMS installation stores its assets under the tomcat's webapps/ROOT/assets directory, then the files and data stored under this directory can be accessed by crafting a uri that traverses the directory structure, like so:http://localhost:8080/234aa/test/../../assets/messages/cms\_language\_en.properties  Additionally, when files are uploaded into dotCMS, it creates a temporary file which lives under the ./assets directory and whose location is knowable.  This allows a malicious user to upload an executable file such as a jsp and use it perform remote command execution with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application. |
| Mitigation: | If you are unable to upgrade to dotCMS 5.2.4 or higher, there are workarounds that can be applied:   1. The dotCMS `/assets` and `/dotsecure` should be stored in a folders outside of the webapps/ROOT directory.  You can configure your dotCMS to load these from external locations in the dotmarketing-config.properties file by setting these variables:  `ASSET_REAL_PATH=/data/shared/assets`  `DYNAMIC_CONTENT_PATH=/data/local` 2. OSGI plugin fix: dotCMS has created an OSGI plugin that normalizes any URI passed to dotCMS which mitigates the issue.  This plugin can be found here: <https://github.com/dotCMS/com.dotcms.filter.urinormalizer>. This plugin can be dynamically loaded into a 5 series dotCMS instance and will mitigate the issue. 3. Add constraint to web.xml: Additionally, if you are unable to move your /assets directory, you can add constraints to your web.xml to prevent unauthorized access to your `./assets` and `./dotsecure` directories, as detailed in this issue:   <https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17835> |

## Description

![@Pd1r](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30740738?v=4&size=48)[Pd1r](https://github.com/Pd1r)opened [on Jan 8, 2020](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17796#issue-546681928)
### Describe the bug

Upload jsp files to control the target server

### Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. uri.startsWith () determines whether uri starts with / asset

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956154-5174a880-3225-11ea-8ddd-8592da8ce9fd.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956154-5174a880-3225-11ea-8ddd-8592da8ce9fd.png)

2. Can bypass restricted access to files under assets, like

   /asdasd/../asset

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956305-bfb96b00-3225-11ea-9eb0-0f23e447868b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956305-bfb96b00-3225-11ea-9eb0-0f23e447868b.png)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956312-c5af4c00-3225-11ea-8b1c-490fe3abcacf.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956312-c5af4c00-3225-11ea-8b1c-490fe3abcacf.png)

3. Upload malicious JSP file here

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956432-1c1c8a80-3226-11ea-9ac6-910ac0af1525.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956432-1c1c8a80-3226-11ea-9ac6-910ac0af1525.png)

4. Get file id

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956791-03f93b00-3227-11ea-9071-a7981bf7b287.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956791-03f93b00-3227-11ea-9071-a7981bf7b287.png)
5. Execute arbitrary server commands

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956812-12475700-3227-11ea-9146-d8c4c478cbe3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956812-12475700-3227-11ea-9146-d8c4c478cbe3.png)
6. Can upload even without authorization

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956844-27bc8100-3227-11ea-8be8-f8de2e9c4246.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30740738/71956844-27bc8100-3227-11ea-8be8-f8de2e9c4246.png)

## Description

![@jgambarios](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/923947?u=f5e008e34e903def0ec8fbd6bbe723a98676dbf7&v=4&size=48)[jgambarios](https://github.com/jgambarios)opened [on Jan 13, 2020](https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17835#issue-549234483)

As part of a series of security improvements we need to add a security constraint for the `assets` folder in the `web.xml` file.

```
<security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
            <web-resource-name>assets</web-resource-name>
            <url-pattern>/assets/*</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
        </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>

```
