- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way the Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B processes the "Request Path" within ENIP (EtherNet/IP) packets, specifically in the handling of "Port Segment" types. By setting the "Extended Link Address Size" bit and providing a large value for the number of link addresses to process, it is possible to cause the device to enter a fault state, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow (CWE-120) related to a lack of proper bounds checking when processing the number of link addresses specified in the Port Segment of an ENIP request path.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The device enters a fault state where all remote communications are stopped, and a physical power cycle of the device is required to regain functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted network request sent via the ENIP protocol. The attacker sends a "SendRRData" command with a maliciously crafted Request Path within the encapsulated unconnected message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the network and be able to send ENIP packets to the vulnerable device to trigger the vulnerability. There is no authentication required, and the attacker does not need any prior knowledge about the device.
