{
  "CVE-2020-6318": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the function modules `RSDU_LIST_DB_TABLE_SYB` and `RSDU_LIST_DB_TABLE_DB4` where dynamic ABAP code is generated using untrusted user input. Specifically, the `GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL` instruction is used with source code built from user-supplied data without input validation or output sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
       "Missing input validation",
       "Missing output sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise by allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary ABAP code.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the vulnerable function modules remotely via the RFC protocol and injecting malicious ABAP code through specific import parameters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable function modules via the RFC protocol and needs to have knowledge about the import parameters."
