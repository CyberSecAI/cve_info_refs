The provided content is a vulnerability report from Cisco Talos regarding CVE-2020-6129, CVE-2020-6130, and CVE-2020-6131. Here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2020-6129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the `course_period_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `course_period_id` parameter of the `CpSessionSet.php` page in OS4Ed openSIS 7.3.
- The `$_REQUEST['course_period_id']` is directly used within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
   - Data exfiltration (viewing sensitive data)
   - Data modification
   - Data deletion
   - Complete compromise of the database server
  - The provided CVSS score indicates low impact for confidentiality and integrity and no impact for availability

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page (`CpSessionSet.php`) with a malicious payload in the `course_period_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the openSIS application.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the application server.
