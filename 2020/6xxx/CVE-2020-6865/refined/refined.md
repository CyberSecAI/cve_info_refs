- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The program fails to optimize the response to a failed request, which allows the caller to view the internal error code location of the component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leakage due to exposing internal error code locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can obtain sensitive information by viewing internal error code locations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a request that results in an error, allowing the caller to view internal error codes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send requests to the affected service and have local access to the system. The CVSS score indicates that low privileges are needed.
