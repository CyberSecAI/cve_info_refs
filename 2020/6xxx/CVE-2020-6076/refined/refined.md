- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the Accusoft ImageGear library's ICO image parser due to improper handling of certain parameters in a specially crafted ICO file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) which occurs during a `memcpy` operation where the size parameter is controllable by the attacker through the crafted ICO file, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption and potentially remote code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to provide a malformed ICO file to a victim that uses the vulnerable ImageGear library. The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to parse the malicious ICO file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted ICO file to the victim. This could happen through various means such as a website, email or shared storage. No special privileges or specific network positions are needed.
