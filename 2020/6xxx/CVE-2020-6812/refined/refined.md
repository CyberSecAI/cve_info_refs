Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6812:

**Root Cause:**

*   AirPods, by default, are named after the user's name when first connected to an iPhone (e.g., "Jane Doe's AirPods"). This default name, which includes personally identifiable information (PII), is then exposed by Firefox to websites with camera or microphone permissions via device enumeration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the exposure of device labels (specifically, the AirPods name) to websites, which inadvertently discloses user's personally identifiable information.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** Firefox's device enumeration process did not sanitize or anonymize device names, particularly for AirPods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Websites with camera or microphone permissions can obtain the user's name, violating their privacy.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** While the direct impact is information disclosure, this could potentially be a starting point for more sophisticated attacks that leverage user information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Websites with Permissions:** Any website with granted camera or microphone permissions could enumerate device names.
*   **JavaScript API:** The vulnerability is triggered by the use of JavaScript API that allows sites to enumerate devices such as enumerateDevices().

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Control:** The attacker needs control of a website that is being visited by the target user.
*   **Permission Grant:** The target user must grant the website permission to access their camera or microphone.

**Mitigation:**

*   Firefox implemented a special case to rename devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods' preventing disclosure of user name.
