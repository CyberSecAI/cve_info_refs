# SAP Security Patch Day September 2020: Critical Patches Published for SAP Marketing and SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP

By:
[Thomas Fritsch](#author)

September 8, 2020

![SAP Security Notes Blog](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/SAP-Security-Notes-20.jpg)

*Highlights of September SAP Security Notes analysis include:*

* ***September Summary***—20 new and updated SAP security patches released, including four *HotNews* Notes and two *High Priority* Notes
* ***Most Critical Patch for SAP Marketing***—Vulnerability in Mobile Channel Servlet allows unauthenticated users to perform tasks related to contact and interaction data
* ***Code Injection Threat***—Serious vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP/ABAP platform fixed

SAP has published 20 new and updated Security Notes on its September patch day. This number includes four *HotNews* Notes and two *High Priority* Notes. It’s important to keep in mind that our monthly analysis also includes SAP Security Notes that were published or updated by SAP **between** August and September Patch Days. Part of these additional notes is an update on SAP *HotNews* Note #[2890213](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2890213) [CVE-2020-6207] titled, “Missing Authentication Check in SAP Solution Manager” and scored with CVSS 10.0. The update contains only minor text changes that do not require any customer action. Nevertheless, it can be seen as a friendly reminder to check if you have already applied the patch since its first publication in March 2020. [Details can be found here](https://onapsis.com/blog/sap-security-notes-mar-2020).

Another SAP *HotNews* note that was already updated at the end of August is SAP Security Note #[2622660](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2622660) which contains the newest version of SAP Business Client. This version includes Chromium 84.0.4147.105 which fixes one critical and 13 *High Priority* vulnerabilities in the browser software. The CVSS score of this recurring SAP Security Note remains 9.8 which represents the maximum CVSS score of all fixed vulnerabilities in SAP Business Client that were ever patched with this note.

## In Focus: SAP Marketing Mobile Channel Servlet

The Mobile Channel Servlet is an integral part of the technical infrastructure that is required to realize mobile campaigns in SAP Marketing. Mobile campaigns provide offers and notifications that are sent as mobile push notifications to either Android or iOS devices. These mobile push notifications are routed via Google Firebase.

For inbound activities like user registrations, the mobile device needs to connect to the SAP Hybris Marketing Cloud system. Therefore, the SAP mobile SDK must be installed on the mobile devices and the Mobile Channel Servlet has to be deployed on SAP Cloud Platform:

![sap security notes september 2020](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/SAP-Security-Notes-September.png)

SAP Security Note #[2961991](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2961991), tagged with a CVSS score of 9.6, patches a vulnerability in the Mobile Channel Servlet that allows an authenticated attacker to invoke certain functions that are restricted. An exploit of the vulnerability enables an attacker to perform tasks related to contact and interaction data. As a workaround, if applying the patch is not possible, customers can disable the servlet. A detailed description of how to disable the servlet can be found in SAP Security Note #[2962970](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2962970). Other valuable information is provided with SAP Security Note #[2963056](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2963056).

## Code Injection Threat on ABAP Servers

The set of four *HotNews* notes is completed by SAP Security Note #[2958563](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2958563) and is tagged with a CVSS score of 9.1. This note provides a patch for a Code Injection vulnerability in the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and SAP ABAP Platforms, enabling an attacker to take complete control of the application, including viewing, changing or deleting data by injecting code into the working memory which is subsequently executed by the application. It can also be used to cause a general fault in the application causing it to terminate. Important to know:

* Only ABAP Servers on DB4 or Sybase are vulnerable
* The vulnerability scenario is **not** relevant to SAP ABAP for Cloud Environment and the described attack cannot be executed in SAP cloud products

## Other Critical SAP Security Notes in September

Minor updates on two *High Priority* Notes were published.

SAP Security Note #[2941667](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2941667), tagged with a CVSS score of 8.3, was initially published on [August Patch Day](https://onapsis.com/blog/sap-security-patch-day-august-2020-sap-knowledge-management-affected-two-critical-patches) and describes another Code Injection vulnerability on ABAP servers. The update contains additional dependency information for SAP NetWeaver 7.0 and 7.01.

The second *High Priority* note, SAP Security Note #[2912939](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2912939), tagged with a CVSS score of 7.6, only contains textual changes to the “Solution” section and does not require any customer action.

## Summary & Conclusions

SAP’s September Patch Day is a more calm one. Three of the six *HotNews* and *High Priority* notes only contain more or less negligible update information that does not require customer action (compared to the initial/previous version of the notes). The two *HotNews* notes #[2961991](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2961991) and #[2958563](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2958563) only affect a small number of SAP customers (SAP Marketing, SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP on DB4 or Sybase). That gives enough time to check the status of all relevant security patches in your SAP systems.

# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0001: [CVE-2020-6207] - Unauthenticated
RCE in SAP all SMD Agents connected to SAP SolMan

## Impact on Business

A malicious unauthenticated user could abuse the lack of authentication
check on SAP Solution Manager User-Experience Monitoring web service,
allowing them to remotely execute commands in all hosts connected to the
targeted SolMan through these SMD Agents.

## Advisory Information

- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0001
- Vulnerability Submission ID: 819
- Researcher(s): Pablo Artuso, Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:

  - SAP Solution Manager SP004 Patch 0011 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP005 Patch 0012 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP006 Patch 0013 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP007 Patch 0019 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP008 Patch 0015 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP009 Patch 0007 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP010 Patch 0001 and lower
  - SAP Solution Manager SP011 Patch 0003 and lower

  (Check SAP Note 2890213 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-306] Missing Authentication for Critical
Function
- CVSS v3 score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- Severity: Critical
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-6207
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2890213

## Affected Components Description

SAP SolMan 7.2 introduces a bunch of web services which run on top of the
SAP
Java NetWeaver stack. The affected versions have a vulnerable web service
exposed without authentication.

## Vulnerability Details

The EemAdminService/EemAdmin web service endpoint, which is exposed by
default
in SolMan 7.2, does not require user authentication when someone tries to
use it.
As a SOAP endpoint, any unauthenticated attacker just with HTTP(s) access
to the
system will be able to send particular crafted SOAP messages in order to
make use
of the different actions that this endpoint provides.

This web service, present only in the Solution Manager, allows users to
upload scripts
that will be afterwards executed in the SMD agents connected to the
targeted SolMan.
Because of a lack of sanitization, it is possible to craft particular
scripts that
could end up executing OS commands with SMD Agent user privileges.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 2890213 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2890213>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
