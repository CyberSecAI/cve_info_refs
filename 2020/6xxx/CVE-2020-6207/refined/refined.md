Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing authentication check in the `EemAdminService/EemAdmin` web service endpoint of SAP Solution Manager 7.2. This web service is exposed by default and does not require any authentication to use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication for the `EemAdminService/EemAdmin` web service.
*   **Unsanitized Script Execution:** The vulnerable web service allows uploading scripts that are then executed on the SMD agents connected to the SAP Solution Manager. These scripts are not sanitized, enabling the execution of arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Missing Authorization:** A related vulnerability in the LM-SERVICE component of SAP Solution Manager allows an authenticated user with minimal privileges to execute privileged actions, including OS commands, due to a missing authorization check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated attacker can remotely execute operating system commands on all hosts connected to the targeted SAP Solution Manager via SMD agents.
*   **Privileged Actions:** A remote authenticated attacker can execute administrative methods to configure and monitor satellite systems, as well as execute arbitrary code leading to remote code execution.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain complete control of the application, enabling them to view, change, or delete data. It can also cause the application to terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through network access to the exposed `EemAdminService/EemAdmin` web service of SAP Solution Manager via HTTP(S).
*   **SOAP Messages:** Attackers can send crafted SOAP messages to the vulnerable endpoint to trigger the execution of malicious scripts on connected SMD agents.
*   **Authenticated Access:** A related vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user with minimal permissions to trigger privileged actions via the LM-SERVICE component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated RCE:** For the primary vulnerability, no authentication is required. The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable service.
*    **Authenticated RCE:** For the related LM-Service vulnerability, the attacker needs to be authenticated but requires minimal permissions
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Attackers require the ability to craft specific SOAP messages and understand how to develop scripts that execute OS commands.
*   **Knowledge of SAP Environment**: The attacker needs a knowledge of how to access the SAP Solution Manager system and the specifics of the web service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of SAP Solution Manager 7.2
*   The vulnerability is addressed by SAP Security Note 2890213, which includes patches for the affected components.
*   The CVSS v3 score for the unauthenticated RCE is 10.0 (Critical), and the CVSS v3 score for the authenticated RCE is 9.9 (Critical).
*   Onapsis Research Labs discovered and reported the vulnerability.
