The provided content relates to CVE-2020-6789.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path element in the Bosch Monitor Wall installer. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427) vulnerability that leads to DLL hijacking/preloading.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the victim's system within the context of the user running the installer. This could allow an attacker to take full control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory where the vulnerable installer is located and then executing the installer. This could be achieved via social engineering or by exploiting other system vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable installer. They do not need special privileges to do this.
- The user must then execute the vulnerable installer, which loads the attacker's malicious DLL.
