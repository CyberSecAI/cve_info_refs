- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zoom client application does not properly sanitize filenames specified in the `id` attribute of the `giphy` tag within XMPP messages. This allows for directory traversal using characters such as `..`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Path traversal: The application does not validate or sanitize the filename, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary paths.
    - Lack of URL validation: The application follows URLs specified in the `giphy` tag without validation, potentially leading to arbitrary file downloads from attacker-controlled servers.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary file write: An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system, limited by user permissions. This can be used to overwrite existing files, create new files, or create files with specific extensions, although the filename will have "_BigPic.gif" appended.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution: By writing a malicious file to a specific location (e.g., a startup folder), the attacker could potentially achieve code execution, although this may require additional vulnerabilities.
    - Creation of empty files using NTFS alternate streams (Windows): Allows for the creation of files with arbitrary extensions, although these files will be empty. This can be used to change configuration files, affect lock files, or aid in the exploitation of another vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a specially crafted XMPP message via the Zoom chat feature containing a `giphy` tag with a malicious `id` attribute to a target user or group.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send XMPP messages to the target user or group via Zoom chat.
    - The attacker needs knowledge of the target's file system to write files to specific locations.
