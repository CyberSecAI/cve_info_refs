  "CVE-2020-6007": {
    "root_cause": "A type confusion vulnerability in the `CONFIGURE_DEVICES_ReceivedAttribute` function, where an incoming string is mistakenly treated as a byte array, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
	  "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the Philips Hue Bridge, leading to potential control of the device and further network exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Over-the-air ZigBee exploit by masquerading as a legitimate ZigBee lightbulb during the commissioning process."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to transmit ZigBee messages",
	  "Knowledge of the ZigBee protocol",
      "Ability to trick a user into initiating the lightbulb discovery/commissioning process via the mobile app",
	  "Ability to craft specific Zigbee messages and exploit the vulnerability during the commission process."
    ],
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the Zigbee lightbulb commissioning process, after the device has been paired with the Philips Hue bridge. The attack requires the attacker to masquerade as a legitimate lightbulb during the commissioning process. This can be achieved using a custom Zigbee device, such as the ATMEGA256RFR2-XPRO evaluation board used in the research, or by taking over an existing lightbulb. By sending crafted messages during the commissioning process, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability, inject malicious shellcode, and execute code on the device. The shellcode can then be used to further compromise the device and any connected networks. This exploit is complex and involves multiple stages, including crafting Zigbee messages and bypassing several security mitigations."
