Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6412:

**1. Verification of Relevance**

The content from multiple sources, particularly the Red Hat Bugzilla entries (Bug 1801188), the Fedora mailing list, and the SUSE CVE page, confirms that this CVE is related to an insufficient validation of untrusted input in the Omnibox component of the Chromium browser. The official CVE description also mentions "domain spoofing via IDN homographs".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of untrusted input specifically within the Omnibox component of the Chromium browser. 
*   The vulnerability allows for the use of IDN homographs within a crafted domain name that bypasses navigation restrictions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of input within the Omnibox. This allows for manipulated input to bypass security measures.
*   **IDN Homograph Attack:** The specific type of manipulation involves using IDN homographs, where visually similar characters (from different alphabets) are used to craft a deceptive domain name.
*   **Bypass of Navigation Restrictions:** Due to the improper validation, the attacker can create a domain that appears legitimate, bypassing restrictions and potentially leading to a user visiting a malicious site.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Domain Spoofing:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to display a domain name that appears legitimate, tricking the user into believing they are visiting a trusted site when they are not.
*   **Phishing/Social Engineering:** The domain spoofing can be used to facilitate phishing attacks or other social engineering schemes.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** This vulnerability, while not directly code-executing, enables further attacks due to the misleading domain, such as prompting users to enter sensitive credentials.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily over the network as the attacker provides a crafted URL containing an IDN homograph.
*   **Crafted HTML Page:** The SUSE description specifies the crafted input is via a "crafted HTML page." This implies that exploitation could also involve a malicious webpage containing a link designed to trigger this issue when used.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker is remote and does not require any special privileges on the user's system.
*   **User Interaction:** Successful exploitation requires user interaction, as they must either paste/enter the malicious URI or click on a malicious link.
*   **URI Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create a URI which will pass the current validation but lead to a malicious or unexpected domain, such as utilizing IDN homograph characters.

**Additional Details from Content**

*   **Specific Version:** The vulnerability affects Google Chrome versions prior to 80.0.3987.87.
*   **Omnibox Component:** The affected component is specifically the "Omnibox," which is the address bar of the browser.
*   **Red Hat Advisory:** Red Hat has issued a security advisory (RHSA-2020:0514) to address the vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.
*   **Fix:**  The vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 80.0.3987.87.
*   **Upstream Bug:** The upstream Chromium bug is listed as https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=968505

**Summary of Extracted Information**

CVE-2020-6412 arises due to a lack of input validation in the Chromium browser's Omnibox component, specifically regarding IDN homographs. This allows remote attackers to deceive users by displaying spoofed domain names using visually similar characters.  Exploitation requires the user to interact with the crafted URL. Successful exploitation can lead to phishing attacks and other social engineering attempts.
