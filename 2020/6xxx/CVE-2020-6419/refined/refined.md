  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out of bounds read and write in V8",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Out of bounds read",
    "Out of bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Potentially arbitrary code execution. The severity is rated as High.",
   "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the V8 JavaScript engine.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to supply the malicious JavaScript code that triggers the out-of-bounds read and write in the V8 engine. This could be achieved through a malicious website or potentially through other means that involve execution of JavaScript code."
