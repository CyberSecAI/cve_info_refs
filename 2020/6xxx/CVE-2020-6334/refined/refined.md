Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within the SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer's sandbox subprocess.
*   The specific issue is the lack of validation of the existence of an object before operations are performed on it. This leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Use-after-free vulnerability when parsing SKP files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   The code execution occurs within the context of the current process, but at low integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by:
    *   Tricking the user into visiting a malicious web page, or
    *   Convincing the user to open a malicious SKP file.
*   User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability (user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SKP file or lure the user to a malicious web page.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to SAP on 2020-06-11 and a patch has been released.
