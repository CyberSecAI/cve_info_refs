- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper use of the encryption algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cryptographic issues leading to weak encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can perform account credential enumeration or brute-force attacks for password guessing.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access.
