The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6132.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper sanitization of the `id` parameter in multiple PHP pages (`ChooseCP.php`, `CourseMoreInfo.php`, and `MassDropModal.php`) within the OS4Ed openSIS application. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89) due to unsanitized user-supplied input (`id` parameter) being directly included in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to:
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database (e.g., student records, grades)
    - Modification or deletion of data
    - Potential compromise of the application and underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP pages. The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be authenticated to the application to make the requests needed to exploit the vulnerability.
