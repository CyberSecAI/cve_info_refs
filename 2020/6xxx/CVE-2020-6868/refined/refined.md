- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Input validation vulnerability exists in ZTE PON terminal product's web interface when creating WAN connections. The front-end limits the length of the WAN connection name, but this limitation can be bypassed using an HTTP proxy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient input validation on the server-side, allowing for bypass of client-side length restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can tamper with the parameter value, potentially leading to unauthorized modification of the WAN connection settings.
- **Attack vectors:** By intercepting and modifying the HTTP request through a proxy, an attacker can submit a WAN connection name longer than the intended limit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the local network (adjacent) with the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests. They also need to have low privileged access.
