Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6627:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two factors:

1.  **OS Command Injection:** The `mv_backend_launch` function in `cirrus/application/helpers/mv_backend_helper.php` executes shell commands using the `proc_open` function, and it takes user-controlled input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell. Specifically, the `check_device_name` function passes unsanitized input from the "name" POST parameter to the vulnerable `mv_backend_launch` function.
2.  **Broken Access Control:** The `set_start_info` function in `application/core/MV_BaseController.php` allows an unauthenticated user to change the device state to "start" via a POST request without any controls. This is crucial because the vulnerable `check_device_name` function, which is used to pass the injected commands to `mv_backend_launch`, only works when the device is in the "start" state or the user is authenticated as an admin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Unsanitized user input is passed to a function that executes shell commands, allowing for command injection.
*   **Broken Access Control:** The lack of authentication and authorization checks on the `set_start_info` function allows an attacker to manipulate the device state, which in turn can bypass access controls on other functionalities and exploit vulnerabilities like command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the affected device.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining RCE means that an attacker can potentially take full control of the device, install malware, steal data, or pivot to other devices on the network.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can create a new admin user to gain persistent access to the device, including SSH access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the web management interface of the Seagate Central NAS device.
    * One request changes the device state to "start" using the `/index.php/SCSS/reset_start_info` endpoint
    * A second request to `/index.php/SCSS/check_device_name` injects the command using the "name" POST parameter.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target Seagate Central NAS device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Client:** An HTTP client such as curl or a web browser is necessary to send the malicious POST requests to the device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content mentions a Metasploit module was created to automate this attack, adding a new SSH user. The module leverages the broken access control vulnerability to set the device to the "start" state, then it exploits the command injection vulnerability to create a new administrative user with SSH access.
*   The vendor's response to this vulnerability was that the device was meant for local networks, but the blog post refutes this by demonstrating how the vulnerability is publicly exposed on the internet.
*   The vulnerability was initially discovered in December 2019.
*   The exploit does not rely on any user interaction.
* The vulnerability is present in  Seagate Central NAS STCG2000300, STCG3000300, and STCG4000300 devices.
