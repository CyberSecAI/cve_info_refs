Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition within the parsing of SKP files by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer. Specifically, the software fails to validate the existence of an object before attempting to perform operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the software attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the existence of an object before it is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process with low integrity. This means the attacker can potentially gain control of the application and perform malicious actions.
*   **Compromised System:** While running at low integrity, it can still allow an attacker to gain a foothold to do further attacks on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious SKP file designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability. The victim needs to open this file to initiate the attack.
*   **Malicious Page:** Alternatively, the victim could be lured to a malicious website hosting the malicious SKP file, which, when opened by the application, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file that will trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the victim, which requires user interaction. This can be through:
    *   Social engineering, to get the victim to open the file.
    *   Luring the user to visit a malicious page that will trigger the vulnerability when opened by the viewer.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to SAP on 2020-07-01
*   SAP has released an update to address this vulnerability.
