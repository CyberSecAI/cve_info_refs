- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `store_data_buffer` function of the `igcore19d.dll` library due to an invalid cast conversion. A signed 16-bit integer is cast to a larger unsigned integer, leading to sign extension. This results in an incorrect size calculation for a memory copy operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Out-of-bounds write: The sign extension leads to a larger-than-expected loop count when copying data into a destination buffer.
  - Integer overflow/sign extension: The implicit cast from a signed 16 bit integer to a larger unsigned integer introduces a sign extension that results in an incorrect calculation of the loop counter, which results in an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to out-of-bounds write, causing memory corruption. This can result in remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted PNG file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malformed PNG file to the victim. No special privileges or system access is required.
