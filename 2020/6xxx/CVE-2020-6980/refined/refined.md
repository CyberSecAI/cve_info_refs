Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-6980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the cleartext storage of sensitive information, specifically SMTP account data, within RSLogix 500 project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** SMTP server authentication data, if saved in RSLogix 500, is written to the project file without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker with access to a victim's project file can extract the cleartext SMTP server authentication data. This could allow the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the associated email server or systems that utilize the SMTP credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to a victim's RSLogix 500 project file is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where RSLogix 500 software is used and the project files are stored.

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVE has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.0, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a low severity, local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, and no user interaction needed.
- This vulnerability is one of several vulnerabilities discovered in Rockwell Automation's MicroLogix controllers and RSLogix 500 software.
- The provided document also lists mitigation steps to remediate the vulnerability including updating the RSLogix 500 software.
