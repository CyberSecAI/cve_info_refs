Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-6852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Telnet service on the Cacagoo IP camera is enabled and uses a default, easily guessable username and password (`root:cxlinux`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Default Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded, default credentials for the Telnet service. This allows for easy access via brute-force attacks.
*   **Insecure Telnet:** Telnet is an inherently insecure protocol as it transmits data, including login credentials, in plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root-level access to the camera's operating system.
*   **Malware Installation:** The attacker can use tools like *ftpget*, available on the camera, to download and install malware or backdoors.
*  **Network Penetration:** With control of the camera, an attacker can use it as a pivot point to scan and potentially exploit other devices on the same network.
*   **C&C Server:** The compromised camera can be used as a Command and Control (C&C) server, allowing the attacker to issue commands to other compromised devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Brute-Force:** An attacker can scan the network for devices with open Telnet ports (port 23) and attempt to log in using the default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Cacagoo IP camera, either on the same local network or through port forwarding.
*   **Basic Network Tools:** The attacker needs tools like *nmap* to identify open Telnet ports, and a tool capable of performing a brute-force attack against the telnet service. Metasploit is mentioned as one method.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes details of other vulnerabilities discovered in the Cacagoo IP camera which are not related to CVE-2020-6852. These include weak RTSP authentication (CVE-2020-9349) and suspicious network behavior.
*   The document includes recommendations to close the Telnet service, enforce strong passwords, and address the other vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for better IoT security practices.
