The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for a resource in BIMx Desktop Viewer. The application calculates the allocation size by adding the length of the resource data and the length of an associated note. An attacker-controlled length value can cause an integer overflow when combined, leading to a smaller than expected allocation, which leads to a heap overflow when data is written to the buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow in the calculation of the allocation size.
- Heap buffer overflow due to the undersized allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted BIMx file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious BIMx file to the victim. The victim must then open the file using the vulnerable BIMx Desktop Viewer software.
