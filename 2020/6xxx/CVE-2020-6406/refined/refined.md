**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents contain information directly related to **CVE-2020-6406**. This CVE is described as a "use after free in audio" vulnerability in Google Chrome. Multiple sources mention this specific CVE ID, confirming the content's relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a "use-after-free" error within the audio component of Google Chrome. This means that the program attempts to access a memory location after it has been freed.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities occur when a program continues to reference memory after it has been released. This can lead to a variety of issues, including:
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Accessing freed memory can corrupt the heap.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior**: The program might crash or act erratically.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution**:  In some cases, it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this UAF vulnerability can potentially lead to heap corruption, arbitrary code execution, and disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a "remote attacker" using a "crafted HTML page." This implies that the attacker can trigger the vulnerability by hosting a malicious webpage or injecting malicious HTML content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to serve or inject a crafted HTML page to be viewed by a victim using a vulnerable version of Google Chrome. User interaction is required for successful exploitation. 

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome versions prior to 80.0.3987.87.
*   The fix is available in chromium-browser version 80.0.3987.87.
