Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-6798:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from incorrect parsing of the `<template>` tag within a `<select>` tag when using the `innerHTML` method in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird. The HTML parser fails to correctly reset its state after encountering the closing `</template>` tag.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The incorrect parsing allows for the injection and execution of JavaScript code in contexts where it should not be allowed. Specifically, after the closing `</template>` tag, the parser allows any HTML including those with javascript event handlers, to be inserted and executed within the `<select>` tag, which is normally not possible. This enables XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Stealing user credentials, session tokens, and other sensitive information
    - Defacing the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user, without their consent
- **Cross-site scripting vulnerability:** If a website relies on the browser to behave correctly, this vulnerability could be exploited to bypass these protections.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Website-based XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML containing the vulnerable sequence into a web page. If a user loads the crafted web page, the browser's incorrect parsing allows the injected JavaScript to execute in the context of the webpage.
- **Browser-like contexts:** While generally scripting is disabled in email, this flaw could be a risk in other browser-like contexts that use the affected parsing logic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to control webpage content:** An attacker needs the ability to inject or influence the content of a webpage that will be rendered using the affected parsing logic. This could be through various means:
    - Directly modifying a website.
    - By sending a crafted HTML email message.
    - By tricking the user into visiting a malicious website.
- **Understanding of innerHTML behavior:** The attacker must have the knowledge that the vulnerable parsing behavior is specific to the `innerHTML` method, and the sequence `<template></template>` triggers the issue.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability once the attacker can inject HTML content into a vulnerable context.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was identified during fuzzing activities and is specific to the behavior of the `innerHTML` method.
- Other methods like `insertAdjacentHTML` and direct HTML insertion using `<select><template></template><svg onload=alert()></svg></select>` do not trigger the vulnerability, highlighting that it's not a general HTML parsing issue, but one tied to handling of the `<template>` tag inside a `<select>` element within the specific context of the innerHTML assignment.

This vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5 and Thunderbird 68.5.
