- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Online Invoicing System 2.6 fails to properly sanitize user input when adding new clients, specifically in the "Client Name" field. Although the application removes script tags from the user interface, it does not do so before storing the data in the SQL database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database, which is then executed when an administrator views the Reports page. This can lead to session hijacking, where the attacker steals the administrator's session cookie and gains unauthorized access to the administrator account.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to insert malicious javascript code in the "Client Name" field when adding a new client through the application's interface. The malicious code is executed when the administrator accesses the Reports page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to access the "Add New Client" functionality.
