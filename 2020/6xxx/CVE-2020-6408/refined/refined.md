**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient policy enforcement in Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The core issue is a failure to properly enforce CORS policies, which are designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources from different origins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful attack could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information from the browser's process memory. This could potentially lead to exposure of user data, cookies, or other sensitive content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is triggered by a crafted HTML page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML page to the victim. This could be achieved through various means, such as a malicious website or a phishing attack.
*   The attacker is described as "local," meaning the exploit doesn't necessarily need to be triggered from across the internet. In this case, the attacker needs to convince the victim to load the malicious HTML page.
