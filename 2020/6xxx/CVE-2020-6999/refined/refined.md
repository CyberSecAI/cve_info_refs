Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-6999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a classic buffer overflow. Some parameters on the setting pages of the affected devices do not properly validate the size of input text, leading to a buffer overflow if the text exceeds the buffer's capacity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Classic Buffer Overflow (CWE-120): The software does not properly validate the size of input, allowing the attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can cause a denial-of-service (DoS), making the device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack requires a low level of access/privilege (PR:L).
- User interaction is not required (UI:N).
- Exploitation occurs within the same scope (S:U).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the affected device.
- The attacker needs low-level privileges on the device to exploit the vulnerability.
