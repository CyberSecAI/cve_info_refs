Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from an **Incorrect Privilege Assignment** within the mc2 binary of Eaton's Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The IPM software fails to properly validate user privileges before performing privileged actions. This allows non-administrator users to bypass access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a non-administrator user to **escalate their privileges**.
*   This privilege escalation enables the attacker to manipulate system configurations by uploading configurations with incorrect parameters.
*   Attackers gain access to resources normally protected from non-admin users.
*   The CVSS v3 score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), indicating the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system, not necessarily a high privileged one.
*   The attacker needs to send specially crafted requests to upload system configuration files.
*   Exploitation does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be authenticated as a non-administrator user on the system running the vulnerable IPM software.
*   The attacker requires the ability to send specially crafted requests to the mc2 binary.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Eaton Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) versions 1.67 and prior.
*   A patch has been released in version 1.68.
*   Mitigation steps include blocking ports 4679 and 4680 at the network level.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sivathmican Sivakumaran of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
