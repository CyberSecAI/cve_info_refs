Product Description

Eaton’s Intelligent Power Manager (IPM) software provides the tools needed to monitor and manage
power equipment in a physical or virtual environment keeping IT devices up and running during a
power or environmental event. This innovative software solution ensures system uptime and data
integrity by allowing users to remotely monitor, manage and control devices on their networks.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external network for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from open internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices(e.g. firewall, data

diode), and isolate them from the business network.

•  Remote access to control system network shall be made available only on need to use basis.
Remote access shall use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), updated
to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.

•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.

•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DCP, etc.) on the devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier

devices(e.g. firewall, data diode).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of your control systems.
