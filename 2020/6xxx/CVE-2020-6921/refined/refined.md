- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists during the unzipping process within the `UncompressCabFile(..)` function of the HP Support Framework API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability in the unzipping process. The vulnerability is triggered when a CAB or ZIP file is uncompressed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary file creation as the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is possible. When combined with other vulnerabilities, such as DLL sideloading, local code execution as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` from an unprivileged context becomes possible.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker with an understanding of the HP Support Assistant API. The attacker crafts a malicious CAB or ZIP archive with directory traversal paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local unprivileged user with knowledge of the HP Support Assistant API is needed.
