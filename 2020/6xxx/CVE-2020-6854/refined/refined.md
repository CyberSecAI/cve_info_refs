The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability identified in JOC Cockpit, a component of JobScheduler Operations Center. This vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2020-6854.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of JSON input within JOC Cockpit's REST API calls. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize string properties in JSON input, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when processing JSON data. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Inject arbitrary HTML content into the web application's interface.
- Execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
- Potentially perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, leading to data compromise or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious JSON payloads that are submitted through JOC Cockpit's REST API. The crafted JSON data contains HTML and JavaScript code within string properties.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a valid account with privileges to access the vulnerable views within the JOC Cockpit application to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to perform specific actions that involve sending the malicious JSON input via the REST API.
