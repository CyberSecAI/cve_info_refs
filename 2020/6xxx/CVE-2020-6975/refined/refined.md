Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6975:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2020-6975` and its association with "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type," confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is an "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" (CWE-434). The application does not properly validate the type of files being uploaded.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows users to upload files without sufficient checks on their type, potentially including malicious executables.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload a malicious file. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the malicious file, potentially including arbitrary code execution or system compromise. However, the provided CVSS score indicates only a Low impact on Integrity (`I:L`), with no impact on Confidentiality (`C:N`) or Availability (`A:N`).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning the attacker can be remote.
   - The attack requires low attack complexity (`AC:L`).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs to have high privileges (`PR:H`) on the system, meaning the attacker requires high-level user access.
   - The attack requires user interaction (`UI:R`). This suggests that the user with high privileges must perform an action like uploading a file.
