{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-6167",
    "Root cause": "The plugin lacks nonce checks on settings, leading to CSRF vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CSRF",
      "Stored XSS"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could trick a site owner into modifying plugin settings, including injecting malicious JavaScript, enabling maintenance mode, or changing other settings.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted request disguised as a link that tricks a site owner into modifying plugin settings.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Trick an administrator into clicking a malicious link."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-6168",
    "Root cause": "The plugin uses `is_admin()` incorrectly to check for administrative users, which only checks if the request is sent to an administrative page, not that the user is an admin.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Permissions"
    ],
     "Impact": "Any authenticated user (subscriber or above) can enable/disable maintenance mode.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a direct request to the vulnerable endpoint with modified parameters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Must be a logged in user with subscriber permissions or above. Can also use CSRF if the attacker is not logged in."
  },
   "vulnerability_3": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-6166",
    "Root cause": "The plugin uses `is_admin()` incorrectly to check for administrative users, which only checks if the request is sent to an administrative page, not that the user is an admin.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Permissions"
    ],
     "Impact": "Any authenticated user (subscriber or above) can export plugin settings or modify maintenance page themes.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a direct request to the vulnerable endpoint with modified parameters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Must be a logged in user with subscriber permissions or above."
