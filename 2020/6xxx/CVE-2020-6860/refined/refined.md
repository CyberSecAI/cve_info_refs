Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6860:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `readDataVar` function within the `hdf/dataobject.c` file of the `libmysofa` library.
- Specifically, the overflow happens during a `sprintf` or `vsprintf` operation within this function, likely when formatting data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution because the stack buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent stack memory, potentially including return addresses.
- The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output shows a crash during the `sprintf` or `vsprintf` operation, confirming the overflow and demonstrating potential for denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious SOFA file with specific data that triggers the buffer overflow when processed by `libmysofa`.
- The `mysofa2json` tool is used to parse the crafted file, triggering the vulnerability in the parsing process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious SOFA file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libmysofa` library.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to run the `mysofa2json` tool with the crafted file as input.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information is more detailed than the initial CVE description, containing the exact vulnerable function, code file and method to reproduce the crash.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `libmysofa` version 1.2.1.
- The issue was discovered using ASAN, which is a memory error detector.
- Fedora and EPEL updates were released to address this issue.
- The `fuzzme-ops` github user reported the vulnerability.
- The provided ASAN output shows the precise stack frame, variable affected, and memory access underflow.
