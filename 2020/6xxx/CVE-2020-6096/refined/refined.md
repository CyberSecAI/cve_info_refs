{
  "CVE-2020-6096": {
    "Root cause": "The ARMv7 implementation of `memcpy()` in GNU glibc uses signed branch and arithmetic operations on the `num` parameter, which is intended to be an unsigned `size_t` representing the number of bytes to copy. This leads to incorrect behavior when `num` has a negative value when treated as a signed integer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error (CWE-195)"
    ],
    "Impact": "When memcpy is called with a negative value for the 'num' parameter (when interpreted as a signed integer), it results in copying fewer bytes than intended, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory writes, corrupted data, undefined behavior, and potentially remote code execution.  Furthermore, the program may not crash as expected, and subsequent execution and iterations of the code may operate on corrupted data.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can underflow the 'num' parameter passed to memcpy(). This can happen due to logic errors, buffer overflows, or other vulnerabilities that lead to a negative value for the size parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the size/num parameter passed to the memcpy function. This often means exploiting other bugs to manipulate data that eventually becomes the size parameter for memcpy."
