Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability.  If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.  ### Tested Versions  GNU glibc 2.30.9000 ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c1)  jsm-csl@polyomino.org.uk    2020-03-02 21:57:30 UTC  ``` Note that the glibc 2.30 NEWS file contains the entry:  * Memory allocation functions malloc, calloc, realloc, reallocarray, valloc,   pvalloc, memalign, and posix_memalign fail now with total object size   larger than PTRDIFF_MAX.  This is to avoid potential undefined behavior with   pointer subtraction within the allocated object, where results might   overflow the ptrdiff_t type.  Thus any size specified with the high bit set exceeds the size of the  object being copied, so resulting in undefined behavior, so I don't see a  security vulnerability here in 2.30 and later, unless you're claiming it's  still valid to allocate over half the address space in a single allocation  with mmap.  (Of course memcpy is also invalid with overlapping copies, but  there's a de facto GNU extension to allow the source and destination  pointers to be equal.) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c2)  Yves Younan    2020-03-16 18:59:10 UTC  ``` Joseph, the bug is in memcpy, not malloc. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c3)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-03-16 20:19:36 UTC  ``` Has CVE-2020-6096 been assigned to this defect? It shows up the TALOS report attached to this issue. It shows up as reserved by MITRE. Please keep in mind this bug tracker is public.  In general the signed comparison issue looks like it could be used to copy less data than expected, and that's behaviour that could lead to data structures not having their intended value and so effect program control flow. I'm setting security+ because of this issue. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c4)  Adhemerval Zanella    2020-03-16 20:32:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Yves Younan from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c2)) > Joseph, the bug is in memcpy, not malloc.  My understanding from Joseph's reply is that using a value higher than PTRDIFF_MAX for memcpy length is undefined behavior because either for automatic objects or by using memory allocation functions the allocation will fail.   However, I still think it is an issue because we explicit omit mmap from the allocation functions that might fail (if I recall correctly the reason was that some programs do try to allocate more than PTRDIFF_MAX with mmap). It will be still subject to the undefined behavior with pointer subtraction when operating with the object itself, so maybe we should extend the same failure handling to mmap. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c5)  regiwils    2020-03-26 14:24:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c3)) > CVE-2020-6096 is assigned to this issue and will reflect as reserved by MITRE until the issue is publicly disclosed and publishing request is issued to MITRE. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c6)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-03-28 02:36:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to regiwils from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c5)) > (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c3)) > > CVE-2020-6096 is assigned to this issue and will reflect as reserved by MITRE until the issue is publicly disclosed and publishing request is issued to MITRE.

In many cases the implementation chooses what behaviour happens in the undefined case, and it is always better if we crash early rather than to continue to operate having copied less data than expected by the API. If we change the implementation to operate on unsigned values we will eventually reach an unmapped page (likely) and crash. Crashing is the best outcome in this case since it prevents the attack from continuing. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c10)  Wilco    2020-04-07 17:47:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c9)) > (In reply to Richard Earnshaw from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c8)) > > memcpy is only defined if the regions do not overlap.

Assuming we agree values over 2GB are not used in legal programs, then it could only happen if the size gets corrupted by a buffer overflow. If that's the case, an attacker could set it to whatever value they wanted anyway rather than relying on this bug. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c11)  Florian Weimer    2020-04-07 18:07:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wilco from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c10)) > Yes it's better to crash, but I fail to see how it would be a security > issue.

I think the relevant case is when the size is set to -1 (or something else close to zero) statically due to a size computation that went wrong as the result of a logic error, and not some arbitrary attacker-controlled value.  Maybe we can change __memcpy_chk to call __chk_fail if the most significant bit of the dynamic length argument is set, independently of the value of the destination length? Then at least applications built with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE would benefit from that kind of belt-and-suspenders hardening. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c12)  Wilco    2020-04-07 18:50:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Weimer from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c11)) > (In reply to Wilco from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c10)) > > Yes it's better to crash, but I fail to see how it would be a security > > issue.

Compilers warn if memcpy size is constant and over 2GB, so it's unlikely such a glaring mistake would go unnoticed. It would need to be runtime underflow which means you'd likely call malloc to allocate the buffer, and that would fail on -1.  > Maybe we can change __memcpy_chk to call __chk_fail if the most significant > bit of the dynamic length argument is set, independently of the value of the > destination length?

Yes, and it would be even better to check for overlap, that includes this case and would find quite a few real bugs. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c13)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-04-07 20:49:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Wilco from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c10)) > (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c9)) > > (In reply to Richard Earnshaw from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c8)) > > > memcpy is only defined if the regions do not overlap.

We assign a security+ in all issues where the reporter filed a CVE (glibc security policy). The security+ indicates the issue is considered "security relevant" and needs further evaluation (we have 17 such glibc bugs open for review today).  The fact that we have a CVE assigned means Red Hat's security had to work through their own analysis here: <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-6096#cve-cvss-v3>  In the case of low or moderate impact we really need to have other factors to decide to prioritize.  I think we all agree this should crash, and if we can make it crash then that's a QoI improvement.  What is the priority of this fix over other stuff you're working on? That's hard to say, but I would not prioritize this against other bugs and features, and not against the set of "high" or "critical" CVEs since our security teams have evaluated it lower. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c14)  jsm-csl@polyomino.org.uk    2020-04-07 20:58:48 UTC  ``` On Tue, 7 Apr 2020, wdijkstr at arm dot com via Glibc-bugs wrote:  > Yes, and it would be even better to check for overlap, that includes this case > and would find quite a few real bugs.  I think a de facto part of the ABI is that memcpy of an object to itself  (source and destination pointers equal) does work; some GCC versions may  generate that for structure assignment in some cases where it's not know  if there might be such exact overlap but partial overlap would not be  valid (which is the standard C rule for structure assignment).  (GCC won't  let you declare a type occupying half the address space or more, so the  structure assignment case isn't applicable for such a large memcpy.) ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c15)  Szabolcs Nagy    2020-04-08 13:34:12 UTC  ``` note that memmove calls memcpy with overlapping src and dst (if dst < src).  and on an aarch64 kernel a 32bit arm executable with mmap(0, -1U/2 + 4097, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0); can succeed.  so the bug can be triggered by code using mmap and memmove correctly.  however i think relying on memcpy crashing on an overflowed size to mitigate bugs in user code is a weak protection. (and in general we should not guarantee that memcpy accesses all pages in the specified range: there may be a memcpy syscall in the future for large copies with whatever semantics in case of ub) ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c16)  Wilco    2020-04-08 14:09:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to Szabolcs Nagy from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c15)) > note that memmove calls memcpy with overlapping > src and dst (if dst < src). >  > and on an aarch64 kernel a 32bit arm executable with > mmap(0, -1U/2 + 4097, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_ANON|MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0); > can succeed. >  > so the bug can be triggered by code using mmap and memmove correctly. >  > however i think relying on memcpy crashing on an overflowed > size to mitigate bugs in user code is a weak protection. > (and in general we should not guarantee that memcpy accesses > all pages in the specified range: there may be a memcpy > syscall in the future for large copies with whatever semantics > in case of ub)  Still we should have a new test that checks every string function which has a size_t input, using a positive test if the huge mmap succeeds and a negative test checking for a crash. That should flush out any other cases across all targets. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c17)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-04-21 14:35:34 UTC  ``` Patch posted by zhuyan (Huawei): <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-April/112671.html>  There is discussion about how much test coverage is needed. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c18)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-04-21 14:41:27 UTC  ``` Version 2 for review: <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-April/112747.html> ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c19)  Wilco    2020-05-01 13:03:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=25620#c17)) > Patch posted by zhuyan (Huawei): > <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-April/112671.html> >  > There is discussion about how much test coverage is needed.

                 983479 989147 990542

This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
affects character set conversion.

CVE-2016-10228

    The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
    suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
    the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2019-19126

    On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
    LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
    execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
    restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
    thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

CVE-2019-25013

    The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
    over-read.

CVE-2020-10029

    The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
    reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
    non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
    0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
    to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

CVE-2020-1752

    A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
    way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
    an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
    issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
    specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
    would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2020-27618

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
    and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
    lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
    service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

CVE-2020-6096

    An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
    memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
    targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
    value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
    vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
    memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
    writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
    execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
    program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
    or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
    execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
    corrupted data.

CVE-2021-27645

    The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
    processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
    double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
    Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

CVE-2021-3326

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
    the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-33574

    The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
    may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
    its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
    leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
    unspecified other impact.

CVE-2021-35942

    The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
    memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
    untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
    service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
    used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

CVE-2021-3999

    An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
    memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
    attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
    in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
    arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

CVE-2022-23218

    The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
    module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
    without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
    is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2022-23219

    The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
    of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
    validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
    not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.28-10+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1019

## GNU glibc ARMv7 memcpy() memory corruption vulnerability

##### May 21, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6096

### Summary

An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the ‘num’ parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability.

If an attacker underflows the ‘num’ parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

### Tested Versions

GNU glibc 2.30.9000

### Product URLs

<https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-195 - Signed to Unsigned Conversion Error

### Details

The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread\_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

If an attacker underflows the `num` parameter to `memcpy()`, this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this `memcpy()` implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

By definition, `memcpy()` takes three parameters. The third parameter, `num`, is a `size_t` data type that contains the number of bytes to copy (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memcpy.3.html). By definition, `size_t` data types are treated as unsigned integers. The implementation of `memcpy()` for ARMv7 targets does not properly handle the `size_t` data type for the `num` parameter. Instead of treating `size_t` data types as unsigned, the ARMv7 `memcpy()` implementation utilizes signed branch and arithmetic operations while operating on the `num` parameter.

```
269	mov     r12, r0
270	cmp     r2, #64
271	bge     0x405ffcb4

```

At the beginning of the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation, the function parameter `num` (number of bytes to copy) is compared with 64. If 64 or more bytes need to be copied, then program execution will branch, otherwise, execution will continue downward to copy under 64 bytes before returning.

By definition, the CMP instruction will subtract the value of the operand (64) from the register value (parameter `num`, or register `r2`) to generate the appropriate condition codes. If `num` contains a negative value, the `CMP` instruction will result in a negative result, thus setting the negative condition code. The before and after condition codes are shown below.

```
  	  n z c v
(Before)  0 0 1 0
(After)   1 0 1 0

```

Because `bge` is a signed branch (signed greater than or equal), it will not branch if the `n` condition code is set. As a result, when presented with a negative value for `num`, the ARMv7 `memcpy()` function will not take this branch and will continue downward to copy less than 64 bytes.

To exhibit the differences between the `memcpy()` implementation on ARMv7 versus other platforms and the vulnerability, a small test program was written. This program attempts to copy a total of 0xfffffd37 (+4294966583 or -713 in unsigned and signed decimal form respectively) bytes to a location in memory.

```
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct linebuffer {
	int bufsz;
	int nl_pos;
	int len;
	char buf[2048];
};

void do_memcpy(void)
{
	struct linebuffer lb;
	memset(&lb, 0, sizeof(lb));
	memset(lb.buf, 'A', 2048);
	lb.len = 0xfffffd37;

	memcpy(lb.buf, lb.buf + 1024, lb.len);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	puts("before memcpy");
	do_memcpy();
	puts("after memcpy");
}

```

When run on x86 platforms, this program segmentation faults, because the `num` argument to `memcpy()`, 0xfffffd37, is interpreted properly as a `size_t` value (which is an unsigned integer).

When run on ARMv7 hosts, `memcpy()` does not treat the `num` parameter as a size\_t value, but rather as a signed integer. The `num` value of 0xfffffd37 is interpreted as -713 which means only 55 bytes will be copied. Once copied, this program will successfully complete and the program will exit.

### Mitigation

By the `memcpy()` definition, the number of bytes to copy (`num`) is expected to be an unsigned integer. To account for this, signed branch operations should not be performed on the `num` parameter at any point during the `memcpy()` implementation. Instead of `bge`, the unsigned greater than or equal comparison, `bhs`/`bcs`, should be used. This would ensure that the `num` parameter is treated as unsigned.

Several instances were found throughout the ARMv7 `memcpy()` implementation (located in `sysdeps/arm/armv7/multiarch/memcpy_impl.S`) of signed branches being used in place of their unsigned branch equivalents. These instances are chronicled below.

```

Line 354:	blt	.Ltail63aligned
Line 357:	bge	.Lcpy_body_long
Line 381:	bge	1b
Line 415:	bge	1b
Line 485:	blt	2f
Line 497:	bge	1b

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-d860479b2a
2020-07-19 01:08:45.469519
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.31
Release : 4.fc32
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update incorporates fixes from the upstream glibc 2.31 stable release
branch, including a fix for a medium severity security vulnerability.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-4e92a61688
2020-08-02 01:09:07.546626
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.30
Release : 13.fc31
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update incorporates fixes from the upstream glibc 2.30 stable release
branch, including a fix for a medium severity security vulnerability.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-04-02 18:37:20 UTC  ``` An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.  Reference: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25620>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-04-02 18:38:15 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1820332](show_bug.cgi?id=1820332 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-6096 glibc: signed comparison vulnerability in the ARMv7 memcpy function [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-16 16:32:18 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-6096>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-04-16 16:42:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux only supports the 64-bit ARM architecture (AArch64) which does not include the vulnerable implementation of `memcpy()`. Therefore, all versions of glibc as shipped with RHEL are not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-04-17 13:05:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=12334>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1820331#c9)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-03 14:43:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=79a4fa341b8a89cb03f84564fd72abaa1a2db394> <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=beea361050728138b82c57dda0c4810402d342b9>   ``` |  |
