The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6632.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization when adding or removing quick access links in the PrestaShop application. Specifically, user-supplied URLs in the quick access functionality were not being correctly escaped before being output on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, as unescaped user-supplied input is directly embedded in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the quick access links.
- When a user interacts with these links, the injected script could be executed, potentially allowing an attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    - Modify the content of the page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the quick access link URLs.
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code, and then add it as a quick access link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have an account on the PrestaShop platform or be able to manipulate the quick access links through other vulnerabilities or social engineering.
- Ability to add or modify quick access links in the PrestaShop application
