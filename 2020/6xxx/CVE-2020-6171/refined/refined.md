- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `lang` parameter in the CLink Office v2 application is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization. The application also includes a vulnerable version of Horde webmail with known LFI and RCE vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. The presence of vulnerable Horde webmail opens the door to Local File Inclusion and Remote Code Execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious code into the `lang` parameter of the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a victim to access it. This can be done by tricking a user to click the link or through other methods such as injecting the link on a forum/website, etc.
