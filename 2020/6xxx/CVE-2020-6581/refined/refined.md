  "CVE-2020-6581": {
    "description": "Insufficient Filtering and incorrect parsing of the configuration file may lead to command injection.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of the `nasty_metachars` option in the NRPE configuration file. Special characters like newline `\\n` are interpreted literally instead of their special meaning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient filtering of configuration file inputs.",
      "Incorrect parsing of special characters within the configuration file."
    ],
    "impact": "Command injection, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the NRPE daemon user.",
    "attack_vector": "By modifying the `nasty_metachars` option in the NRPE configuration file, an attacker can bypass the intended blacklist of shell meta characters and inject malicious commands via NRPE's command-line parameter handling.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to modify the NRPE configuration file and trigger a check on the NRPE agent. The NRPE service must also be compiled with command line parameter support, and the 'dont_blame_nrpe' option must be enabled in the configuration file."
