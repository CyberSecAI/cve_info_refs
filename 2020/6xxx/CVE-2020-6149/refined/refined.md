The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes details for CVE-2020-6149 along with other related CVEs.

**CVE-2020-6149**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs during the decompression of the `PATHS` section in a Pixar OpenUSD binary file. The code reads a size value (`numPaths`) which is used to allocate a buffer. Then, a different size value (`pathIndexesSize`) is read from the file and used as the size of data read into the previously allocated buffer. If `pathIndexesSize` is greater than the allocated buffer, this leads to a heap overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**:
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   Lack of proper size validation between the allocated buffer and the amount of data read from the file.
    *   The size of the read operation and the contents of the data being read are controlled by the attacker through the crafted file.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. By overflowing the heap with controlled data, an attacker can overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the program's execution flow.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attack vector is a specially crafted malformed USD file.
    *   The victim needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed USD file.
    *   The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the crafted file using vulnerable software.
