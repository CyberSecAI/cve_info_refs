Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded default credentials for the "Admin" and "Guest" users within CA Introscope Enterprise Manager. These default passwords are not enforced to be changed during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the presence of default, easily guessable credentials that are not required to be changed upon installation. This allows unauthorized access if not properly addressed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass authentication if the default passwords are not changed, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exploitation can impact the confidentiality of the service, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   **Complete Control:** When combined with an OS Command injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-6204, addressed in SAP note 2969828) the attacker can gain full control of the host running the CA Introscope Enterprise Manager.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, requiring no local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Network:** An attacker can exploit this over the network if the vulnerable service is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable CA Introscope Enterprise Manager instance.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need any valid credentials if the defaults are not changed.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Wily Introscope Enterprise, including 9.7, 10.1, 10.5, and 10.7.
*   SAP Security Note 2971638 addresses this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 score assigned to this vulnerability is 7.5, categorized as High risk.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Onapsis Research Labs.
*   This vulnerability is related to SAP Solution Manager and Focused Run systems as CA Introscope Enterprise Manager is bundled with SAP Solution Manager (SolMan).
