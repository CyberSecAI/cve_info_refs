- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control due to lack of authentication protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication mechanism, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based brute-force attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access is required. No user interaction is needed. The attacker doesn't require any privileges.
