Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6387:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the WebRTC component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability lies in how WebRTC handles crafted video streams, leading to a write operation outside of the intended memory boundary.
*   **Heap corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can potentially corrupt the heap memory, leading to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Heap corruption:** A successful exploit can lead to heap corruption.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The heap corruption can potentially be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
*   **Bypass of Site Isolation:** According to Red Hat, an out of bounds write in WebRTC could allow an attacker to bypass site isolation.
*   **Other possible impacts:** Other potential impacts include escalation of privileges, obtaining sensitive information, or causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a network attack.
*   **Crafted video stream:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted video stream to a vulnerable Chrome instance through a malicious website or other means.
*   **Crafted HTML page:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTML page with embedded WebRTC code that triggers the vulnerability when loaded in a vulnerable Chrome browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or a local presence on the victim's machine.
*   **Ability to deliver a crafted video stream or HTML page:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted video stream or HTML page to the victim. This can be done through a website, a malicious advertisement, or other means.
*   **User interaction (required):** The user has to interact with the crafted HTML page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome prior to version 80.0.3987.87.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a high severity rating and a CVSS v3 score of 8.8.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in Chromium and Google Chrome version 80.0.3987.87 and later.
*   Several vendors, including SUSE, Red Hat and Fedora have released security updates to patch this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is described as "important" severity by SUSE and Red Hat.
