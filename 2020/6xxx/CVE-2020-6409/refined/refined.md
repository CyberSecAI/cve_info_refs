Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by an "inappropriate implementation" in the Omnibox component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The core weakness is an implementation flaw within the Omnibox that allows attackers to bypass navigation restrictions.
- This issue is related to how the browser handles and processes URI input, particularly when a user is convinced to enter a specially crafted domain name.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A successful exploit allows an attacker to trick users into visiting a malicious domain by using a crafted domain name that appears legitimate. This could lead to various attacks including phishing, drive-by downloads, or other malicious actions.
- The primary impact is the ability to bypass navigation restrictions, potentially leading to social engineering attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker needs to convince the user to enter a crafted domain name in the browser's address bar (Omnibox).
- User interaction is required, making this vulnerability less severe compared to vulnerabilities that can be exploited without user action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must convince the user to enter a specially crafted domain name. This could be done through social engineering techniques such as phishing emails or deceptive websites.
- No specific attacker position or privilege is required other than the ability to deliver the crafted domain name to a target user.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome versions prior to 80.0.3987.87.
- Multiple sources indicate this vulnerability was resolved in Chromium version 80.0.3987.87.
- The issue is described as an "inappropriate implementation", implying that it may stem from faulty logic or insufficient validation of user input.
