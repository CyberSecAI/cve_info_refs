Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-6078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `mdns_recv` function of the `libmicrodns` library. Specifically, the return value of `mdns_read_header` is not checked. If `mdns_read_header` fails (e.g., due to a malformed or too small mDNS message) it returns `NULL`, but the `mdns_recv` function proceeds to use the header structure without properly initializing it. This can lead to usage of uninitialized data from a previous valid mDNS message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unchecked Return Value (CWE-252):** The primary weakness is the lack of a check on the return value of `mdns_read_header`.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Data:** The failure to check the return value allows the program to proceed with an uninitialized `mdns_hdr` structure.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** When `rr_read` is subsequently called, it dereferences a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation results in a service crash due to a null pointer dereference. An attacker can repeatedly send malicious packets to cause service unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted mDNS messages over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service that uses the libmicrodns library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libmicrodns` version 0.1.0.
*   The fix involves checking the return value of `mdns_read_header` and handling the error properly.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4671-1) mentions that the fix for this and other related vulnerabilities was to disable the microdns plugin in VLC.
