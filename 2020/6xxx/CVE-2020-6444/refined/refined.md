Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-6444, CVE-2020-6443, CVE-2020-6441, CVE-2020-6442, CVE-2020-6445 and CVE-2020-6446:

**CVE-2020-6444**

*   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized use in the WebRTC component of Google Chrome.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability stems from the use of an uninitialized variable, leading to potential heap corruption.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker could potentially exploit heap corruption, leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted HTML page in their browser.

**CVE-2020-6443**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient data validation in the developer tools component of Google Chrome.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper data validation within developer tools.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker who has convinced the user to use devtools can execute arbitrary code, potentially taking full control of the user's system.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by convincing the user to use devtools on a specially crafted HTML page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the devtools on a crafted HTML page.

**CVE-2020-6441**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in the omnibox of Google Chrome.
*  **Weakness:** Inadequate security policies in omnibox.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker could bypass security UI elements.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted HTML page.

**CVE-2020-6442**
*   **Root Cause:** Inappropriate implementation in the cache mechanism of Google Chrome.
*   **Weakness:** An issue in how the browser handles cached data.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can leak cross-origin data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation through a crafted HTML page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a crafted HTML page.

**CVE-2020-6445 and CVE-2020-6446**
*  **Root Cause:** Insufficient policy enforcement in trusted types within Google Chrome.
*  **Weakness:**  Inadequate enforcement of security policies related to trusted types.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can bypass content security policy (CSP).
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted HTML page can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted HTML page.

Additional Notes:

*   All the listed vulnerabilities affect Google Chrome versions prior to 81.0.4044.92.
*   The vulnerabilities are exploitable via a crafted HTML page, indicating that the user would need to interact with malicious content.
*   Several of these vulnerabilities are related to policy enforcement, which suggests issues with how Chrome manages and enforces its security policies, particularly in the context of extensions, navigations, and trusted types.
*   Other vulnerabilities relate to memory management issues (use-after-free, uninitialized use), which are commonly associated with programming flaws.
*   The provided content confirms that the issues have been resolved with updated package versions for multiple Linux distributions (SUSE and Fedora).
