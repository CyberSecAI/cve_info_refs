- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `decode_cnt` function when parsing the length of variable-length integers within SNMP packets. The function uses a size check that can be bypassed due to integer wraparound, leading to an out-of-bounds memory read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds read: The `decode_cnt` function reads beyond the allocated buffer due to an integer overflow, allowing the attacker to access arbitrary memory locations.
    - Integer Overflow: The vulnerability arises from an integer overflow in the size check of the `decode_cnt` function, specifically due to using `size_t` types for comparisons which wrap around.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read allows the attacker to potentially read sensitive information from the server's memory.
    - Denial of Service: Accessing memory out of bounds may lead to a crash and immediate denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: Sending a specially crafted SNMP packet with oversized lengths to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required.
