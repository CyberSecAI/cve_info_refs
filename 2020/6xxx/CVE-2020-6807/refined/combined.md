I dig a bit deeper today. The `0x616000010bdb` here is `destroy_pending: AtomicBool` in `AudioUnitStream` at mod.rs:3270

<https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs/blob/7fe03b4201160f84aad1c12536affe6b05f8839f/src/backend/mod.rs#L3270>

I suspect there is a *stream-reinit-task* posted to the global task queue in the cubeb context (*aka* `AudioUnitContext::serial_queue`) while *stream-destroy-task* is being executed in the global task queue, or `cubeb_stream_destroy` and `audiounit_property_listener_callback` get called at the same time and *stream-reinit-task* is posted after *stream-destroy-task* is posted.

Suppose there are 3 different threads

* *M*: the Main thread running the `test_switch_device` test
* *T*: the thread running the task in the global task queue (`AudioUnitContext::serial_queue`)
* *D*: the *device-changed* callback thread (where`audiounit_property_listener_callback` is on)

The timeline should be like this

1. *M*: Start running `test_switch_device`
2. *M*: Initialize *cubeb context*
3. *M*: Initialize *cubeb stream*
4. *M*: Start *cubeb stream*
5. *M*: Change the default output device
6. The default device is changed: The following works might be run at the same time
   * *M*: Get notification of the device changed
     + Do *5* again until it's repeated *X* times
   * *D*: If the *stream-reinit-task* is pending/being run, skip this event. Otherwise, post an *async* *stream-reinit-task* to the global task queue
     + *T*: Start executing the *stream-reinit-task*
7. The following works might be run at the same time:
   * After the default output device is changed *X* times, the test is about to be finished, so

     *M* start destroying *cubeb stream*, which posts a *sync* *stream-destroy-task* to the the global task queue. Then *M* is blocked until the *stream-destroy-task* is done.
   * While *M* is executing, the *D* is fired for the last device-changed event and then posts an *async* *stream-reinit-task*
8. If *stream-destroy-task* is posted before *stream-reinit-task*, *T* will execute *stream-destroy-task* first
9. *T*: Finishing the *stream-destroy-task*
10. The following works might be run at the same time:
    * *M*: Destroy *cubeb context*
    * *T*: Pick and run the *stream-reinit-task* after the *cubeb stream* is destroyed
      + *T*: Touching `destroy_pending` leads to a crash

At step *10*, touching the `destroy_pending` in a destroyed *cubeb stream* causes the crash.

Got some suggestions from Alex:

---

In addition to what you have, you could use the `if stm_guard.destroy_pending.load(Ordering::SeqCst)` inside the main body of `reinit_async()` in a way that we don't `async_dispatch` another reinit closure if this flag is true. In this case, you would also need synchronization between `destroy()` and `reinit_async()`.

If the solution is the above I guess the c-api is not protected by this problem, probably we haven't tried the same test.

I can make this happen manually with this patch in [version 7fe03b4](https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs/tree/7fe03b4201160f84aad1c12536affe6b05f8839f), by running `cargo test test_stream_tester -- --ignored --nocapture`, with switching device manually and dropping the cubeb context, stream by the test command, at the proper times.

This patch adds delays to force the context-switch at a proper time to demonstrate what happens and use `dbg!` to touch the memory that is free after cubeb context and stream is destroyed.

The device can be switched by clicking the sound device icon on the main UI bar then select one device on the system. To drop the cubeb context and stream, it needs to manually enter the correct command in the `test_stream_tester` test.

The whole log for the demo (`cargo test test_stream_tester -- --ignored --nocapture`) is:

```

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1614971&attachment=9127395)

This is reproducible in [C backend](https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/blob/8fd6845c9e0473073d52f1d3a79b8af55f44c64c/src/cubeb_audiounit.cpp) as well. By applying this patch that adds some delays at the proper time, the UAF can be reproduced via `cubeb-test`. The delays are added in the same place exactly as those in the [Attachment 9126802](/attachment.cgi?id=9126802 "UAF-demo.diff") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9126802&action=edit "UAF-demo.diff") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=9126802&action=diff "UAF-demo.diff").

(In reply to C.M.Chang[:chunmin] from [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio"))

> I guess the c-api is not protected by this problem, probably we haven't tried the same test.

Yes, this is reproducible in both C and Rust backend. The steps-to-reproduce are in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio") and [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio").

> In addition to what you have, you could use the `if stm_guard.destroy_pending.load(Ordering::SeqCst)` inside the main body of `reinit_async()` in a way that we don't `async_dispatch` another reinit closure if this flag is true. In this case, you would also need synchronization between `destroy()` and `reinit_async()`.

Actually, I've tried this at first. But it doesn't seem to work (Not sure if I understand the suggestion correctly though). Since the reinit-task and destroy-task are racing, `destroy_pending` might be `false` even if `destroy` is called.

Another way I could think is to move the ownership of the task queue to the cubeb stream, instead of the cubeb context. The task will be created in the stream, instead of the cubeb context. Then when the stream is being destroyed, we can cancel all the pending tasks. However, there is [Dispatch Queue](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html) API that can do that. We may need to create a task-queue class by our own (and it needs to make sure it won't regress the data race fixed in [bug 1598413](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598413 "RESOLVED FIXED - Avoid racing issue when play/stop and reinit or destroy stream at the same time")).

Move the test log to the first line of the switch-device test. It will

be clearer about what's going on when the error log is printed.

[Bug 1614971 - Fix the UAF. r?padenot](attachment.cgi?id=9127642)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9127642&action=edit)

The UAF is actually caused by a data race between the stream-reinit task

on the device-changed callback thread, and the stream-destroy task on

the main audio thread. When the device is changed upon the stream is

about to be destroyed, the stream-reinit task can be posted to the

global task queue just right after the stream-destroy task in that task

queue. As a result, the stream-reinit task will be executed after the

stream is destroyed and cause a used-after-free error.

The solution here is to unregister the device-changed callback before

the stream is destroyed, on the main audio thread. The calls for

unregistering device-changed callbacks will block the current thread

until all the pending device-changed callbacks finish, and stop firing

any callbacks in the future. This makes sure the following things

* No device-changed callback thread will run while the stream is ready

  to be destroyed.
* No stream-reinit task can be appended to the task queue

As a result,

* There is no device-changed callback thread that races with the task

  thread running the stream-destroy task
* There is no stream-reinit task appended after the stream-destroy task.

(Note that the running data callbacks will be stopped in the

stream-destroy task, by stopping the running AudioUnits, before

destroying the stream.)

[Bug 1614971](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio") - Fix the UAF. r?padenot

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: It's not hard to infer when the data race causing an UAF can happen by reading this patch carefully.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: For new Rust backend, it's FF74. For C backend, it exists for a long time.
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: For Rust cubeb backend, this patch can be uplifted to the FF74 easily.

  For C cubeb backend, it's easy to import this change from the Rust backend to C backend.

However, the cubeb code are in public github repos.

* main cubeb repo: <https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb>
* Rust cubeb on Mac OSx: <https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs>

The update will be submitted in github repos instead of being updated in the gecko directly. I am not sure how to hide the security vulnerability properly when updating the code. (One thing I can do is to update the code without commit messages or comments. The comments can be added in other separated commits anyway.)

* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It's a small change without doing anything that can change the behavior. The change here is to destroy the audio stream properly to prevent system callback from being executed after the stream is destroyed.

The code will be imported in [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725), instead of [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369). [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369) is created to hide the review in the public git repo, since the code is in a third-party library developed by *Mozilla*.

The commit message is simplied to *Destroy the stream properly* without any explanation. The title of [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725), *Update cubeb-coreaudio to 4acd802*, is a regular update title, as what we used to have in the past.

Can I carry the sec-approval from [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369) to [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725)? Or I need to ask a sec-approval again?

Sure.

> I don't see a backport for esr68 but you said you had one, so please ensure esr68 gets it.

The fix is under review in another github repo: <https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/pull/574>. It will be imported to gecko once it's merge in the repo's master branch. It should be similar to what we have in [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725). I'll ask a sec-approval again then.

Paul, can you help me to merge <https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/pull/574> ? I don't have right to do so if the fix should be uplifted to esr 68.

I've merged it now. Paul had already reviewed it, so it was just waiting on the merge.

It looks like I sent you an invite for cubeb repo access a while ago, but it must've gone missing. I'll PM you a new invite link.

I am not sure if this bug blocks [bug 863846](/show_bug.cgi?id=863846 "NEW - [meta] Maintain Firefox ASan build process and compatibility").

This errors are found by running Asan in the test of a [third-party audio library](https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs) used and maintained by Mozilla. The error happens when users unplug or switch the current output audio device. I don't think those tests are run in Firefox's test, and this won't be detected in the build process. Is there a better category, instead of *asan build*, to track this bug ?

```

The ECMAScript specification requires the promise resolution algorithm to synchronously access the

`then` property of the resolution object. Therefore, when a user defines a corresponding accessor on

`Object.prototype`, a majority of calls to `ResolvePromise` become observable to user JavaScript

code.

`ReadableStreamCloseInternal` fails to take that into account. The function doesn't check whether

the length of the request container[2] remains unchanged after a call to `ResolvePromise`[5] and

uses the original length as the loop exit condition[3]. If an attacker shrinks the container from

inside the promise resolution, `getAs`[4] will access out-of-bounds data during the next iteration.

The code sets the stream's state to `closed`[1] before iterating through the requests, and most

methods that modify the container check that the stream is in the `readable` state first. However,

the `tee` algorithm employs its own set of flags to track the state of the child streams[7]. These

flags only get updated after the loop has ended[6], so `TeeReaderReadHandler` will pass all the

checks even when it's called from inside `ResolvePromise`.

The only remaining obstacle is that `TeeReaderReadHandler` is attached to a promise reaction and is

supposed to always run asynchronously. Therefore, the attacker has to figure out how to

synchronously trigger promise reactions. Roughly speaking, reactions get executed when the last

active `nsAutoMicroTask` object is destroyed. The main challenge here is to run JavaScript outside

the `nsAutoMicroTask` scope. Conventional means of running JS like event handlers, `setTimeout` and

<script> elements won't work as they always instantiate a new `nsAutoMicroTask`. Instead, the

attacker can reuse the `then` accessor technique and execute JavaScript, for example, during

resolution of a promise created by the Fetch API. The stack trace in this case looks as follows:

```
CallGetter
GetExistingProperty
NativeGetPropertyInline
js::NativeGetProperty
js::GetProperty
js::GetProperty
js::GetProperty
ResolvePromiseInternal
js::PromiseObject::resolve
ResolveOrRejectPromise
js::ReadableStreamFulfillReadOrReadIntoRequest
JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource
mozilla::dom::BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady
nsInputStreamReadyEvent::Run

```

All that's left then is to create and immediately destroy an `nsAutoMicroTask` object at the right

time, which is trivial.

I can approximately comprehend many of the words in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security: OOB access in js::ReadableStreamCloseInternal"), but my understanding of microtasks and exactly how they are specified to work is...not good enough to understand the details roughly once `nsAutoMicroTask` gets mentioned. I may need to drag in a DOM expert or so to make progress through this, and to figure out what the *right* way to address it is, exactly.

CCing suspects for investigation, since I barely understand the JS half of this and I emphatically do not understand the DOM or `nsAutoMicroTask` portion of this; will try to poke people to see if we can walk through this in-person in Berlin today, too.

So I managed to find Olli at lunch...then as I was eating nearby he disappeared and I lost track of him. Let's go to needinfo, at least til I can find him in person. I have an hour and a half til the next place I have to be, if something possibly can be fit in in that time...

I briefly described/discussed this with annevk as well a few minutes ago, and he was wondering if we were just flat-out missing an `nsAutoMicroTask` somewhere -- because it ought not be possible for the `ResolvePromise` to induce a synchronous resolution that way. This seems at least *possible* to me, based on my meager knowledge of promises and the DOM side of them, but I definitely don't have the knowledge to evaluate the claim and have any confidence in my evaluation.

So looking at this over IRL, we think there's definitely a missing `nsAutoMicroTask` in `mozilla::dom::BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady` or so -- a microtask missed because it wasn't recognized that the JSAPI function called there could cause script to run. :-|

Once that's set aside, tho, it seems like it ought be fragile to loop over indexes in the read requests array this way. But, it really shouldn't be -- that array shouldn't be being touched by any code other than this, when the stream is already marked as closed. It feels to me like we should 1) change the relevant steps of `ReadableStreamCloseInternal` so that we *extract* the requests array (implicitly clearing the stored array) before we process it (now as sole owner of it), which requires 2) figuring out who else is "simultaneously" accessing-and-mutating that array and making them stop. It *looks* like the simultaneous access is supposed to only be possible with a spec bug -- maybe? -- but I'm building a browser now to see if I'm misreading things (very possible). Once we do that, tho, there would not be a possibility of multiple places in code modifying this array at the same time, and it would then be safe and normal to loop element-by-element as we do now.

IRL I wondered if just replacing then() with something which modifies the stream internals is enough to trigger this.

Running the testcase in a debug build will fail the assertion at the end of this snippet:

```
MOZ_MUST_USE bool js::ReadableStreamDefaultControllerEnqueue(
    JSContext* cx, Handle<ReadableStreamDefaultController*> unwrappedController,
    Handle<Value> chunk) {
  AssertSameCompartment(cx, chunk);

  // Step 1: Let stream be controller.[[controlledReadableStream]].
  Rooted<ReadableStream*> unwrappedStream(cx, unwrappedController->stream());

  // Step 2: Assert:
  //      ! ReadableStreamDefaultControllerCanCloseOrEnqueue(controller) is
  //      true.
  MOZ_ASSERT(!unwrappedController->closeRequested());
  MOZ_ASSERT(unwrappedStream->readable());

```

The ReadableStream tee code can call this function, on a controller for a stream that does not satisfy step 2 -- which associated spec prose indicates is a *precondition*. So possibly the ReadableStream tee code should be checking not just `!canceled1`, but also can-close-or-enqueue, before doing its thing. (This appears to be the only place that can touch this array -- so if we fix this, we can extract out the array and operate on it as a local, as suggested in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security: OOB access in js::ReadableStreamCloseInternal").)

OK, so a few things:

1. Given that ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource can run script, `BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady` should absolutely have an `AutoEntryScript`, not an `AutoJSAPI`.
2. `AutoEntryScript` is spec-visible, in the sense that it can trigger promise reactions when it comes off the stack. Specs should generally have corresponding bits involving manipulating the script context stack and doing microtask checkpoints (e.g. see "prepare to run a script" or "prepare to run a callback" in the HTML spec, and their corresponding cleanup algorithms). Sounds like the streams spec needs to do something like that, if it's introducing script entry points....

So, missing `AutoEntryScript` is apparently really terrible. Could we at least make it not security-terrible, by making `JS::ResolvePromise` or whatever the underlying-est primitive is, check that we're always inside some sort of whatever-it-is-`AutoEntryScript` enacts (and probably crash if we aren't)? Doesn't solve the missing-an-entry problem and identifying all such places, but at least it means missing something isn't bad.

So I may be doing something terribly wrong somehow, but if I write that patch *without* the explicit `nsAutoMicroTask mt;`, `AutoEntryScript` does not actually seem to defer microtask resolution, and the assertion/crash are still possible. For comparison, script execution has in sequence an `nsAutoMicroTask mt;` followed by an `AutoEntryScript`:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/script/ScriptLoader.cpp#2710>

If I really shouldn't need the `nsAutoMicroTask mt;` there, it seems like something else would need changing for that. Right?

(I'm approximately science-dogging away here, so if it looks like I have no idea what I'm doing there's a good reason for that...)

Another possibility, besides (in addition to?) crashing in resolve/reject-promise internals if there's no microtask queue pending, would be to check/assert/crash in `nsAutoMicroTask` if there are any pending promise jobs to reject/resolve when the constructor call happens (and the constructor call isn't a nested `nsAutoMicroTask`).

Apparently.... I wonder whether we could do an nsAutoMicrotask in AutoJSAPI without causing visible spec violations.

The underlying-est primitives are whatever can run script.

We have basically two options, not necessarily mutually exclusive. One is to do check-and-crash at the actual script entry points. So for example in `js::InternalCallOrConstruct` or some such, if we push things down as much as we can to make sure we're definitely catching all the cases that would definitely enter script. This has the benefit of good coverage of the really-dangerous cases and the drawback of bad coverage of callsites that only *sometimes* call script (e.g. the "then" getter involved in this case!). The second option is to put these checks at higher-level entrypoints. `ResolvePromise` is a bit too high-level; it makes more sense to put it in `GetProperty` somewhere, since `ResolvePromise` *always* calls `GetProperty`, right?

As far as what the check should be checking... there isn't anything specific right now to check, unfortunately. We could add something, but doing it *fast* would be an issue, unless we stored it on the JSContext itself or something like that.

Bobby may have some thoughts too; I thought he'd planned on this sort of enforcement initially with AutoEntryScript.

> AutoEntryScript does not actually seem to defer microtask resolution

Ugh. I was sure that `AutoEntryScript` had an `AutoMicroTask` inside, but apparently not? Looks like `CallSetup` does separate microtask management as well.

I think that's pretty unexpected and we should *definitely* have an AutoMicroTask as part of AutoEntryScript, though some consumers that want to defer the microtask checkpoint until later than ~AutoEntryScript might need a separate AutoMicroTask anyway.

We'd need to audit consumers, sadly, to make sure we don't coalesce microtasks across too much stuff. For example, `CustomElementReactionsStack::InvokeReactions` will sometimes have an AES live across all the reactions (!), which would probably give the wrong microtask semantics...

The good news is we only have about 50 uses of AutoEntryScript. The bad news is that I expect most are broken wrt microtasks; we should be able to write tests for this...

So [bug 1181740](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181740 "NEW - Replace nsAutoMicroTask with a class that does both a microtask and an entry script that takes ownership of error reporting") was sort of about removing the cases when we have "nsAutoMicroTask but not AES". The discussion above is removing cases when we have "AES but not nsAutoMicroTask"...

I'm sure I don't understand the constraints enough, but at least within this bug's tunnel-vision I am worrying solely about promise resolution happening unexpectedly early. And so `ResolvePromise` (or maybe `ResolvePromiseInternal`) is the underlying-est primitive to target that particular gang-aft-agley scenario. And promise resolving/rejecting is a drawn-out slow process that could tolerate one more check.

If things go awry for other stuff like `GetProperty` or any function call at all, those are probably not code paths that could support a check of this every time they happen...I would think. We'd need better can-run-script attributing or something else for that.

Ah. I was worried about script running without an AES on the stack, which is also a bad thing that we need to prevent.

(In reply to Boris Zbarsky [:bzbarsky, bz on IRC] from [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security: OOB access in js::ReadableStreamCloseInternal"))

> Bobby may have some thoughts too; I thought he'd planned on this sort of enforcement initially with AutoEntryScript.

We have [bug 1108262](/show_bug.cgi?id=1108262 "REOPENED - Audit use of AutoJSAPI and replace it when needed with AutoEntryScript") on file for that, at least. I think we discussed this a few times over the years, but never acted on it. Would certainly be worth making this whole situation less foot-gun-y.

> Ugh. I was sure that `AutoEntryScript` had an `AutoMicroTask` inside, but apparently not?

I originally wanted to do this, but IIRC you and/or smaug insisted that the spec required otherwise. I have a few IRC logs from that era I could dig up if that's helpful.

> but IIRC you and/or smaug insisted that the spec required otherwise

I don't think it would have been me, because I am pretty sure I did not pretend to understand microtasks back then.

The really big question is whether all the places where we have AutoEntryScript correspond to the spec pushing things on the JavaScript context stack... Really whether they correspond to <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#prepare-to-run-script> and <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#clean-up-after-running-script> -- the former basically does a thing that means "no microtasks will run" and the latter will run microtasks if it's the outermost script execution.

[Maybe another bug I found?](attachment.cgi?id=9125293)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9125293&action=edit)

So in the course of writing minimal testcases (before wrangling them into wpt shape), I happened to write this testcase. Obviously it fails without this patch...but it fails this assertion

```
    // The WriteInto callback changes mState to eChecking.
    MOZ_ASSERT_IF(ok, mState == eChecking);

```

immediately after `JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource` finishes.

Moreover, it fails that assertion even with this patch in place.

This *probably* is just because `alert` means nested event queues or other insanity along those lines, but I don't know. The assert here is in `BodyStream.cpp`, so it could be a problem with `BodyStream.cpp`. Maybe this assertion assumes the invisibility/un-alterability of the update-data-available action, that is belied by this stupid `"then"` interposition mandated by promises?

Is there an additional problem here, worth a separate bug, that is not just "`alert` is known to be terrible"? And if there is one, how ought I go about filing a bug on it in a way that doesn't inadvertently reveal the existence of this bug?

Will do.

Given this is security and all, I'm a bit paranoid about just adding explanatory comments, so I moved the removal of the assertion into my patch, commandeered your revision (hopefully without changing author, or at least the revision I submitted with `moz-phab` had you set as author) and made it add the comment, then submitted those with the test on top of them.

I'm still floundering my way through the spec idioms some, so I'm going to go for approvals and not hold that up for whatever spec changes may be needed here.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Someone who understands the precise ramifications of a missing microtask queue setup probably can attack the absence of this patch pretty easily.

If they're doing the trick that was done here -- abuse streams code that presumes promises are never fulfilled synchronously -- the failure mode is accessing off the end of (what can be made to be) a heap allocation, then interpreting that data as a `JSObject*`, then using it as if it were valid. It's probably not *entirely* easy, but if you have that much rope I expect a capable attacker *probably* can get to arbitrary code execution.

If they're doing some other trick, that abuses the absence of an `AutoEntryScript`, I do not understand the ramifications of this enough to say what the bad things that can happen are. Except that apparently they are Bad.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: Goes back to at least esr68, so of them
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: The patch applies cleanly to beta.

ESR68 has this code in `dom/fetch/FetchStream.cpp`, but it's pretty easy to make the necessary changes. I've made them locally, will post that patch in a sec.

* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It's a pretty straightforward patch, unlikely to cause regressions. Definitely on the safer side, but probably not *entirely absolutely* safe.

It would have caused us trigger microtask checkpoint when entering chrome JS.

* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Pretty straightforward to add script entrypoint/microtask handling here, changes are pretty understandable. The changes have a variety of interesting *implications* that are not drop-dead simple, so if I had the option I'd probably rate it somewhere between low and medium. But I don't, and the change couldn't be any smaller, and `AutoEntryScript` and `nsAutoMicroTask` are both widely used so are generously exercised, so it seems to shade a bit closer to low than to medium.
* **String changes made/needed**:

Only when there's no content JS on the stack already, right? I guess that could still be an issue if there are places which effectively post a microtask while not in the scope of an nsAutoMicrotask, whether in our impl or in the spec?

Evidently just AES/nsAutoMicroTask-ing is mutex-unhappymaking. How to fix, how to fix...

Well that was dumb, can't use `MutexAutoUnlock` which is RAII to affect a previously-declared thing that is *also* RAII. Time for some wonderfully terrible `Maybe<MutexAutoLock>`. 😬 Try churns away...again.

I probably should have clarified -- not just as a comment on the trunk-targeted phabricator rev -- that the esr68 patch has not been updated with the amendments to the trunk patch. (This system where we have two separate places to record progress, here and phabricator, is such garbage. :-( )

Beefed up the comment-adding patch with comments relating to why `Maybe<MutexAutoLock>` is desirable/necessary. Still need to get to making any spec changes to do microtask handling/etc. properly.

Well this is interesting. It appears this problem affected more browser engines than just us:

<https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1029>

That looks like the hackaround workaround I initially thought was needed here, but really the problem was with our DOM code not deferring the processing. I'll keep poking there and see if we can't get the root cause fixed in whatever the relevant spec is.

If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60

and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these

passwords would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, obtain sensitive information,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-20503](/security/CVE-2019-20503), [CVE-2020-6798](/security/CVE-2020-6798), [CVE-2020-6800](/security/CVE-2020-6800),

[CVE-2020-6805](/security/CVE-2020-6805), [CVE-2020-6806](/security/CVE-2020-6806), [CVE-2020-6807](/security/CVE-2020-6807), [CVE-2020-6812](/security/CVE-2020-6812), [CVE-2020-6814](/security/CVE-2020-6814),

[CVE-2020-6819](/security/CVE-2020-6819), [CVE-2020-6820](/security/CVE-2020-6820), [CVE-2020-6821](/security/CVE-2020-6821), [CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

Announced
March 10, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 74

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

##### References

* [Bug 1247968](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247968)

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

##### References

* [Bug 1420296](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296)

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

##### References

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

##### References

* [Bug 1613765](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613765)

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

##### References

* [Bug 1616661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661)

#### [#CVE-2020-6813: @import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature](#CVE-2020-6813)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
low
##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

##### References

* [Bug 1605814](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1605814)

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2020-6815: Memory and script safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74](#CVE-2020-6815)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Boris Zbarsky, Tyson Smith, and Alexandru Michis reported memory safety and script safety bugs present in Firefox 73. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation of privilege and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
