# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-13

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 68.7

Announced
April 7, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.7

#### [#CVE-2020-6828: Preference overwrite via crafted Intent from malicious Android application](#CVE-2020-6828)

Reporter
fatal0
Impact
high
##### Description

A malicious Android application could craft an Intent that would have been processed by Firefox for Android and potentially result in a file overwrite in the user's profile directory. One exploitation vector for this would be to supply a user.js file providing arbitrary malicious preference values. Control of arbitrary preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such that it is generally equivalent to arbitrary code execution.
 *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1617928](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1617928)

#### [#CVE-2020-6827: Custom Tabs in Firefox for Android could have the URI spoofed](#CVE-2020-6827)

Reporter
Juho Nurminen of Mattermost
Impact
high
##### Description

When following a link that opened an intent://-schemed URL, causing a custom tab to be opened, Firefox for Android could be tricked into displaying the incorrect URI.
 *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1622278](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1622278)

#### [#CVE-2020-6821: Uninitialized memory could be read when using the WebGL copyTexSubImage method](#CVE-2020-6821)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
Impact
high
##### Description

When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's `copyTexSubImage` method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

##### References

* [Bug 1625404](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625404)

#### [#CVE-2020-6822: Out of bounds write in GMPDecodeData when processing large images](#CVE-2020-6822)

Reporter
Deian Stefan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image larger than 4 GB in `GMPDecodeData`. It is possible that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1544181](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1544181)

#### [#CVE-2020-6825: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7](#CVE-2020-6825)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9128841&action=edit)

It has been found the firefox android application accepts Intents from third-parties. When a crafted Intent containing a URI pointing to a custom-defined ContentProvider is sent, the application queries the ContentProvider to fetch files. This allows overwriting files under the private application folder.

By exploiting this vulnerability, it is possible to overwrite /data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/profiles.ini and put a user.js file into the user's directory which can lead to network hijacking.

Vulnerability in this method:

org.mozilla.gecko.util.ContentUriUtils.getTempFilePathFromContentUri

Firefox Version: 68.5.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. see the screen record

Stefan, Snorp, can you please take a look at this? I can't really say how viable an attack through crafted intents is, but overwriting arbitrary prefs/files in the app directory is almost as bad as it can get.

Thanks!

Ugh. Yup, this is pretty bad.

It looks like in order to fix, we should just use the leaf file name here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/b2ccce862ef38d0d150fcac2b597f7f20091a0c7/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/gecko/util/FileUtils.java#321>

If we don't do this, the filename can look like "../../files/mozilla/profiles.ini", which causes us to overwrite our own profiles.ini, etc. We should treat it as "profiles.ini" instead.

This affects Fennec and Fenix, doesn't it?

We ought to patch both.

Sebastian tells me this only affects Fennec.

From what I understand, we want to roll out fenix gradually to existing beta users, which means we can't easily ship a security update without delaying that. But updating to would fix this problem for beta population over the course of the next ~2 weeks.

This would still leave fennec release users affected until we start the roll out in early April (~5 weeks from now).

Maybe we could do the fenix roll-out for beta and fix fennec-release directly after beta has gone to 100% (i.e., after those two weeks)?

I'd still very much like to hear what st3fan and Dan think.

[Bug 1617928 - Sanitize "content" uri filenames; r?AndreiLazar,snorp](attachment.cgi?id=9130800) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9130800&action=edit)

For loading a file exposed through a provider Fennec will first copy the file

in it's cache folder (internal storage).

Tricking Fennec into thinking the file name should contain forward slashes will

result in saving the file to a different than intended location potentially

overwriting important application data.

To mitigate this attack vector we'll always check for forward slashes in the

filename and if so always keep just the leaf.

That would be great. I could see us trying to use it in the future to handle `content://`.

The vuln combination, maybe, because we block it at the intents end. We should fix FileUtils for both just in case there's another or future way to get there in other GeckoView products (what snorp said in [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1617928#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox for Android - Directory Traversal can lead to network hijacking")).

Does shipping Focus respond to or ignore those intents?

* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All branches. Bug was probably introduced in [bug 1499618](/show_bug.cgi?id=1499618 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: at android.database.AbstractCursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(AbstractCursor.java)")

* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: The solution is simple.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Very low chances of regressions. Testing based on the provided poc should be enough.

Per discussion this is going to land under a public bug, with the comments changes so it looks less like a security fix.
