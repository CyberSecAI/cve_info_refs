Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6828:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within Firefox for Android when handling `content://` URIs. Specifically, the `org.mozilla.gecko.util.ContentUriUtils.getTempFilePathFromContentUri` method did not properly sanitize filenames extracted from these URIs. This allowed a malicious application to craft a `content://` URI with a file name containing directory traversal characters (e.g., `../../`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The core vulnerability is the ability to use directory traversal sequences in filenames, allowing access to and overwriting files in arbitrary locations within the application's private storage.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `getTempFilePathFromContentUri` method failed to sanitize the filename from the `content://` URI, allowing the malicious path to be used during file operations.
*   **Preference Overwrite:**  Specifically, the ability to overwrite the `profiles.ini` file, which could be used to load a malicious `user.js`, and thus, allows the attacker to control arbitrary preference values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files within the Firefox for Android application's private data directory.
*   **Preference Hijacking:** By overwriting the `profiles.ini` and introducing a `user.js` file, an attacker can inject malicious preferences leading to network hijacking and other malicious behaviors.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Control of arbitrary preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such that it is generally equivalent to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Android Application:** The attack requires a separate malicious Android application that can send a specially crafted Intent to Firefox for Android.
*   **Crafted Intent:** The malicious application crafts an Intent containing a `content://` URI pointing to a custom-defined ContentProvider. The URI must contain a malicious filename with directory traversal characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create and Install a Malicious Android App:** The attacker needs to develop and distribute (or sideload) a malicious Android application.
*   **Target must have Firefox for Android Installed:** The target device must have Firefox for Android installed.
*   **Ability to Send Intents:** The malicious app must be able to send Intents to the Firefox for Android application.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `org.mozilla.gecko.util.ContentUriUtils.getTempFilePathFromContentUri` method.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the filename by using only the leaf filename and removing directory traversal characters.

This issue only affects Firefox for Android; other operating systems are not affected.
