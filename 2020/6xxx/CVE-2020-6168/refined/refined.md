Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2020-6168:

**Root Cause:**
The plugin uses `is_admin()` to check if a request is coming from an administrator before enabling or disabling maintenance mode. However, `is_admin()` only checks if the request is being sent to an administrative page, which is accessible to any logged-in user, not just administrators. This incorrect permission check allows any authenticated user to toggle maintenance mode, which is not the intended behavior and constitutes an insecure permission vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect use of `is_admin()` for permission checks, allowing non-administrator users to perform administrative actions.
-   **Lack of Nonce Checks:** Although not the primary vulnerability, the lack of nonce checks, as mentioned, makes the issue potentially exploitable via CSRF if an attacker can not get a user account on the affected site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service:** Any authenticated user can enable maintenance mode, effectively taking the site offline for regular visitors.
-   **Disruption of Site Functionality:** Users with subscriber or above permissions can toggle maintenance mode on and off disrupting the site's intended functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Direct Request:** An authenticated user with subscriber or above permissions can send a crafted request to `admin.php` with the appropriate action and parameters to enable or disable maintenance mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account with subscriber permissions or above on the target WordPress site.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to send requests to the target site.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability is present in versions 2.10 and below of the "Minimal Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode â€“ Coming Soon Page" plugin.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.15 and later.
-   The Wordfence blog post provides proof of concept (PoC) requests to exploit this vulnerability, which involve crafting specific URLs with `admin.php` and the necessary query parameters.
