Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6111

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper handling of length parameter inconsistency when processing ICMP packets with an invalid IPv4 total length in Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100 Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The PLC's IPv4 stack does not properly validate the length field in ICMP packets.
*   CWE-130: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency
*   CWE-189: Numeric Errors

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial-of-service (DoS): Sending a specially crafted ICMP packet with an invalid length can cause the PLC to enter a "Hard Fault" (8H) state or crash.
*   The PLC becomes unresponsive and unable to perform its control functions.
*   Recovery requires power cycling the controller and redownloading the project.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attack: The attacker sends the malformed ICMP packet over the network to the target PLC.
*   Remote and unauthenticated: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without prior authentication to the PLC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PLC.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the PLC.
*   Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
*   Affected Product: Rockwell Automation Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1100 Programmable Logic Controller, various firmware revisions are affected including 1.0 and Series B FRN 10.000, 11.000, 12.000, 13.000, 14.000, 15.000, 15.002, and 16.000.
*   CVSS v3 Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
*   Reported by: Cisco Talos team.
*   Mitigation: Upgrade to MicroLogix 1400 and apply firmware v21.006 or later. Network segmentation, firewalls, VPNs, and disabling internet access for control system devices are also recommended.
