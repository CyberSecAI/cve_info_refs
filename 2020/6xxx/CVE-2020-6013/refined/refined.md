Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure directory privileges within ZoneAlarm Extreme Security. Specifically, a directory used by the software had overly permissive access rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Directory Permissions:** The core issue is that a directory used by ZoneAlarm had permissions that allowed local users to modify its contents. This allowed a local attacker to replace legitimate files with malicious ones.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By placing malicious files in this directory, a local attacker could achieve local privilege escalation. The attacker could overwrite files used by the program or by other applications, to cause them to run in an elevated context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation would allow a local attacker to elevate their privileges on the affected system. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with system-level privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have existing access to the system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to replace legitimate files in the vulnerable directory with malicious files to execute their code.
*   **Timing:** A "sophisticated timed attacker" is mentioned in relation to a related CVE which would imply that timing may be relevant for exploitation in cases where other protections are in place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the targeted machine.
*   **File System Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific directory with insecure permissions.
*   **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create and place malicious files or linked content (e.g., symlinks or hard links) within the vulnerable directory.
*   **Microsoft CVE-2020-0896 Unpatched Systems** The content specifies that the vulnerability can only be exploited on systems that have not been patched for CVE-2020-0896, implying that the insecure directory permissions could be leveraged to exploit that vulnerability on unpatched systems.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in ZoneAlarm Extreme Security version 15.8.109.18436.
*   The description highlights the link between this vulnerability and Microsoft CVE-2020-0896, which means systems unpatched for the Microsoft vulnerability are particularly vulnerable to this ZoneAlarm security issue.
