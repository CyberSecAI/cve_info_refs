Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an "inappropriate implementation" within the Blink rendering engine of Google Chrome. Specifically, a flaw in how Blink processes certain HTML elements or code leads to a memory corruption issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Heap Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to a heap corruption, meaning that memory allocated on the heap can be overwritten or corrupted by the flawed code in Blink.
-   **Inappropriate Implementation:** The vulnerability stems from an improper way the Blink engine is implemented.
-   **Memory Safety:** The core issue is a memory safety violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could enable a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to run code on the user's machine with the privileges of the user running the browser.
-   **Potential Heap Exploitation:** Since the vulnerability is in the heap, the exploitation might involve more advanced techniques of heap manipulation.
-   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-Based Attack:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
-   **Crafted HTML Page:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTML page, meaning that a user would have to visit a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need to have local access to the system.
-   **Ability to Serve Malicious HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a specially crafted HTML page.
-   **User Interaction:** The victim must visit a malicious website for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Notes**

-   The vulnerability is described as a "medium" severity by Google, while SUSE rates it as "important."
-   The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome versions prior to 80.0.3987.87.
-   The vulnerability is located in the Blink rendering engine, which is also used by other browsers.
- The vulnerability is fixed in the 80.0.3987.87 version of Chrome and Chromium.
- This vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTML page.

This analysis provides a clear picture of the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors and required attacker capabilities related to CVE-2020-6404.
