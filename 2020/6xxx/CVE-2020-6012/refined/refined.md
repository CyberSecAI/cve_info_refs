Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-6012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware versions before 1.0.713 copied files for report generation from a directory with low privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file handling: The Anti-Ransomware software used a low-privilege directory for storing temporary files needed for report creation. This made the process vulnerable to file replacement attacks.
- Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability: A sophisticated attacker could have exploited the time gap between when the report files were created and when they were used by the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker could potentially replace the temporary files with malicious content.
- On unpatched systems, this could have been used to exploit other vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-0896, potentially leading to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker must be able to write files into the low-privileged temporary directory used by ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system running a vulnerable version of ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware.
- The attacker must have the ability to write to the low-privilege directory used by the application for report generation.
- A sophisticated, timed attack is needed to replace the files before they are used.
