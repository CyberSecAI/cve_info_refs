CarbonFTP v1.4

CarbonFTP is a file synchronization tool that enables you to synch local files with a remote FTP server and vice versa.
It provides a step-by-step wizard to select the folders to be synchronized, the direction of the synchronization and
option
to set file masks to limit the transfer to specific file types. Your settings can be saved as projects, so they can be
quickly re-used later.

[Vulnerability Type]
Insecure Proprietary Password Encryption

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2020-6857

[Affected Component]
Password Encryption

[Impact Escalation of Privileges]
true

[Impact Information Disclosure]
true

[Security Issue]
CarbonFTP v1.4 uses insecure proprietary password encryption with a hard-coded weak encryption key.
The key for locally stored FTP server passwords is hard-coded in the binary. Passwords encoded as hex
are coverted to decimal which is then computed by adding the key "97F" to the result. The key 97F seems
to be the same for all executables across all systems. Finally, passwords are stored as decimal values.

If a user chooses to save the project the passwords are stored in ".CFTP" local configuration files.
They can be found under "C:\Users\<VICTIM>\AppData\Roaming\Neowise\CarbonFTPProjects".

e.g.

Password=STRING|"2086721956209392195620939"

Observing some very short password examples we see interesting patterns:

27264 27360 27360 27360 27360    =   a
27520 27617 27617 27617 27617    =   b
27266 27616 27360 27361 27616    =   aab
27521 27616 27616 27616 27616    =   ba

Password encryption/decryption is as follows.

Encryption process example.
484C as decimal is the value 18508
97F hex to decimal is the value 2431 (encrypt key)
18508 + 2431 = 20939, the value 20939 would then represent the ascii characters "HL".

To decrypt we just perform the reverse of the operation above.
20939 - 2431 = 18508
Next, convert the decimal value 18508 to hex and we get 484C.
Finally, convert the hex value 484C to ascii to retrieve the plaintext password of "HL".

CarbonFTP passwords less than nine characters are padded using chars from the current password up until
reaching a password length of nine bytes.

The two char password "XY" in encrypted form "2496125048250482504825048" is padded with "XY" until reaching a length
of nine bytes "XYXYXYXYX".

Similarly, the password "HELL" is "2086721956209392195620939" and again is padded since its length is less than nine
bytes.

Therefore, we will get several cracked password candidates like: "HELLHELL | HELLHEL | HELLH | HELL | HEL | HE |
HELLHELLH"
However, the longer the password the easier it becomes to crack them, as we can decrypt passwords in one
shot without having several candidates to choose from with one of them being the correct password.

Therefore, "LOOOOONGPASSWORD!" is stored as the encrypted string "219042273422734224782298223744247862350210947"
and because it is greater than nine bytes it is cracked without any candidate passwords returned.

```
> ```
> From offset 0047DA6F to 0047DAA0 is the loop that performs the password decryption process.
>
> ```

```
Using the same password "HELL" as example.

Ok, simple explanation after SetBPX in 47DA88...

At offset 0047DA8D,  97F is subtracted at [ebp-8] local variable which equals the decimal value 2431 (hex 97F)
we also see EAX holds the value 55C4
sub eax,dword ptr ss:[ebp-8]
therefore, 55C4 â 97F = 4C45            <======= ENCRYPT/DECRYPT KEY PROCESS.
mov word ptr ds:[esi],ax
add esi, 2  which is 4C45 + 2 = 4C47    <===== THEN

Given a two letter combination like "HL":
484C as decimal is 18508
97F hex to decimal is 2431
18508 + 2431 = 20939 = "HL"

Done!

[Affected Component]
Password Encryption

[Security Issue]
CarbonFTP v1.4 uses insecure proprietary password encryption with a
hard-coded weak encryption key.
The key for locally stored FTP server passwords is hard-coded in the
binary. Passwords encoded as hex
are coverted to decimal which is then computed by adding the key "97F" to
the result. The key 97F seems
to be the same for all executables across all systems. Finally, passwords
are stored as decimal values.

If a user chooses to save the project the passwords are stored in ".CFTP"
local configuration files.
They can be found under
"C:\Users\<VICTIM>\AppData\Roaming\Neowise\CarbonFTPProjects".

e.g.

Password=STRING|"2086721956209392195620939"

Observing some very short password examples we see interesting patterns:

27264 27360 27360 27360 27360    =   a
27520 27617 27617 27617 27617    =   b
27266 27616 27360 27361 27616    =   aab
27521 27616 27616 27616 27616    =   ba

Password encryption/decryption is as follows.

Encryption process example.
484C as decimal is the value 18508
97F hex to decimal is the value 2431 (encrypt key)
18508 + 2431 = 20939, the value 20939 would then represent the ascii
characters "HL".

To decrypt we just perform the reverse of the operation above.
20939 - 2431 = 18508
Next, convert the decimal value 18508 to hex and we get 484C.
Finally, convert the hex value 484C to ascii to retrieve the plaintext
password of "HL".

CarbonFTP passwords less than nine characters are padded using chars from
the current password up until
reaching a password length of nine bytes.

The two char password "XY" in encrypted form "2496125048250482504825048" is
padded with "XY" until reaching a length
of nine bytes "XYXYXYXYX".

Similarly, the password "HELL" is "2086721956209392195620939" and again is
padded since its length is less than nine bytes.

Therefore, we will get several cracked password candidates like: "HELLHELL
| HELLHEL | HELLH | HELL | HEL | HE | HELLHELLH"
However, the longer the password the easier it becomes to crack them, as we
can decrypt passwords in one
shot without having several candidates to choose from with one of them
being the correct password.

Therefore, "LOOOOONGPASSWORD!" is stored as the encrypted string
"219042273422734224782298223744247862350210947"
and because it is greater than nine bytes it is cracked without any
candidate passwords returned.

From offset 0047DA6F to 0047DAA0 is the loop that performs the password
decryption process.
Using the same password "HELL" as example.

Ok, simple explanation after SetBPX in 47DA88...

At offset 0047DA8D,  97F is subtracted at [ebp-8] local variable which
equals the decimal value 2431 (hex 97F)
we also see EAX holds the value 55C4
sub eax,dword ptr ss:[ebp-8]
therefore, 55C4 – 97F = 4C45            <======= ENCRYPT/DECRYPT KEY
PROCESS.
mov word ptr ds:[esi],ax
add esi, 2  which is 4C45 + 2 = 4C47    <===== THEN

Given a two letter combination like "HL":
484C as decimal is 18508
97F hex to decimal is 2431
18508 + 2431 = 20939 = "HL"

Done!

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

[Vulnerability Type]
Insecure Proprietary Password Encryption

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2020-6857

[Affected Component]
Password Encryption

[Impact Escalation of Privileges]
true

[Impact Information Disclosure]
true

[Security Issue]
CarbonFTP v1.4 uses insecure proprietary password encryption with a
hard-coded weak encryption key.
The key for locally stored FTP server passwords is hard-coded in the
binary. Passwords encoded as hex
are coverted to decimal which is then computed by adding the key "97F" to
the result. The key 97F seems
to be the same for all executables across all systems. Finally, passwords
are stored as decimal values.

If a user chooses to save the project the passwords are stored in ".CFTP"
local configuration files.
They can be found under
"C:\Users\<VICTIM>\AppData\Roaming\Neowise\CarbonFTPProjects".

e.g.

Password=STRING|"2086721956209392195620939"

Observing some very short password examples we see interesting patterns:

27264 27360 27360 27360 27360    =   a
27520 27617 27617 27617 27617    =   b
27266 27616 27360 27361 27616    =   aab
27521 27616 27616 27616 27616    =   ba

Password encryption/decryption is as follows.

Encryption process example.
484C as decimal is the value 18508
97F hex to decimal is the value 2431 (encrypt key)
18508 + 2431 = 20939, the value 20939 would then represent the ascii
characters "HL".

To decrypt we just perform the reverse of the operation above.
20939 - 2431 = 18508
Next, convert the decimal value 18508 to hex and we get 484C.
Finally, convert the hex value 484C to ascii to retrieve the plaintext
password of "HL".

CarbonFTP passwords less than nine characters are padded using chars from
the current password up until
reaching a password length of nine bytes.

The two char password "XY" in encrypted form "2496125048250482504825048" is
padded with "XY" until reaching a length
of nine bytes "XYXYXYXYX".

Similarly, the password "HELL" is "2086721956209392195620939" and again is
padded since its length is less than nine bytes.

Therefore, we will get several cracked password candidates like: "HELLHELL
| HELLHEL | HELLH | HELL | HEL | HE | HELLHELLH"
However, the longer the password the easier it becomes to crack them, as we
can decrypt passwords in one
shot without having several candidates to choose from with one of them
being the correct password.

Therefore, "LOOOOONGPASSWORD!" is stored as the encrypted string
"219042273422734224782298223744247862350210947"
and because it is greater than nine bytes it is cracked without any
candidate passwords returned.

From offset 0047DA6F to 0047DAA0 is the loop that performs the password
decryption process.
Using the same password "HELL" as example.

Ok, simple explanation after SetBPX in 47DA88...

At offset 0047DA8D,  97F is subtracted at [ebp-8] local variable which
equals the decimal value 2431 (hex 97F)
we also see EAX holds the value 55C4
sub eax,dword ptr ss:[ebp-8]
therefore, 55C4 – 97F = 4C45            <======= ENCRYPT/DECRYPT KEY
PROCESS.
mov word ptr ds:[esi],ax
add esi, 2  which is 4C45 + 2 = 4C47    <===== THEN

Given a two letter combination like "HL":
484C as decimal is 18508
97F hex to decimal is 2431
18508 + 2431 = 20939 = "HL"

Done!

CarbonFTP v1.4
CarbonFTP is a file synchronization tool that enables you to synch local files with a remote FTP server and vice versa.
It provides a step-by-step wizard to select the folders to be synchronized, the direction of the synchronization and option
to set file masks to limit the transfer to specific file types. Your settings can be saved as projects, so they can be
quickly re-used later.

[Vulnerability Type]
Insecure Proprietary Password Encryption
[CVE Reference]
CVE-2020-6857
[Affected Component]
Password Encryption
[Impact Escalation of Privileges]
true
[Impact Information Disclosure]
true
[Security Issue]
CarbonFTP v1.4 uses insecure proprietary password encryption with a hard-coded weak encryption key.
The key for locally stored FTP server passwords is hard-coded in the binary. Passwords encoded as hex
are coverted to decimal which is then computed by adding the key "97F" to the result. The key 97F seems
to be the same for all executables across all systems. Finally, passwords are stored as decimal values.
If a user chooses to save the project the passwords are stored in ".CFTP" local configuration files.
They can be found under "C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Neowise\CarbonFTPProjects".
e.g.
Password=STRING|"2086721956209392195620939"
Observing some very short password examples we see interesting patterns:
27264 27360 27360 27360 27360 = a
27520 27617 27617 27617 27617 = b
27266 27616 27360 27361 27616 = aab
27521 27616 27616 27616 27616 = ba
Password encryption/decryption is as follows.
Encryption process example.
484C as decimal is the value 18508
97F hex to decimal is the value 2431 (encrypt key)
18508 + 2431 = 20939, the value 20939 would then represent the ascii characters "HL".
To decrypt we just perform the reverse of the operation above.
20939 - 2431 = 18508
Next, convert the decimal value 18508 to hex and we get 484C.
Finally, convert the hex value 484C to ascii to retrieve the plaintext password of "HL".
CarbonFTP passwords less than nine characters are padded using chars from the current password up until
reaching a password length of nine bytes.
The two char password "XY" in encrypted form "2496125048250482504825048" is padded with "XY" until reaching a length
of nine bytes "XYXYXYXYX".
Similarly, the password "HELL" is "2086721956209392195620939" and again is padded since its length is less than nine bytes.
Therefore, we will get several cracked password candidates like: "HELLHELL | HELLHEL | HELLH | HELL | HEL | HE | HELLHELLH"
However, the longer the password the easier it becomes to crack them, as we can decrypt passwords in one
shot without having several candidates to choose from with one of them being the correct password.
Therefore, "LOOOOONGPASSWORD!" is stored as the encrypted string "219042273422734224782298223744247862350210947"
and because it is greater than nine bytes it is cracked without any candidate passwords returned.
From offset 0047DA6F to 0047DAA0 is the loop that performs the password decryption process.
Using the same password "HELL" as example.

0047DA9E | 3B D8 | cmp ebx,eax |
0047DAA0 | 7E CD | jle carbonftp.47DA6F |
Ok, simple explanation after SetBPX in 47DA88...
At offset 0047DA8D, 97F is subtracted at [ebp-8] local variable which equals the decimal value 2431 (hex 97F)
we also see EAX holds the value 55C4
sub eax,dword ptr ss:[ebp-8]
therefore, 55C4 â 97F = 4C45 <======= ENCRYPT/DECRYPT KEY PROCESS.
mov word ptr ds:[esi],ax
add esi, 2 which is 4C45 + 2 = 4C47 <===== THEN
Given a two letter combination like "HL":
484C as decimal is 18508
97F hex to decimal is 2431
18508 + 2431 = 20939 = "HL"
Done!

HP System Event Utility
The genuine HPMSGSVC.exe file is a software component of HP System Event Utility by HP Inc.
HP System Event Utility enables the functioning of special function keys on select HP devices.
[Vulnerability Type]
Local Privilege Escalation
[CVE Reference]
CVE-2019-18915
[Security Issue]
The HP System Event service "HPMSGSVC.exe" will load an arbitrary EXE and execute it with SYSTEM integrity.
HPMSGSVC.exe runs a background process that delivers push notifications.
The problem is that HP Message Service will load and execute any arbitrary executable named "Program.exe"
if found in the users c:\ drive.
Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\HP\HP System Event\SmrtAdptr.exe
Two Handles are inherit, properties are Write/Read
Name: \Device\ConDrv
This results in arbitrary code execution persistence mechanism if an attacker can place an EXE in this location
and can be used to escalate privileges from Admin to SYSTEM.
