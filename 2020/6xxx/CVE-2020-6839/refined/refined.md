The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6839.

**Root Cause:**
A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `mrb_str_len_to_dbl` function within the mruby library. This function is responsible for converting a string to a double-precision floating-point number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `buf` variable within the `mrb_str_len_to_dbl` function is allocated on the stack with a fixed size. When converting a very long string to a double, this buffer can overflow, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The stack buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution. 
- In this particular case, the ASAN (Address Sanitizer) detects a stack-buffer-overflow, terminating the execution of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing a specially crafted string as input to the `Float()` method after it's joined from an array containing nil values.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how this string can trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input string that is passed to the `Float()` method in mruby.
- It is not indicated if the attacker requires local or remote access. The provided context indicates the ability to run a crafted mruby program.
