Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B device handles the "ANSI Extended Symbol Segment Sub-Type" within the ENIP Request Path Data Segment.
- When processing a request with this sub-type, the device reads a subsequent byte as the Data Size in words.
- The vulnerability occurs when the provided Data Size is larger than the actual remaining data in the packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The device fails to validate the Data Size field against the available data in the packet. Specifically, it does not check if the declared size is within the bounds of the packet.
- **Buffer Overflow (Implied):** While not explicitly described as a classic buffer overflow, the behavior described where the device reads beyond the packet bounds is similar in that it attempts to read data where it does not exist which can be used to trigger memory corruption and denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. When the vulnerability is triggered, the device enters a fault state. This causes a loss of communication with the device.
- **Recovery Requires Physical Intervention:** Recovering from this fault state requires a physical power cycle of the affected device. This could disrupt industrial processes where the device is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network request via the EtherNet/IP (ENIP) protocol.
- **Specifically Crafted Packet:** The malicious packet must include an "ANSI Extended Symbol Segment Sub-Type" with an invalid Data Size field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B device.
- **Knowledge of ENIP:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of ENIP packets, specifically the Request Path Data Segment, segment types, and sub-types to construct the malicious packet.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-6086, which has a similar root cause but uses a different sub-type (Simple Segment Sub-Type) of the Data Segment in the EPATH. Both lead to a similar denial-of-service condition.
- The provided CVSSv3 score is 7.5, indicating a high severity.
