Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-6954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the insecure handling of sensitive data (specifically, the password for the "Content Update Wizard Setting") when testing the connection string. The application discloses this password in clear text via a GET request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that users cannot directly view the pre-configured password, but it is revealed in clear text in the GET request when testing the connection.
*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The password is sent in cleartext as part of the URL parameters in a GET request, which can be easily intercepted.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the cleartext password could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Content Update Wizard settings.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Depending on the capabilities associated with the wizard settings, further attacks may be possible.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could intercept the HTTP request containing the password if it's transmitted over an insecure network (e.g., unencrypted WiFi).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker positioned between the device and the server could intercept the HTTP traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device's network.
*   **Ability to intercept network traffic:** The attacker must be able to intercept the HTTP requests from the vulnerable device, or have access to the logs that contain these requests.
