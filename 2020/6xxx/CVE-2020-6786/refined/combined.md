## Summary

Multiple Bosch software applications are affected by a security vulnerability, which potentially allows an attacker to load additional code in the form of DLLs (commonly known as âDLL Hijackingâ or âDLL Preloadingâ). This code is executed during the start of the vulnerable application and in the context of the user.

Bosch rates these vulnerabilities with a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 7.8 (High) and recommends customers to use updated installers for (re)installations and to use updated versions of portable applications.

For BVMS and BVMS Viewer, customers are recommended to completely update the installed product to the latest version as not only the installer, but also parts of the products themselves are affected by the vulnerability.

If a software update is not provided, customers are recommended to follow the mitigations and workarounds described in this advisory.

The Bosch IP Helper vulnerability was discovered and disclosed to Bosch by the external researcher Nir Yehoshua.

The vulnerability in the Bosch Video Client Installer was discovered and disclosed to Bosch by the external researcher Eli Paz of CyberArk.

The vulnerability in the Bosch Monitor Wall Installer and Bosch Video Streaming Gateway Installer was discovered and disclosed to Bosch by the external researcher Dhiraj Mishra.

## Solution and Mitigations

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the affected Bosch software applications to a fixed version. If an update is not available, users are recommended to follow the mitigations and workarounds described in the following section.

Please note that for affected installers, potential exploitation is limited to the time of installation. For future (re)installations, using an updated installer or applying the workarounds outlined in this advisory is recommended.

### General system configuration

Non-installed software (e.g.Â installers themselves and portable applications) should not be executed from directories, which are accessible by other users, or directories, where potentially malicious DLLs could be located (e.g.Â the default âDownloadsâ directory).

Installers and portable applications have no point of reference for a âknown good directory/binariesâ. The potential impact for these kinds of software depends on the directory from which an installer or portable application is loaded (âAppDirâ):

* Default âDownloadsâ directory: Malicious binaries may reside in a userâs default Downloads folder due to prior user interaction (e.g.Â clicking on a malicious download link, visiting a site which manages to execute a drive-by-download) and could be loaded by an executable. As a mitigation, users are recommended to move executables from the Downloads directory to new separated directories not accessible by other users and only start the executables from there.

  In general, we recommend not to execute installers or other applications directly from the default Downloads directory and not to accept unsolicited download prompts in a browser.
* Directories where multiple low-privileged users have access to: If such a directory is not created by the software itself (e.g.Â a temporary directory during installation time), this is essentially an unprotected Installation Directory and therefore a vulnerable system configuration. We strongly recommend not to place executables into a directory where other low-privileged users have write permissions.

  Please note that user-created directories under
  `C:`
  (e.g.
  `C:\MyNewFolder`
  ) would inherit write permissions for all users and are therefore strongly discouraged.
