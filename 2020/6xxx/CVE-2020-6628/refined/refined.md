The provided content relates to CVE-2020-6628.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `decompile_SWITCH` function within the `libming` library. This overflow occurs when processing a crafted SWF file, specifically during the decompilation of `SWITCH` action codes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A buffer allocated on the heap is overflowed when reading data related to the `SWITCH` action code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: The heap overflow can overwrite adjacent heap memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of Service: The overflow can also cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted SWF file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted SWF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable application with a specially crafted SWF file.
