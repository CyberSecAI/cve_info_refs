Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6079:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `rr_decode` function within the `libmicrodns` library. This function is responsible for decoding domain names in mDNS messages. It allocates memory for the decoded name but doesn't free it if an error occurs during the decoding process. Specifically, this happens when conditions at [8] or [9] within `rr_read_RR` are met, causing `rr_decode` to return NULL and the allocated memory not to be freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary issue is a memory leak due to the failure to free allocated memory in certain error conditions within the `rr_decode` function and propagated by `rr_read` and `rr_read_RR`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending specially crafted mDNS messages with malformed resource records can cause the memory leak to accumulate, leading to resource exhaustion, and eventually causing the affected service (VLC) to crash.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted mDNS packets over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system running the vulnerable software (VLC).

**Additional Notes:**

- The Talos report mentions that the conditions at [8] and [9] are not directly reachable due to a bug mentioned in TALOS-2020-1000, however, it also points out that similar behavior can be triggered by an invalid record that causes the function `rr_read` to return NULL which doesn't free the allocated `entry->name` buffer.
- The `rr_decode` function allocates memory via `malloc` but doesn't free the `ss` pointer if an error is encountered in certain conditions. The responsibility for freeing this memory is on the caller side, but the caller (`rr_read_RR`) does not perform the free.
- The vulnerability is located within the handling of resource records, and is triggered during parsing the resource record name in `rr_decode`.
- This vulnerability, combined with others, could potentially be leveraged for remote code execution, however, this has not been seen in the wild.
- The fix for this issue is to update to libmicrodns >= 0.1.2, and in affected applications such as VLC to version 3.0.9
