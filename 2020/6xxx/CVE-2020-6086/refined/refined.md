The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6086.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the "Data Size" field within the ENIP (EtherNet/IP) Request Path Data Segment of Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B devices. When the "Simple Segment Sub-Type" is used, the device interprets the byte following the sub-type as the data size in words. If this size is greater than the remaining packet data, it results in a fault state.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow (CWE-120):** Although stated as "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input" (CWE-120), it is more of a read overflow due to improper data size handling, leading to out-of-bounds reads. The device is attempting to read more data than is available in the provided packet.
- **Denial of Service:** The device enters a fault state when this out-of-bounds read occurs, causing a loss of communication until the device is power cycled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a complete loss of communication with the affected Allen-Bradley Flex IO device. The device becomes unresponsive and requires a physical power cycle to recover. This can disrupt industrial control processes relying on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network request to the affected device via EtherNet/IP (ENIP).
- **ENIP SendRRData Command:** The attack vector involves the use of the `SendRRData` command with a crafted Request Path (EPATH or IOI) containing a specific Data Segment.
- **Malformed Data Segment:** The vulnerability lies within how the device handles the Data Segment, specifically the Simple Segment Sub-Type with an oversized data size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device.
- **ENIP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the EtherNet/IP protocol, specifically the structure of the Request Path (EPATH/IOI) and Data Segments.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft the malicious ENIP packet to include the vulnerable Data Segment with an oversized data size.
