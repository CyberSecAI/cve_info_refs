- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `igcore19d.dll` TIFF parser of the Accusoft ImageGear library due to insufficient bounds checking during the processing of a malformed TIFF file. Specifically, the `loop_limit` variable, derived from a value read from the file, controls a loop that writes to a stack-allocated buffer. By manipulating the value read from the file, an attacker can control the `loop_limit` to write past the boundaries of the stack buffer.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787). The code calculates a loop limit based on a value read from the input TIFF file, and then uses this limit in a loop writing to a fixed-size buffer. A larger value leads to writes beyond the allocated buffer.
   
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can corrupt memory and overwrite return addresses, leading to control of the execution flow of the program.
   
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted TIFF file. An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to open a malformed TIFF file with software using vulnerable Accusoft ImageGear library.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malformed TIFF file to the victim. No special privileges are needed.
