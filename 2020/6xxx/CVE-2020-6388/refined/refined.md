Based on the provided data, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-6388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access within the WebAudio component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access: Specifically, this involves a read operation accessing memory outside the intended boundaries.
- Potential for heap corruption: The out-of-bounds read can lead to heap corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap corruption: Successful exploitation can corrupt the heap, a memory region used for dynamic allocation.
- Arbitrary code execution: By leveraging the heap corruption, a remote attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution. This would allow the attacker to run malicious code on the user's system.
- Information disclosure: An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the network.
- Crafted HTML page: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTML page.
- Video stream: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted video stream, which might be incorporated into an HTML page or accessed through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deliver crafted HTML: The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious HTML page to the victim's browser. This could be achieved through various means, including phishing attacks or malicious advertisements.
- Network access: As this is a remote vulnerability, the attacker needs network access to the victim.
- User interaction: The user has to interact with the crafted HTML page, typically by visiting it or having it loaded in their browser.

**Summary of technical details:**
- The vulnerability is in Google Chrome's WebAudio component.
- It's an out-of-bounds read issue that can lead to heap corruption.
- Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution
- A crafted video stream embedded in a HTML page is used to trigger the vulnerability
- User interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability
