Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the way Pixar OpenUSD parses compressed data within binary USD files (USDC). Specifically, this occurs during the decompression of the `FIELDS` section.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when reading compressed data from the file into a buffer on the heap. The size of the allocated buffer is determined by a `numFields` value read from the file, while the number of bytes read into the buffer is based on `fieldsSize` also read from the file. These values are independently controlled by an attacker and mismatched values lead to the overflow
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The code doesn't validate if the size of the data to be read (`fieldsSize`) actually fits within the allocated buffer size (`numFields`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting the heap overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted File:** An attacker crafts a malicious USDC file with specific values for `numFields` and `fieldsSize` that cause the buffer to overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the attacker-provided malicious USDC file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted USDC file with specific values in the file format to trigger the overflow.
*   **Ability to Deliver the File:** The attacker needs to somehow deliver the malicious USDC file to the victim, who would then need to open it for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the decompression process of the `FIELDS` section.
*   The provided crash information shows a crash within `libsystem_platform.dylib` during a memory move operation, further confirming the heap overflow.
*   The report also mentions that similar vulnerabilities exist in how the `FIELDSETS`, `PATHS` and `SPECS` sections are decompressed. Those are covered under CVE-2020-6148, CVE-2020-6149 and CVE-2020-6150 respectively.
*   Additionally, two related vulnerabilities exist in how compressed path elements are processed and path jumps, that are described in CVE-2020-6156 and CVE-2020-13493.
*   The vulnerability affects Pixar OpenUSD version 20.05 and was tested on macOS Catalina 10.15.3.
*   The vulnerability is present on Apple iOS and macOS due to USD format usage in the ModelIO framework.
*   Apple has addressed the vulnerability in iOS 14.0 and iPadOS 14.0.
