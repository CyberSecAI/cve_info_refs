# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1094

## Pixar OpenUSD binary file format compressed sections code execution vulnerabilities

##### November 12, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6147, CVE-2020-6148, CVE-2020-6149, CVE-2020-6150, CVE-2020-6156, CVE-2020-13493

### Summary

A heap overflow vulnerability exists in Pixar OpenUSD 20.05 when the software parses compressed sections in binary USD files. A specially crafted malformed file can trigger a heap overflow which can result in remote code execution. To trigger this vulnerability, the victim needs to open an attacker-provided malformed file.

### Tested Versions

Pixar OpenUSD 20.05

Apple macOS Catalina 10.15.3

### Product URLs

<https://openusd.org>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

OpenUSD stands for “Open Universal Scene Descriptor” and is a software suite by Pixar that facilitates, among other things, the interchange of arbitrary 3-D scenes that may be composed of many elemental assets.

Most notably, USD and its backing file format `usd` are used on Apple iOS and macOS as part of the ModelIO framework in support of SceneKit and ARKit for sharing and displaying 3-D scenes in, for example, augmented reality applications. On macOS, these files are automatically rendered to generate thumbnails, while on iOS they can be shared via iMessage and opened with user interaction.

USD binary file format consists of a header pointing to a table of contents that in turn points to individual sections that comprise the whole file. Format specifies that if the format version is 4 or higher, sections content is compressed. Four instances of a heap overflow vulnerability exist in a way USD processes compressed data of specific sections. These are `FIELDS`,`FIELDSETS`, `PATHS` and `SPECS`.

#### CVE-2020-6147 - USDC file format FIELDS section decompression heap overflow

Following code is responsible for decoding the `FIELDS` section data (from `pxr/usd/usd/crateFile.cpp`):

```
if (auto fieldsSection = _toc.GetSection(_FieldsSectionName)) {
    reader.Seek(fieldsSection->start);                              [1]
    if (Version(_boot) < Version(0,4,0)) {                          [2]
        _fields = reader.template Read<decltype(_fields)>();
    } else {
        // Compressed fields in 0.4.0.
        auto numFields = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();          [3]
        _fields.resize(numFields);

        // Create temporary space for decompressing.
        std::unique_ptr<char[]> compBuffer(
            new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
                     GetCompressedBufferSize(numFields)]);          [4]
        vector<uint32_t> tmp(numFields);
        auto fieldsSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();         [5]
        reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), fieldsSize);        [6]

```

In the above code, parser navigates to the beginning of the `FIELDS` section at [1]. If version check at [2] resolves that compressed fields are used, a 64 bit value of `numFields` is read at [3] and is subsequently used to calculate the size of the buffer at [4]. Another 64 bit value , `fieldSize` is read at [5] which is subsequently used to initiate a buffer read at [6]. Data from the file is read into buffer that is sized based on `numFields`, but is bounded by `fieldsSize`. Both values are under direct control and no check is performed to insure fieldsSize bytes can fit into the allocated buffer. This can result in buffer overflow on the heap.

#### CVE-2020-6148 - USDC file format FIELDSETS section decompression heap overflow

Following code is responsible for decoding the `FIELDSETS` section data (from `pxr/usd/usd/crateFile.cpp`):

```
// Compressed fieldSets in 0.4.0.
auto numFieldSets = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();           [7]
_fieldSets.resize(numFieldSets);

// Create temporary space for decompressing.
std::unique_ptr<char[]> compBuffer(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetCompressedBufferSize(numFieldSets)]);           [8]
vector<uint32_t> tmp(numFieldSets);
std::unique_ptr<char[]> workingSpace(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetDecompressionWorkingSpaceSize(numFieldSets)]);

auto fsetsSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();              [9]
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), fsetsSize);             [10]

```

Like in the previous vulnerability, parsing the `FIELDSETS` section starts with reading `numFiledSets` at [7] which is used to allocate a properly sized buffer at [8]. Then, `fsetsSize` 64 bit value is read at [9] and used as a read size argument to a file buffer read at [10]. Destination buffer size is calculated based on `numFieldSets`, but file read at [10] reads `fsetsSize` bytes. This constitutes an buffer overflow on the heap.

#### CVE-2020-6149 - USDC file format PATHS section decompression heap overflow

Following code is responsible for decoding the `PATHS` section data (from `pxr/usd/usd/crateFile.cpp`):

```
_paths.resize(reader.template Read<uint64_t>());                    [11]
std::fill(_paths.begin(), _paths.end(), SdfPath());

WorkArenaDispatcher dispatcher;
// VERSIONING: PathItemHeader changes size from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0.
Version fileVer(_boot);
if (fileVer == Version(0,0,1)) {
    _ReadPathsImpl<_PathItemHeader_0_0_1>(reader, dispatcher);
} else if (fileVer < Version(0,4,0)) {
    _ReadPathsImpl<_PathItemHeader>(reader, dispatcher);
} else {                                                            [12]
    // 0.4.0 has compressed paths.
    _ReadCompressedPaths(reader, dispatcher);
}

```

First, a 64 bit value of number of paths is read at [11] and a familiar file version check is performed. If the file version is `4` or higher, code at [12] proceeds to call `_ReadCompressedPaths` :

```
size_t numPaths = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();                 [13]

pathIndexes.resize(numPaths);
elementTokenIndexes.resize(numPaths);
jumps.resize(numPaths);

// Create temporary space for decompressing.
std::unique_ptr<char[]> compBuffer(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::GetCompressedBufferSize(numPaths)]);      [14]
std::unique_ptr<char[]> workingSpace(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetDecompressionWorkingSpaceSize(numPaths)]);

// pathIndexes.
auto pathIndexesSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();                [15]
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), pathIndexesSize);               [16]

```

Again, a 64 bit value of `numPaths` is read into a `size_t` typed variable at [13] and is then used to calculate the size of buffer allocation at [14]. Another 64 bit value of `pathIndexesSize` is read at [15] and is subsequently used as a buffer read size value at [16]. Since the destination buffer size is based on `numPaths` value, but file read size on `pathIndexesSize`, buffer can be made too small to fit the whole read which will result in a buffer overflow on the heap.

#### CVE-2020-6150 - USDC file format SPECS section decompression heap overflow

Following code is responsible for decoding the `SPECS` section data (from `pxr/usd/usd/crateFile.cpp`):

```
// Version 0.4.0 specs are compressed
auto numSpecs = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();               [17]
_specs.resize(numSpecs);

// Create temporary space for decompressing.
std::unique_ptr<char[]> compBuffer(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetCompressedBufferSize(numSpecs)]);               [18]
vector<uint32_t> tmp(_specs.size());
std::unique_ptr<char[]> workingSpace(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetDecompressionWorkingSpaceSize(numSpecs)]);

// pathIndexes.
auto pathIndexesSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();        [19]
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), pathIndexesSize);       [20]

```

As with previous vulnerabilities, a 64 bit value is read into `numSpecs` at [17] which is used to calculate the size of the buffer at [18]. Actual size of the section data is read at [19] into a 64 bit value `pathIndexesSize`. Notice the reuse of variable name, indicating code copy/pasting. This size value is used as a file read size at [20] and can result in a heap based buffer overflow if buffer allocated at [18] is too small.

#### CVE-2020-6156 - USDC file format path element token index decompression heap overflow

Section `PATHS` in the `USDC` binary file contains three arrays, each encoding parts of a path value. Similarly to already reported CVE-2020-6149, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a way compressed path elements are processed. Following code is invoked :

```
// Read number of encoded paths.
size_t numPaths = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();                              [1]

pathIndexes.resize(numPaths);
elementTokenIndexes.resize(numPaths);
jumps.resize(numPaths);

// Create temporary space for decompressing.
std::unique_ptr<char[]> compBuffer(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::GetCompressedBufferSize(numPaths)]);        [2]
std::unique_ptr<char[]> workingSpace(
    new char[Usd_IntegerCompression::
             GetDecompressionWorkingSpaceSize(numPaths)]);

// pathIndexes.
auto pathIndexesSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), pathIndexesSize);
Usd_IntegerCompression::DecompressFromBuffer(
    compBuffer.get(), pathIndexesSize, pathIndexes.data(), numPaths,
    workingSpace.get());

// elementTokenIndexes.
auto elementTokenIndexesSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();                  [3]
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), elementTokenIndexesSize);                 [4]
Usd_IntegerCompression::DecompressFromBuffer(
    compBuffer.get(), elementTokenIndexesSize,
    elementTokenIndexes.data(), numPaths, workingSpace.get());

```

First, at [1] , a total number of paths to be reconstructed is read. This value is used to calculate the size of compressed buffer at [2]. Then, at [3] , a compressed size of `element token indices` is read at [3] and a large buffer read at [4]. Notice that while the `compBuffer` is sized based on value read from [1], the value in `elementTokenIndexSize` is used as a read size argument. Both of these value come directly frome the file and, if mismatched, can result in a heap buffer overflow where both allocation and overflow size , as well as overflow contents are under direct control.

#### CVE-2020-13493 - USDC file format path jumps decompression heap overflow

Similarly to above, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a way path jumps are processed. Following code is invoked right after the previously discussed:

```
// jumps.
auto jumpsSize = reader.template Read<uint64_t>();                                               [5]
reader.ReadContiguous(compBuffer.get(), jumpsSize);                                           [6]
Usd_IntegerCompression::DecompressFromBuffer(
    compBuffer.get(), jumpsSize, jumps.data(), numPaths,
    workingSpace.get());

```

As in the previous case, destination buffer `compBuffer` size is calculated based on calculation at [2], but a second value read at [5] is used as a size argument to a `ReadContiguous` call at [6]. If the allocated buffer is smaller than the size read at [6], this will lead to a heap based buffer overflow.

In this case , the potential attacker controls both the size of allocated memory buffer, the size of the overflow as well as all the data of the overflow which comes directly from the file being read. With proper memory manipulation and control, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.
