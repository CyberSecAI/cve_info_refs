Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6506:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient policy enforcement in WebView.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Lack of proper policy enforcement within the WebView component. This implies that certain security policies designed to restrict WebView's behavior or access to resources were not being correctly applied or enforced.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is according to the Gentoo security advisory, which states that multiple vulnerabilities in Chromium and Google Chrome "could result in the arbitrary execution of code." While this statement applies to multiple CVEs, CVE-2020-6506 is among them.
- The Chrome Release blog post classifies this as a "High" severity vulnerability

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WebView component.  Since WebView is used to display web content within applications, it is likely this involves loading malicious content within a WebView that bypasses the intended security policies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to load or influence the content being displayed by the WebView. This could be achieved by tricking a user into loading a malicious web page.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Alesandro Ortiz on 2020-05-18
- The fix was included in Chrome version 83.0.4103.106.
- Gentoo also released a security advisory (GLSA 202007-08) for Chromium and Google Chrome, listing CVE-2020-6506.
