{
  "CVE-2020-6788": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element in the Bosch Configuration Manager installer. When the installer is executed, it may load DLL files from the same directory as the installer, leading to DLL hijacking if a malicious DLL is present.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a victim's system by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the Bosch Configuration Manager installer. This code will execute with the privileges of the user running the installer.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to trick the victim into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before the installer is executed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the victim will execute the installer from. No special privileges are needed other than user level access."
