# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-12

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 75

Announced
April 7, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 75

#### [#CVE-2020-6821: Uninitialized memory could be read when using the WebGL copyTexSubImage method](#CVE-2020-6821)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
Impact
high
##### Description

When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's `copyTexSubImage` method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

##### References

* [Bug 1625404](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625404)

#### [#CVE-2020-6822: Out of bounds write in GMPDecodeData when processing large images](#CVE-2020-6822)

Reporter
Deian Stefan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image larger than 4 GB in `GMPDecodeData`. It is possible that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1544181](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1544181)

#### [#CVE-2020-6823: Malicious Extension could obtain auth codes from OAuth login flows](#CVE-2020-6823)

Reporter
Leon Visscher
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A malicious extension could have called `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow`, controlling the redirect\_uri, and through the Promise returned, obtain the Auth code and gain access to the user's account at the service provider.

##### References

* [Bug 1614919](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614919)

#### [#CVE-2020-6824: Generated passwords may be identical on the same site between separate private browsing sessions](#CVE-2020-6824)

Reporter
Matthew Noorenberghe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Initially, a user opens a Private Browsing Window and generates a password for a site, then closes the Private Browsing Window but leaves Firefox open. Subsequently, if the user had opened a new Private Browsing Window, revisited the same site, and generated a new password - the generated passwords would have been identical, rather than independent.

* [Bug 1621853](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1621853)

#### [#CVE-2020-6825: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7](#CVE-2020-6825)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

#### [#CVE-2020-6828: Preference overwrite via crafted Intent from malicious Android application](#CVE-2020-6828)

Reporter
fatal0
Impact
high
##### Description

A malicious Android application could craft an Intent that would have been processed by Firefox for Android and potentially result in a file overwrite in the user's profile directory. One exploitation vector for this would be to supply a user.js file providing arbitrary malicious preference values. Control of arbitrary preferences can lead to sufficient compromise such that it is generally equivalent to arbitrary code execution.
 *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-6827: Custom Tabs in Firefox for Android could have the URI spoofed](#CVE-2020-6827)

Reporter
Juho Nurminen of Mattermost
Impact
high
##### Description

When following a link that opened an intent://-schemed URL, causing a custom tab to be opened, Firefox for Android could be tricked into displaying the incorrect URI.
 *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-6821: Uninitialized memory could be read when using the WebGL copyTexSubImage method](#CVE-2020-6821)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
Impact
high
##### Description

When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's `copyTexSubImage` method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

#### [#CVE-2020-6822: Out of bounds write in GMPDecodeData when processing large images](#CVE-2020-6822)

Reporter
Deian Stefan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image larger than 4 GB in `GMPDecodeData`. It is possible that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1625404#c0)• 5 years ago |
|  | |

This the security-bug version of [bug 1624451](/show_bug.cgi?id=1624451 "RESOLVED FIXED - copyTexSubImage2D must clip source rectangle to framebuffer bounds"). Unsure if we want to tip our hand and mark that one as a sec bug, since it started public.

webgl.copyTexSubImage supports reading from areas partially (or fully) outside the source resource. Since we would get undefined values (sec issue!) if we read out-of-bounds like this, we find the common subrect between the source resource size and the selected read rect. The WebGL spec defines out-of-bounds pixel reads as if they read zeros.

However, in this case, and with a destination texture image/slice which has never been initialized, and currently contains uninitialized contents[1], we neglect to initialize (oops) the contents of the image/slice before (safely) copying the valid source subrect onto it. This results in a careful copy into part of an otherwise-uninitialized resource, and the whole resource slice then is then marked incorrectly as initialized. (Subsequent reads from the resource will treat it as initialized, leaking the uninitialized contents)

The modern security model for GPU resource contents *should generally* restrict uninitialized data to within the process, not necessarily just from within the OpenGL context. Unfortunately for us, this means data could leak in from other GL contexts in the process. On Linux/Mac/Android, this should be only WebGL, and maybe Flash/Plugins, and we'll check if e.g. WebRender is affected.[2] Not all drivers we run WebGL on can be called "modern", so I have some concern that *leaked contents might be system-wide*, especially on older systems.

General exploit:

1. create a large uninitialized texture resource
2. copyTexSubImage from out-of-bounds of a source resource
3. read back the uninitialized/leaked contents
4. Exfil interesting leaked contents?

The hardest part here is (4), because:

* The possible sources of leaks are other GPU resources on the machine, probably (but not certainly) in-process only.
* It's hard to detect interesting contents to leak.
  + Maybe one could try to detect text, but you'll get an exfiltration dump mostly full of reddit.
* Trying to exfiltrate all data is not trivial, because it's all (large) images.

Due to the difficulty of an effective exfil path, I considered sec-medium, but sec-high seems safer because the core exploit up until exfil is easy, and exfil may be easy if you can afford to stream out a ton of images.

Non-minimal testcase: <https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/sdk/tests/conformance/misc/uninitialized-test.html?webglVersion=1&quiet=0&quick=1>

This has a high false-negative rate, so you may need to refresh a number of times before you see a (true-positive) failure. (in red)

[1]: Resource contents in WebGL are generally lazily initialized for performance reasons. On use, we lazily initialize the contents unless we can be sure the work would be redundant.

[2]: jrmuizel, do you know of any other GPU contexts in the client process?

We should probably add a killswitch pref for disabling lazy invalidation in WebGL in general.

Is ESR68 also affected? Patch grafts cleanly, so I guess so?

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Once you see it, you can't unsee it. I did my best to not mention the uninitialized aspect, so that's not obvious. However, any time you add clearing is suspect, if anyone digs into this.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Medium-low. This is a rarely-used entrypoint, and if it passes CI, it's probably fine. However, this sometimes-tricky code.

Based on the corruption I've seen (I'll post a testcase) I do think that this is generally constrained to in-process GPU data.

Testcase 'unaffected' result is one stretched green rectangle in the center of each snapshot.

'Affected' is any other color, or more than one green shape.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: sec-high: Leaks of system GPU memory (across processes on at least osx 10.14) in WebGL content, with ability to readback
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: STR in bug
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Some risk because this code is dealing with protecting uninitialized memory, and if it still fails in some corner cases, it will allow access to uninitialized GPU memory.
* **String changes made/needed**: none

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: sec-high
* **User impact if declined**: sec-high: Leaks of system GPU memory (across processes on at least osx 10.14) in WebGL content, with ability to readback
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 76
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Some risk because this code is dealing with protecting uninitialized memory, and if it still fails in some corner cases, it will allow access to uninitialized GPU memory.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: none

The advisory isn't quite accurate, though this does get a little tricky to describe accurately:

> Uninitialized GPU memory is leaked and could be read following a call to WebGL's copyTexSubImage2D
>
> When reading from out-of-bounds regions of a source resource with WebGL's <code>copyTexSubImage2D</code> method, the specification requires that the destination pixels that correspond to the out-of-bounds regions (of the source resource) are left unchanged. When the contents of the destination resource were marked for lazy initialization, destination pixels that correspond to the out-of-bounds regions (of the source resource) were marked as initialized without being either written to or lazily clearing the previously-uninitialized contents to zero, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

If Ken's name in the advisory is for identifying the security issue, Ken's original bug did not include the security aspect until the investigation I did above, though it did point out the fishy test result that precipitated my investigation. I'm not sure what the format for these advisories is.

I'm not sure either. Perhaps co-credit is appropriate. I'll see what Dan thinks....

Most times in this situation--where the original bug was not called out as a sec bug and a moz developer realizes the implications--we just throw it into the roll-up and credit the Mozilla investigator. Ken's original does point out suspicious results, and he points at a part of the spec that's talking about not reading outside the defined area. That might be close enough to co-credit him. But Jeff should get primary credit since he had the insight.

I wouldn't feel bad if we just threw this into the roll-up -- pretty easy to slurp images from other processes if you know this bug exists, and not everyone upgrades quickly. Hard to do much with the leaked data, though: easiest to recognize interesting bits and pieces with a human looking at them, but that would involve shipping massive amounts of data back to the attacker to sift through.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

I believe there is a potential out-of-bounds write in GMPDecodeData [1]:

```
  GMPDecodeData(const webrtc::EncodedImage& aInputImage, bool aMissingFrames,
                int64_t aRenderTimeMs)
      : mImage(aInputImage),
        mMissingFrames(aMissingFrames),
        mRenderTimeMs(aRenderTimeMs) {
    // We want to use this for queuing, and the calling code recycles the
    // buffer on return from Decode()
    mImage._length = aInputImage._length;
    mImage._size =
        aInputImage._length +
        webrtc::EncodedImage::GetBufferPaddingBytes(webrtc::kVideoCodecH264); // <-- pick huge enough _length such that _length + 8 overflows
    mImage._buffer = new uint8_t[mImage._size];                               // <-- allocate array smaller than _length
    memcpy(mImage._buffer, aInputImage._buffer, aInputImage._length);         // <-- copy _length bytes

```

I'm not sure if this is easy to trigger or if it's really any more serious than

a crash, but seemed worth reporting. Apologies if this turns out to not be a

concern.

a) could only apply to 32-bit builds (but that's valid)

b) \_length *and* the buffer it points to would have to be an actual memory buffer of ~4GB (which is very unlikely to be possible)

c) encoded input images are very likely constrained in size before this point (to way less than 4G), but that can be checked

d) adding a backup error-out-on-too-big (or release-assert) here wouldn't hurt even if c) is correct that this can't happen currently.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Not easily.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Attached patch should apply cleanly.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Very unlikely, this adds an assertion for a condition we're unlikely to ever hit.

@Tom can you give Fraser Brown credit too :-) She's the real hero that built the tool that found this bug.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
