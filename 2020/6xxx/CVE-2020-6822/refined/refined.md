Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **CVE-2020-6822**:

**Root Cause:**

*   An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `GMPDecodeData` function when processing images. Specifically, on 32-bit builds, the calculation of the buffer size (`mImage._size`) could overflow when adding `aInputImage._length` and padding bytes. This resulted in a heap buffer being allocated with insufficient size. A subsequent `memcpy` operation would then write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper size validation before allocating the buffer for image processing within `GMPDecodeData`.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The `memcpy` operation, using the potentially overflowed size, wrote data beyond the allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory states that with enough effort, the out-of-bounds write could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, an out-of-bounds write could also lead to a crash or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing images larger than 4GB on 32-bit systems.
*   **WebRTC:** The vulnerability exists in the WebRTC component of the browser, and is reachable through WebRTC image processing routines.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control input image size:** An attacker would need to be able to control the size of the image data being processed by the vulnerable code.
*   **Target 32-bit system:** The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit builds of the affected software.
*   **Web content:** The advisory notes the flaw can be triggered within "browser or browser-like contexts".

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report (Bug 1544181) indicates that the fix involves adding a check for large frames in `GMPDecodeData` to prevent the overflow and out-of-bounds write.
*   The vulnerability was rated as "moderate" impact.
*   The fix was applied to Firefox 75 and ESR 68.7 releases and later.
