- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to a lack of input validation when a user opens a specially crafted, malicious input file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure, or could crash the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious input file opened by a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious input file and have it opened by a user of the vulnerable software. The attacker needs local access, as the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
