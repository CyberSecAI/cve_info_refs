Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in an "inappropriate implementation in WebRTC". The vulnerability is specifically related to how WebRTC handles data channels. It appears that the memory address of a class instance was being used as a connection identifier, and this address could be exposed to a peer. This exposes internal information that is normally protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is the use of a memory address as a connection identifier in WebRTC data channels. This creates a potential side-channel information leak.
*   The specific vulnerability is that the memory address is exposed to the peer in the WebRTC connection, which bypasses ASLR.
*   The content mentions "heap corruption" as a potential issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a security mechanism that makes it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption bugs.
*   Exposure of internal address can lead to memory corruption.
*   Exploitation could lead to "heap corruption", which may further result in remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted WebRTC data stream. This would involve a remote attacker manipulating the WebRTC connection.
*   The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, meaning that they have some level of access or control over the network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate WebRTC data streams on the network. They must have a "privileged network position", implying a high level of network access to monitor or modify traffic.
*   **Crafted SCTP Stream:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious SCTP stream which contains a leaked internal address.
*   **User Interaction**: Requires a user to visit a malicious website or interact with some malicious web content that triggers the vulnerable WebRTC implementation.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   **opensuse.org/lists and fedoraproject.org/lists:** These sources mention "Inappropriate implementation in WebRTC" and list CVE-2020-6514 as being fixed in their respective security updates. They also relate it to "heap corruption".
*   **chromereleases.googleblog.com:** Provides a more detailed description: "Inappropriate implementation in WebRTC. Reported by Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero on 2020-04-30"
*  **security.gentoo.org** and **lists.debian.org:** These sources mention the CVE as a bug to resolve for firefox and thunderbird, respectively.

The content from support.apple.com identifies natashenka from Google Project Zero as the reporter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in Chrome 84.0.4147.89 and other related browser releases, as well as associated server updates.
*   The openSUSE and Fedora updates are tied to specific versions of chromium (84.0.4147.89), opera (70.0.3728.71), firefox and thunderbird, which address this issue.
*   The CVSS scores vary between sources, but all sources agree that the vulnerability is important and/or high severity. Some SUSE sources have a CVSS:3.1 vector of "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H" (8.8 score)
*   The vulnerability may not directly lead to remote code execution, but it is a critical step that compromises other security measures. The impact appears to be more related to an information leak that can enable further exploitation due to the bypass of ASLR.
*   The severity of the vulnerability stems from it being exploitable over the network and could potentially allow for the complete compromise of an affected system.
