{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TGA files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data when parsing TGA files. This results in a read operation before the start of an allocated data structure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious TGA file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable parsing logic.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with a malicious TGA file or visit a malicious page. No special privileges are required. User interaction is mandatory."
