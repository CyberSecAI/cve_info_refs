Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6077:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect bounds check and a flaw in how the remaining data length is handled when parsing mDNS messages. Specifically, during domain name decoding within the `rr_decode` function, the code incorrectly calculates the remaining bytes and allows out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Incorrect bounds check:** The `rr_decode` function uses `sizeof(len)` to check the remaining bytes, which is incorrect, as `len` is a 2-byte value. The check should verify if enough bytes remain in the buffer instead. This allows the code to read beyond the message buffer when resolving pointer offsets, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
2.  **Incorrect remaining bytes calculation:** The `mdns_read_header` function doesn't decrement the remaining bytes counter correctly, causing it to be offset by the size of the mDNS header. While not exploitable on its own, it could assist in evading detection of the other flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution:** As mentioned in the report, the vulnerability can potentially be chained with other bugs to trigger a double-free, and can lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker can send a specially crafted mDNS message.
*   The vulnerable code will process this message, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send mDNS messages to the target system.
*   No special privileges are required

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `libmicrodns` library version 0.1.0.
*   The `rr_decode` function, when processing compressed domain names, is the specific area of the bug
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H), which indicates a high severity issue.
* The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
