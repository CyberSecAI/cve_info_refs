The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `email` parameter in the `EmailCheckOthers.php` page is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89) in the `email` parameter of `EmailCheckOthers.php`. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches (reading sensitive information), data modification, or other unauthorized actions.
- The specific impact is rated as low for confidentiality and integrity and none for availability in CVSSv3. However, the severity is marked as 'Critical' due to the 'Scope' of the impact being changed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `EmailCheckOthers.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to make an HTTP request to the vulnerable page.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`email`) and the request structure.
