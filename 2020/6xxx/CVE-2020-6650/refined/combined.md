Eaton Vulnerability Advisory

General Security Best Practices

Eaton recommends segmentation of networks into logical enclaves, denying traffic between segments
except that which is specifically allowed, and restricting communication to host -to-host paths (for
example, using router ACLs and firewall rules). This helps to protect sen sitive information and critical
services and creates additional barriers in the event of a network perimeter breach. At a minimum, a
utility Industrial Control Systems network should be segmented into a three -tiered architecture (as
recommended by NIST SP 800-82[R3]) for better security control.

Eaton recommends opening only those ports that are required for operations and protect the network
communication using network protection systems like firewalls and intrusion detection systems /
intrusion prevention systems.
