- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Eaton UPS Companion software does not properly neutralize code syntax before using input in a dynamic evaluation call (e.g., "eval") within the "Update Manager" class when checking for updates. This leads to an 'Eval Injection' vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection') (CWE-95).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Arbitrary code execution on the machine where the software is installed.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability exists in the "Update Manager" class of the UPS Companion software, specifically during the process of checking for updates. The software uses a dynamic evaluation call on user-controlled input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to influence the input used in the dynamic evaluation call, likely adjacent to the target, as indicated by the CVSS vector AV:A (Adjacent). The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction (PR:N, UI:N) for successful exploitation. The vulnerability is exploitable in such a way that the attacker can take control of the whole system and data (S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
