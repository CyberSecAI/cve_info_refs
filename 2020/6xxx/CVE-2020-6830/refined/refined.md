Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6830:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of a webpage to override the `window.webkit` object in Firefox for iOS. This object is used for communication between the WKWebView (where web content is rendered) and the native iOS code of the Firefox application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Token Usage:** A security token intended to protect native-to-JS bridging (communication from native code to JavaScript) was being used for JS-to-native bridging. This token was not needed for JS-to-native communication and its inclusion in the message data resulted in the token being leaked.
*   **Overridable `window.webkit`:** The `window.webkit` object, which is essential for secure communication between the web view and the native app, could be overridden by a malicious webpage. This allowed the page to intercept and potentially modify messages sent to the native app.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Token Leakage:** By overriding `window.webkit`, a malicious webpage could intercept messages containing the security token used for native-to-JS bridging. This token, if misused, could potentially allow an attacker to bypass security checks and perform actions they are not authorized to do.
*   **Impersonation of Internal Messages:** A malicious webpage could impersonate internal messages, potentially leading to actions that could affect the browser or user data. Though the messages were not intended to be exploitable, the risk was present

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker could create a malicious webpage that uses JavaScript to override the `window.webkit` object.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to visit the attacker-controlled webpage using Firefox for iOS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
*   The attacker needs to lure a user into visiting the webpage using Firefox for iOS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the security token from JS-to-native communication.
*   The bug report indicates the severity was initially considered critical but was later lowered to moderate after analysis.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox for iOS version 25.
