#### [#CVE-2020-6830: Native-to-JS bridging security token exploit](#CVE-2020-6830)

Reporter
Vinoth Kumar
Impact
moderate
##### Description

For native-to-JS bridging, the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage was also leaking this token.

Firefox Version: v24.1

OS: iOS 13.3.1

Issue: Firefox iOS Security Token Hijack By Overriding window.webkit

Description:

Firefox iOS uses window.webkit.messageHandlers to communicate between WKWebView and ViewController and this communication is now protected by SECUIRTY\_TOKEN(UUID).

But in WKWebView A web page can override |window.webkit| with any value(overriding). The below code would get the SECURITY\_TOKEN to attacker controlled page when user visit's attacker's site.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    function getToken(msg) {
        alert(msg.securityToken);
        originalWebkit.messageHandlers.readerModeMessageHandler.postMessage(msg);
    }
    originalWebkit = webkit;
    webkit = {};
    webkit.messageHandlers = {};
    webkit.messageHandlers.readerModeMessageHandler = {};
    webkit.messageHandlers.readerModeMessageHandler.postMessage = getToken;
</script>

```

POC:

* Open <https://vinothkumar.tech/firefox-reader> your iOS firefox browser.
* Alert popup trigered with SECURITY\_TOKEN

Root Cause:

A web page can override |window.webkit| with any value.

Fix:

Deleting the object ensures that original and working implementation of window.webkit is restored.

```
var oldWebkit = window.webkit;
delete window['webkit'];
window.webkit.messageHandlers[handlerName].postMessage(message);
window.webkit = oldWebkit;

```

Rating would depend on what kinds of messages we're sending ourselves that, due to this, any web page can impersonate. "critical" might be overstating it. If it's just informational type messages it might only be sec-moderate or sec-low, but if it's browser actions that affect other origins or the user's data it could be that bad.

The messages should not be exploitable, the intention of this was an extra layer of security.

Most likely just removing the SECURITY\_TOKEN entirely, it has likely never worked, there was no specific bug for it being added, and was just a hopeful effort at adding an extra layer of security where WKWebView is lacking.

Removed use of sec token with postMessage(), which was a recent addition as an extra layer of security for js-to-native, instead it actually leaks the token. The other direction, native-to-js is unchanged.

>For native-to-JS bridging the app requires a unique token to be passed that ensures non-app code can't call the bridging functions. That token was being used for JS-to-native also, but it isn't needed in this case, and its usage in this case was also leaking this token.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
