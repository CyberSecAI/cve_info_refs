- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authentication for critical functions in the Bosch Video Streaming Gateway (VSG) service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The VSG service lacks proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to critical functionalities. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the handling of network requests through telnet ports 8023-8029.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve and set arbitrary configuration data of the VSG. This can lead to:
  - Impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of live and recorded video data.
  - Potential control of cameras configured to be controlled by the VSG.
  - Potential compromise of the recording storage associated with the VSG.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the telnet ports of the VSG service (ports 8023-8029).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable VSG service. No prior authentication or user interaction is required. The attack complexity is low, meaning the attacker does not require specific knowledge or controlled conditions on the target environment.
