The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6134.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `MassDropModal.php` page, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input from the `id` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- The vulnerability exists in the `MassDropModal.php` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is an authenticated HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page `MassDropModal.php`. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`id`) and the vulnerable page (`MassDropModal.php`).
