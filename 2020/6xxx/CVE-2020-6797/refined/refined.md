  "CVE-2020-6797": {
    "Description": "By downloading a file with the .fileloc extension, a semi-privileged extension could launch an arbitrary application on the user's computer. The attacker is restricted as they are unable to download non-quarantined files or supply command line arguments to the application, limiting the impact.\n*Note: this issue only occurs on Mac OSX. Other operating systems are unaffected.*",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles .fileloc files on macOS. These files, similar to .url files on Windows, act as shortcuts that can execute local applications.  A web extension with `downloads.open` permissions can download such a file, leading to the execution of arbitrary local applications.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file handling of .fileloc files",
      "Insufficient validation of downloaded file types by extensions",
      "Lack of restrictions on what type of application a file can launch.",
      "Ability of web extensions with `downloads.open` permission to bypass the standard file type checks."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker, by tricking a user into downloading a malicious .fileloc file through a compromised or malicious extension, can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's macOS system. While the attacker can't provide command line arguments, this can still be used to run programs that could leak information or damage the system.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "A malicious or compromised web extension uses the `downloads.open` API to download a specially crafted `.fileloc` file.",
          "The extension triggers the opening of downloaded file through the `downloads.open` API.",
          "The user may download the file and open it manually."
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to have a malicious or compromised web extension with the `downloads.open` permission.",
        "The attacker must convince a user to install the malicious extension and visit a page controlled by them or a compromised page.",
      "The attacker must be able to host the malicious .fileloc file or find a way to generate it on the fly and trick a user to download it"
