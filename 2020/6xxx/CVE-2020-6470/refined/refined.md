```
CVE-2020-6470: Insufficient validation of untrusted input in clipboard.
```

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
Insufficient validation of untrusted input in the clipboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
Insufficient input validation, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary scripts or HTML into the browser.

**Impact of exploitation**:
A local attacker can inject arbitrary scripts or HTML (UXSS) via crafted clipboard contents. This could lead to cross-site scripting attacks and potentially expose sensitive information to the attacker.

**Attack vectors**:
A local attacker needs to craft malicious content and place it in the system clipboard, and then trick a victim into pasting the malicious content using chrome.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
The attacker needs to have local access and be able to manipulate clipboard data. A social engineering component is required to convince the user to paste the malicious data into the browser.
