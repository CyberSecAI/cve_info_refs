The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report for CVE-2020-6063.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect calculation of buffer size when decompressing a PCX file. This occurs due to a signed integer comparison in the `PCX_parse_header` function, specifically when checking if `Xmin` is greater than `Xmax`. If `Xmin` is greater, the values are not swapped as intended due to the signed comparison, leading to an incorrect calculation of `sizeX` as `Xmax - Xmin + 1`, resulting in a smaller value than expected. This smaller `sizeX` is then used to calculate the buffer size for the `buff_mem_overwritten` buffer in `uncompress_scan_line`, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the `uncompress_scan_line` function.
- Incorrect buffer size calculation due to a signed integer comparison vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution due to the out-of-bounds write.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted PCX file must be provided to the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed PCX file to the victim. No special position or capabilities are required besides this.
