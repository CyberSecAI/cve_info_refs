- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue in AMD graphics drivers when processing a malformed pixel shader. Specifically, modifying the operand size of the `dcl_resource_texture2d` instruction can lead to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787). The driver fails to properly validate the size of the resource being declared in the shader, allowing for writes to arbitrary memory locations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can control the destination address of the write by modifying the shader bytecode.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted shader file to the AMD Radeon DirectX 11 driver. This can occur through different pathways:
    - HYPER-V guest using the RemoteFX feature, leading to code execution on the HYPER-V host (rdvgm.exe process)
    - Potentially through a web browser using WebGL and WebAssembly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed shader file to the vulnerable driver.
    - For the HYPER-V attack vector, the attacker needs to be able to run code in a HYPER-V guest and have access to the RemoteFX feature.
    - For the web browser attack vector, the attacker would need to serve a malicious shader that leverages WebGL and WebAssembly to trigger the vulnerability.
