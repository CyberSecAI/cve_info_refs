  "CVE-2020-6411": {
    "description": "Insufficient validation of untrusted input in Omnibox in Google Chrome prior to 80.0.3987.87 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via IDN homographs via a crafted domain name.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of untrusted input in the Omnibox component of Chromium.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient validation of untrusted input",
         "IDN homograph domain spoofing"

        "Crafted domain name with IDN homographs"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker needs to convince a user to enter a crafted domain name",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from how the browser handles internationalized domain names (IDNs), allowing an attacker to craft a domain that visually appears legitimate but directs the user to a malicious site. This is due to the browser not properly validating untrusted input in the Omnibox (address bar)."
