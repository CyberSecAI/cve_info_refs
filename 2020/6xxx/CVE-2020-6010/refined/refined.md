- Root cause of vulnerability: The method `_get_items` of the class `LP_Modal_Search_Items` fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data (the GET/POST parameter `current_items`) before using it in an SQL query.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Time-Based Blind SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation:  The vulnerability has a large impact on the system’s integrity and can even result in the platform’s takeover. An attacker may be able to extract sensitive information or modify data within the database.
- Attack vectors:  An authenticated user can trigger this vulnerability by calling the Ajax method `learnpress_modal_search_items`. The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL code into the `current_items` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An authenticated user is required to exploit this vulnerability.
