Learnpress is a good plugin for managing and selling courses. Very good plugin, really. It has a multitude of well-thought-out functions, the management is intuitive, many add-ons and if you combine it with Woocommerce (instead of using its native checkount), sales improve a lot.
The support is very dedicated and willing to help.
All of this being FREE.
It is almost at the level of paid competitors.
Bad things:
Could be improved in terms of performance speed. Requires page load reduction work.
Low integration with subscription systems for the sale of courses. There are plugins that help, you can sell by subscription with LP, but plugin could increase communication between the plugins and improve automations. (PMPO is not a good partner to sell subscriptions and the other two “big” subscriptions plugins aren’t be totally connected to LP).
The use of language files for translation could be improved.
But in general it is a very efficient plugin for a learning website and with many constant improvements.
And seriously, very good support.

# Blind SQL Injection

**Contributor(s):** kingthorin

## Description

Blind SQL (Structured Query Language) injection is a type of [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) attack that asks the database true
or false questions and determines the answer based on the applications
response. This attack is often used when the web application is
configured to show generic error messages, but has not mitigated the
code that is vulnerable to SQL injection.

When an attacker exploits SQL injection, sometimes the web application
displays error messages from the database complaining that the SQL
Query’s syntax is incorrect. Blind SQL injection is nearly identical to
normal [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection), the only difference
being the way the data is retrieved from the database. When the database
does not output data to the web page, an attacker is forced to steal
data by asking the database a series of true or false questions. This
makes exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability more difficult, but not
impossible.

## Threat Modeling

Same as for [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

## Risk Factors

Same as for [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)

## Examples

An attacker may verify whether a sent request returned true or false in
a few ways:

### Content-based

Using a simple page, which displays an article with given ID as the
parameter, the attacker may perform a couple of simple tests to
determine if the page is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.

Example URL:

```
http://newspaper.com/items.php?id=2

```

sends the following query to the database:

```
SELECT title, description, body FROM items WHERE ID = 2

```

The attacker may then try to inject a query that returns ‘false’:

```
http://newspaper.com/items.php?id=2 and 1=2

```

Now the SQL query should looks like this:

```
SELECT title, description, body FROM items WHERE ID = 2 and 1=2

```

If the web application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, then it probably
will not return anything. To make sure, the attacker will inject a query
that will return ‘true’:

```
http://newspaper.com/items.php?id=2 and 1=1

```

If the content of the page that returns ‘true’ is different than that of
the page that returns ‘false’, then the attacker is able to distinguish
when the executed query returns true or false.

Once this has been verified, the only limitations are privileges set up
by the database administrator, different SQL syntax, and the attacker’s
imagination.

### Time-based

This type of blind SQL injection relies on the database pausing for a
specified amount of time, then returning the results, indicating
successful SQL query executing. Using this method, an attacker
enumerates each letter of the desired piece of data using the following
logic:

If the first letter of the first database’s name is an ‘A’, wait for 10
seconds.

If the first letter of the first database’s name is an ‘B’, wait for 10
seconds. etc.

#### Microsoft SQL Server

```
http://www.site.com/vulnerable.php?id=1' waitfor delay '00:00:10'--

```
#### MySQL

```
SELECT IF(expression, true, false)

```

Using some time-taking operation e.g. BENCHMARK(), will delay server
responses if the expression is True.

```
BENCHMARK(5000000,ENCODE('MSG','by 5 seconds'))

```

will execute the ENCODE function 5000000 times.

Depending on the database server’s performance and load, it should take
just a moment to finish this operation. The important thing is, from the
attacker’s point of view, to specify a high-enough number of BENCHMARK()
function repetitions to affect the database response time in a
noticeable way.

Example combination of both queries:

```
1 UNION SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(user_password,1,1) = CHAR(50),BENCHMARK(5000000,ENCODE('MSG','by 5 seconds')),null) FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;

```

If the database response took a long time, we may expect that the first
user password character with user\_id = 1 is character ‘2’.

```
(CHAR(50) == '2')

```

Using this method for the rest of characters, it’s possible to enumerate
entire passwords stored in the database. This method works even when the
attacker injects the SQL queries and the content of the vulnerable page
doesn’t change.

Obviously, in this example, the names of the tables and the number of
columns was specified. However, it’s possible to guess them or check
with a trial and error method.

Databases other than MySQL also have time-based functions which allow
them to be used for time-based attacks:

* MS SQL: `'WAIT FOR DELAY '0:0:10''`
* PostgreSQL: `pg_sleep()`

Conducting Blind SQL Injection attacks manually is very time
consuming, but there are a lot of tools which automate this process. One
of them is [SQLMap](http://sqlmap.org/) partly developed within OWASP
grant program. On the other hand, tools of this kind are very sensitive
to even small deviations from the rule. This includes:

* scanning other website clusters, where clocks are not ideally
  synchronized,
* WWW services where argument acquiring method was changed, e.g. from
  `/index.php?ID=10` to `/ID,10`

### Remote Database Fingerprinting

If the attacker is able to determine when their query returns True or
False, then they may fingerprint the RDBMS. This will make the whole
attack much easier. If the time-based approach is used, this helps
determine what type of database is in use. Another popular methods to do
this is to call functions which will return the current date. MySQL,
MSSQL, and Oracle have different functions for that, respectively
`now()`, `getdate()`, and `sysdate()`.

# E-Learning Platforms Getting Schooled – Multiple Vulnerabilities in WordPress’ Most Popular Learning Management System Plugins

April 29, 2020

https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/e-learning-platforms-getting-schooled-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-most-popular-learning-management-system-plugins/

**Research by:** Omri Herscovici and Sagi Tzadik

#### **Overview**

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we live and work. “Sheltering in place” requires many people to work from home, thereby necessitating the use of virtual environments. The pandemic has also affected students globally, who are now at home learning via virtual classrooms online. This, in turn, has required many educational establishments to quickly integrate new Learning Management Systems into their platforms.

Learning Management Systems are E-Learning platforms used for delivering educational courses and training programs remotely. Not only university students use LMS; it’s for anyone interested in online learning.

In light of the increasing popularity of these platforms, we decided to audit the security of a few of them. Despite the somewhat shady reputation of WordPress plugins, they are still heavily used and are an integral part of most WordPress websites. This seems to be especially true in the case of Learning Management Systems, in which WordPress websites are the majority of the independent websites offering this service.

The 3 leading WordPress LMS Plugins are: [LearnPress](https://thimpress.com/product/wordpress-lms-plugin-learnpress/), [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/), and [LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com/). These platforms can transform any WordPress website into a fully functioning and easy to use LMS. The 3 systems are installed on more than 100,000 different educational platforms and include universities such as the University of Florida, University of Michigan, University of Washington as well as hundreds of online academies. The impact multiplies as it affects all of the students in all of these establishments.

We focused only on these 3 systems since they seemed to the most impactful in this category. The LMS we researched invested quite a lot of effort in their security and some even implemented a bug bounty program. And indeed, the bugs we found were not trivial and required reaching interesting sinks. Therefore, in addition to notifying the developers, we also decided to share some of them with the security community.

Our approach was to see if a motivated student can accomplish the childhood dream of every hacker – take control of his educational institution, get test answers and even change students’ grades. As we assume some of our readers might not be familiar with web application exploitation, we sorted the bugs in an increasing level of complexity, to make things easier to follow.

#### **Demo**

#### **LearnPress**Vulnerable Versions: <= 3.2.6.7

LearnPress is WordPress’ most popular LMS plugin, as it enables website managers to easily create and sell online courses. According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/LearnPress), it is the second most popular internet platform in the Learning Management System category, and the most popular one in the United States – more than Moodle (which is the dominating open-source learning platform worldwide), with a 24,000 installation base versus 23,000. Overall, according to the official [WordPress plugin website](https://wordpress.org/plugins/learnpress/), it has 80,000+ installations, and the [company developing the plugin](https://thimpress.com/learnpress/) states it is used in over 21,000 schools.

##### CVE-2020-6010: SQL Injection

TL;DR: This vulnerability is a [Time-Based Blind SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection) which is very trivial to identify and exploit. It was a surprise to find it as we would have expected that by now prepared statements were a part of the norm. Although these types of vulnerabilities are usually easy to spot, they should not be underestimated as they have a large impact on the system’s integrity and can even result in the platform’s takeover.

The method `_get_items` of the class `LP_Modal_Search_Items` is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The method fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data (the GET/POST parameter `current_items`) before using it in an SQL query.

An authenticated user can trigger this vulnerability by calling the [Ajax method](https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX_in_Plugins) `learnpress_modal_search_items` which executes the following chain:

Although the technical details of this vulnerability are not particularly interesting, we decided to include it as a point for comparison to the one we found in LearnDash.

#####

##### CVE-2020-11511: Becoming a Teacher

TL;DR: This vulnerability is a good example of legacy code forgotten behind resulting in a privilege escalation in the current design of the system.

The function `learn_press_accept_become_a_teacher` can be used to upgrade a registered user to a teacher role, resulting in a privilege escalation. Unexpectedly, the code doesn’t check the permissions of the requesting user, therefore letting any student call this function.

```
function learn_press_accept_become_a_teacher() {
   $action  = ! empty( $_REQUEST['action'] ) ? $_REQUEST['action'] : '';
   $user_id = ! empty( $_REQUEST['user_id'] ) ? $_REQUEST['user_id'] : '';
   if ( ! $action || ! $user_id || ( $action != 'accept-to-be-teacher' ) ) {
       return;
   }
   if ( ! learn_press_user_maybe_is_a_teacher( $user_id ) ) {
       $be_teacher = new WP_User( $user_id );
       $be_teacher->set_role( LP_TEACHER_ROLE );
       delete_transient( 'learn_press_become_teacher_sent_' . $user_id );
       do_action( 'learn_press_user_become_a_teacher', $user_id );
       $redirect = add_query_arg( 'become-a-teacher-accepted', 'yes' );
       $redirect = remove_query_arg( 'action', $redirect );
       wp_redirect( $redirect );
   }
}
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'learn_press_accept_become_a_teacher' );
...
```

This function is invoked [once the activated plugins have been loaded](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/plugins_loaded/), meaning that it can be called by simply supplying the `action` and `user_id` parameters to `/wpadmin/`, without even having to log in.

Just prior to releasing the blog we found that this vulnerability was a duplicate and was also discovered by [Wordfence](http://wordfence.com/blog/2020/04/high-severity-vulnerabilities-patched-in-learnpress/).

Both of the vulnerabilities we reported received the same treatment from the author – the vulnerable functions were completely purged from the new patched version. A classic case of *“the best code is no code at all”*.

#### **LearnDash**Vulnerable Versions: < 3.1.6

LearnDash is a leading WordPress LMS plugin. According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/LearnDash), over 33,000 websites currently run LearnDash. LearnDash also [stated](https://www.learndash.com/about/) to have been integrated into Fortune 500 companies as well as leading universities such as the University of Florida, University of Michigan, and University of Washington.

#####

##### CVE-2020-6009: Unauthenticated Second-Order SQL Injection

TL;DR: This vulnerability is easy to spot but much harder to exploit, as it is not a simple case of incorporating untrusted user input directly into an SQL query. But this too, like any other SQL Injection, could have easily been prevented by the use of prepared statements.

The function `learndash_get_course_groups` in the `ld-groups.php` file is vulnerable to [Second-Order SQL Injection](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00100210_sql-injection-second-order). This function fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data (although it is queried from the database, so one might assume it is safe) before using it in an SQL query. This vulnerability can be triggered without authentication.

Let’s have a look at the vulnerable function `learndash_get_course_groups`:

```
function learndash_get_course_groups( $course_id = 0, $bypass_transient = false ) {
...
        $sql_str = $wpdb->prepare("SELECT DISTINCT REPLACE(meta_key, 'learndash_group_enrolled_', '') FROM ". $wpdb->postmeta ." WHERE meta_key LI​KE %s AND post_id = %d and meta_value != ''", 'learndash_group_enrolled_%', $course_id );
...
        $col = $wpdb->get_col( $sql_str );
...
           $sql_str = "SELECT ID FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_type='groups' AND post_status = 'publish' AND ID IN (" . implode( ',', $col ) . ')';
           $course_groups_ids = $wpdb->get_col( $sql_str );
...
```

The function queries the table `wp_postmeta` for `meta_key`s of the format `learndash_group_enrolled_%`, for a specific post (`$course_id`). It then removes the `learndash_group_enrolled_` prefix and uses the rest of the value in another SQL query. This means that if we could find a way to insert a malicious record into `wp_postmeta`, where we control the value of `meta_key`, we would have an SQL injection.

Conveniently enough, the file `ipn.php`, which is responsible for handling IPN transactions, contains the following code:

```
...
// log transaction
ld_ipn_debug( 'Starting Transaction Creation.' );
$transaction = $_REQUEST; // <--- controlled input!
$transaction['user_id'] = $user_id;
$transaction['course_id'] = $course_id; // <--- controlled input!
$transaction['log_file'] = basename($ipn_log_filename);
$course_title = '';
$course       = get_post( $course_id );
if ( ! empty( $course) ) {
   $course_title = $course->post_title;
}
ld_ipn_debug( 'Course Title: ' . $course_title );
$post_id = wp_insert_post( array('post_title' => "Course {$course_title} Purchased By {$email}", 'post_type' => 'sfwd-transactions', 'post_status' => 'publish', 'post_author' => $user_id) );
ld_ipn_debug( 'Created Transaction. Post Id: ' . $post_id );
foreach ( $transaction as $k => $v ) {
   update_post_meta( $post_id, $k, $v ); // <--- this creates the malicious post meta that is later queried and used in another SQL query.
}
...
```

PayPal IPN is PayPal’s way to notify websites about PayPal transactions. Workflow:

1. PayPal sends a POST request containing information about the transaction to the website’s [IPN listener](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/ipn/integration-guide/IPNImplementation/). The data in this request is signed with the `verify_sign` parameter.
2. The website’s IPN listener sends the complete message back to PayPal using HTTPS, adding the parameter `cmd=_notify-validate`.
3. PayPal responds with either `VERIFIED` or `INVALID`.

You can read more about PayPal IPN [here](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/ipn/). PayPal’s [IPN Simulator](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/ipnSimulator/) can be used to craft IPN requests in a [sandbox environment](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/paypal-here/sandbox-testing/).

The code snippet from `ipn.php` effectively allows us to create a record in the table `wp_postmeta` (via the function [update\_post\_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/update_post_meta/)) with a `meta_key` and `meta_value` of our choice, which is later exploited to an SQL Injection by invoking `learndash_get_course_groups`.

Now that we can insert a malicious record in `wp_postmeta`, we need to find a way to invoke `learndash_get_course_groups`. Once again, `ipn.php` can be used to achieve this goal.

`ipn.php` naturally calls `learndash_get_course_groups` via the following call chain:
`ipn.php` → `ld_update_course_access` → `learndash_update_course_users_groups` → `learndash_get_course_groups`

We describe the exploitation process for PayPal’s sandbox environment for convenience sake, but this vulnerability exists in websites using the live environment as well.

The first step to exploit this vulnerability requires us to use the IPN Simulator to craft a valid IPN request. For the `$course_id` needed in `ipn.php` (`item_number` in the IPN request), we use `ID=1` (as it is never validated that this post is an actual course). Then, we extend the IPN request with the following parameters:
`debug=1&learndash_group_enrolled_1)`**INJECTION\_POINT**`%23=1`

There are three points that should be noted about this request:

1. `debug=1` causes the creation of a log file in the path `/wp-content/uploads/learndash/paypal_ipn/` which contains the `id` of the new post we just created which has a malicious `meta_key`. We need this post id for later use. The log file name that is created is simply `time()`.log, which can be guessed / enumerated. The post number can also be enumerated.
2. Usually, an injection occurs in the *`value`* part of the `key=`*value* pair (either in GET query parameters or POST parameters). In this case, our injection occurs in the *key* part of the *key*`=value` pair. We cannot use spaces there because PHP replaces them with underscores when accessing `$_REQUEST`. However, we can use `/**/` instead of spaces, as it is a valid character for the *key* part and is a valid replacement for spaces in SQL queries (`SELECT 1` is the same as `SELECT/**/1`).
3. We append `%23` to the end of our injection point, which is an encoded representation of `#`, to comment out the rest of the original query.

We now have to use the *post id* we found in point #1, and send an IPN request with `item_number=`*post\_id*. This triggers the SQL Injection.

This is what the executed query looks like:

```
SELECT ID FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type='groups' AND post_status = 'publish' AND ID IN (1)[MALICIOUS SQL QUERY]#)
```
#### **LifterLMS**Vulnerable Versions: < 3.37.15

LifterLMS is a leading LMS WordPress plugin. According to [BuiltWith](https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/LifterLMS), approximately 17,000 websites use this plugin, including WordPress agencies and educators, along with various school and educational establishments.

#####

##### CVE-2020-6008: Arbitrary File Write

TL;DR: An interesting example of Arbitrary File Write vulnerability, exploiting the dynamic nature of PHP applications – requiring us to reach an interesting sink in an unexpected way.

Since WordPress enables plugins to register new `actions` to its admin-ajax handler, the LifterLMS registered its own `handle()` function:

```
public static function handle() {
   // Make sure we are getting a valid AJAX request
   check_ajax_referer( self::NONCE );
   // $request = self::scrub_request( $_REQUEST );
   $request = $_REQUEST;
   $response = call_user_func( 'LLMS_AJAX_Handler::' . $request['action'], $request );
...
```

The function invokes `call_user_func` in `LLMS_AJAX_Handler`, based on the sent `action` variable. One of the available functions in `LLMS_AJAX_Handler` is `export_admin_table`:

```
public static function export_admin_table( $request ) {
   require_once 'admin/reporting/class.llms.admin.reporting.php';
   LLMS_Admin_Reporting::includes();
   $handler = 'LLMS_Table_' . $request['handler'];
   if ( class_exists( $handler ) ) {
  	$table = new $handler();
  	$file  = isset( $request['filename'] ) ? $request['filename'] : null;
  	return $table->generate_export_file( $request, $file );
...
```

The function first creates a new class based on the `handler` variable sent to it, and then calls its `generate_export_file` function with the `filename` variable also sent in the request. The `generate_export_file` is an inherited function that should create a CSV file based on the information pulled in the correspondent `LLMS_Table` class we created using the `handler` variable.

However, the code fails to verify that the extension in the `filename` variable is indeed a CSV. The reason is because when no `$type` is sent, it defaults to CSV.

```
public function generate_export_file( $args = array(), $filename = null, $type = 'csv' ) {
   if ( 'csv' !== $type ) {
  	return false;
   }
..
$file_path   = LLMS_TMP_DIR . $filename;
…
$handle = @fopen( $file_path, 'a+' );
...
```

At this point, an attacker can intercept a standard Ajax request, and use the `ajax_nonce` variable, created organically, to reach the `generate_export_file` with a `filename` that creates PHP files in an arbitrary location.

This bug enables an attacker to write PHP files, but without any control over the content. However, one of the `LLMS_Tables` we can use is `LLMS_Tables_Course_Students`.

The registered student can easily check what `courses id` he is registered to, and send it in the Ajax request. This outputs his name to the generated file.

The user can go to his profile page and change his first name to a desired PHP code, i.e `TEST <?php phpinfo(); /*`.

The WordPress input filter mechanism doesn’t allow for both opening and closing angle brackets (`< >`) in the same input, but since PHP is a forgiving language, we can use only the opening angle bracket anywhere in the file, and comment out the rest of the content using (`/*`).

At this point, simply browsing to the generated PHP file executes the PHP code written in the user’s first name – effectively achieving code execution on the server.

#### Impact

* Stealing personal information just like in any other compromised platform that has registered users (names, emails, usernames, passwords, etc…)
* The platforms involve payment, therefore, financial schemes are also applicable in the case of modifying the website without webmaster’s information
* Student specific:

* + changing grades for themselves
  + changing grades for peers
  + certificate forgery
  + retrieving the test beforehand
  + retrieve tests answers
  + escalate their privileges to that of a teacher

#### Summary

We focused on 3 of the most common LMS plugins: [LearnPress](https://thimpress.com/product/wordpress-lms-plugin-learnpress/), [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/) and [LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com/), and found vulnerabilities ranging from Privilege Escalation through SQL Injection up to full Remote Code Execution.

In total, we found 4 vulnerabilities that were assigned CVE-2020-6008, CVE-2020-6009 and CVE-2020-6010 and one duplicate CVE-2020-11511.

These vulnerabilities allow students and sometimes even unauthenticated users to gain sensitive information, edit personal records, and even take control of the LMS platforms.

Due to the recent increase in the popularity of E-Learning platforms, these are urgent issues. The developers have since released fixes to the platforms.

We urge users to upgrade to the latest versions of these platforms:

* LifterLMS – <https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/lifterlms.3.37.16.zip>
* LearnPress – <https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/learnpress.3.2.6.9.zip>
* LearnDash – <https://www.learndash.com/>

Learnpress is a good plugin for managing and selling courses. Very good plugin, really. It has a multitude of well-thought-out functions, the management is intuitive, many add-ons and if you combine it with Woocommerce (instead of using its native checkount), sales improve a lot.
The support is very dedicated and willing to help.
All of this being FREE.
It is almost at the level of paid competitors.
Bad things:
Could be improved in terms of performance speed. Requires page load reduction work.
Low integration with subscription systems for the sale of courses. There are plugins that help, you can sell by subscription with LP, but plugin could increase communication between the plugins and improve automations. (PMPO is not a good partner to sell subscriptions and the other two “big” subscriptions plugins aren’t be totally connected to LP).
The use of language files for translation could be improved.
But in general it is a very efficient plugin for a learning website and with many constant improvements.
And seriously, very good support.
