Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6208

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation for the existence of an object before performing operations on it when parsing RPT files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*  Use-After-Free: The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, where a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This occurs due to the lack of proper object existence validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Malicious RPT File: An attacker crafts a malicious RPT file that, when opened by a vulnerable version of SAP Crystal Reports, triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
* Malicious Page: An attacker can embed the malicious RPT file in a web page that, when visited by the user, exploits the vulnerability via browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* User Interaction: The user must either open a malicious RPT file or visit a malicious web page.
* Low Privileges: The attacker only requires low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that SAP has released an update to address this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-11-06, with a public release on 2020-03-12.
