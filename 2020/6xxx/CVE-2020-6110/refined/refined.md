The content is related to CVE-2020-6110.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Zoom client application does not validate the contents of a zip file before extracting it, allowing for arbitrary file writes and partial path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of zip file contents
- Partial path traversal during zip file extraction
- Handling of previously downloaded files with different file type indicators

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary binary planting
- Potential for arbitrary code execution
- Overwriting of important files

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted chat message containing a malicious zip file.
- Exploiting the code snippet feature to deliver the malicious zip file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send XMPP messages to a target user or group via Zoom chat.
- Knowledge of Zoomâ€™s file sharing and code snippet mechanisms.
- In one scenario, user interaction is required, where the target user needs to click a file shared via chat and save it to a location.
