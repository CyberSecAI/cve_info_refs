Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6095:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `GstRTSPAuth` functionality of the GStreamer RTSP server library. Specifically, the issue occurs during the handling of Basic authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `default_authenticate` function in `rtsp-auth.c` does not validate that the `authorization` field of a `GstRTSPAuthCredential` structure is not NULL before using it as a key in a hash table lookup.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The `g_str_hash` function, used by the hash table, dereferences a pointer without ensuring it is not NULL. When an invalid or malformed `Authorization` header (specifically lacking or having a NULL authorization field within the credentials) is provided, a NULL pointer is passed to `g_str_hash`, causing a crash.
- **Lack of NULL check:** The code doesn't check if the authorization value is NULL before passing it to the g_hash_table_lookup function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the RTSP server due to a segmentation fault. This renders the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered via a malformed RTSP `SETUP` request containing a crafted or missing `Authorization` header.
- **Specifically Crafted RTSP Header:** An attacker sends an RTSP setup request with an invalid or missing 'Authorization' header value or with an excessively long Authorization header (> 4000 chars) which results in a NULL authorization field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the RTSP server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials or prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Basic Understanding of RTSP:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a crafted RTSP `SETUP` request.
