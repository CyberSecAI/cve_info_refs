- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded MQTT service access credentials on the device.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leak vulnerability due to the presence of hard-coded credentials for the MQTT service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could use the hardcoded credentials to connect to the MQTT server and obtain information about other devices by sending specific topics.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to the MQTT server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to connect to the MQTT server and have the ability to send specific MQTT topics to obtain the desired information.
