Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an "Incorrect security UI in PWAs" (Progressive Web Apps). Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the way Chrome handles the display of the Omnibox (URL bar) within PWAs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Spoofing:** A crafted PWA can manipulate the contents of the Omnibox, allowing an attacker to spoof the URL displayed to the user. This can lead users to believe they are on a legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one.
- **Insufficient data validation**: The provided content mentions "Insufficient data validation in WebUI in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.89 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to inject scripts or HTML into a privileged page via a crafted HTML page". It's not clear if this is related to the PWA vulnerability but it was referenced in the same context in the provided text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing/Deception:** By spoofing the URL, an attacker can conduct phishing attacks, tricking users into providing sensitive information to a fake website.
- **Loss of Trust:** The vulnerability can undermine user trust in PWAs, as the visual cues meant to assure security are unreliable.
- **Potential for further attacks:** If a user trusts a spoofed PWA they may be more susceptible to further attacks such as downloading malware or other exploits.
- **Script or HTML injection:** An attacker could inject scripts or HTML into a privileged page if they have already compromised the renderer process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted PWA:** An attacker creates a malicious PWA that exploits the UI vulnerability.
- **User Persuasion:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to install the malicious PWA. This could be done through social engineering or other techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote as long as they can host and get users to install their PWA.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to install the malicious PWA, making user interaction necessary for this exploit.
- **Renderer Process Compromise (for script injection):** The attacker needs to compromise the renderer process of the browser for script and HTML injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects Google Chrome versions prior to 84.0.4147.89.
- The severity is rated as "Important" by SUSE, and "low" on Red Hat Bugzilla. The CVSS v3 base score was 4.3 and the v2 score was also 4.3.
- The provided content also includes references to other CVEs fixed in the same Chrome update, including those related to WebRTC, V8, PDFium, and more.
- Patches for this vulnerability were released by various vendors including SUSE and Fedora, also affecting Opera.
