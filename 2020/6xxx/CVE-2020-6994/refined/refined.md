- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper parsing of URL arguments leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120). The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specially crafted HTTP request to overflow an internal buffer during the processing of URL arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to full compromise of the device, allowing an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, network-based exploitation via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required, and the attacker can be remote. Low skill level is needed to exploit.
