Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-6507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds write in V8 (the JavaScript engine used in Chromium and Google Chrome).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write, which is a memory corruption vulnerability where a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted input to the V8 JavaScript engine within the browser, potentially when loading a malicious web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to get a user to load a malicious web page or otherwise trigger the vulnerable code within the V8 engine. This typically involves crafting a specific JavaScript payload that exploits the out-of-bounds write condition.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 83.0.4103.106 and Chromium version 84.0.4147.89.
