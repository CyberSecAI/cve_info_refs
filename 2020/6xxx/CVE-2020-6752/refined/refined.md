Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on the actions of group owners in OMERO. Group owners were able to perform certain actions as other members of their group, but these actions were not always confined to their own groups.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient access control:** The core issue is the lack of proper restriction of group owner's actions to their designated groups.
- **Context Handling Error**: The session context for a group owner was not limited to their group.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** A group owner might potentially be able to access or modify data in a group they do not own.
- **Unauthorized Modification:**  A group owner might be able to perform unauthorized actions within other groups, potentially impacting data or processes. The severity is considered low

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the OMERO server application itself.
- It requires a malicious group owner attempting to perform unauthorized actions beyond their own groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account with group owner privileges on the affected OMERO server.
- The attacker requires knowledge of how to exploit the group access control issues.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was resolved in OMERO.server version 5.6.1 by implementing a server-side check limiting the session context for group owners to their own groups.
- The provided CVSS score is 3.6 with the vector string `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C`, which confirms a relatively low impact vulnerability
