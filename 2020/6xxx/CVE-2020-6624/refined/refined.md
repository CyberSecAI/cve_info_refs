Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6624:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read in the `process_DQT` function located in `jpgqguess.c` file of jhead.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read: The program reads data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the jhead program due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the out-of-bounds read. This can be triggered by a specially crafted JPEG file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted JPEG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JPEG file as input to the jhead program. No specific capabilities or position are needed other than the ability to provide this file to jhead.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects jhead versions 3.03 and 3.04.
- The crash occurs in the `process_DQT` function at line 109 of `jpgqguess.c`.
- The AddressSanitizer output clearly shows the out-of-bounds read at address `0x60700000ddc3`, which is located outside the allocated region.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of JPEG sections, specifically during the parsing of DQT (Define Quantization Table) markers.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.06.0.1
