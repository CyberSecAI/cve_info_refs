- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow in the `compute_size` function leads to the allocation of a heap buffer that is too small. This undersized buffer is then used in the `fill_in_raster` function, where an out-of-bounds write occurs due to a loop that iterates based on the potentially overflowed size calculation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow, out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution due to the out-of-bounds write.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted TIFF file is provided to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TIFF file to a system using the vulnerable Accusoft ImageGear library.
