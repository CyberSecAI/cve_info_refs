The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6137.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the password reset functionality of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the `password_stf_email`, `uname`, `username_stf_email`, and `username_stn_id` parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the `/opensis/ResetUserInfo.php` page.
- `password_stf_email` parameter (CVE-2020-6137)
- `uname` parameter (CVE-2020-6138)
- `username_stf_email` parameter (CVE-2020-6139)
- `username_stn_id` parameter (CVE-2020-6140)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
- Access sensitive information like usernames and password hashes.
- Gain access to other data stored in the database.
- Potentially modify or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/opensis/ResetUserInfo.php` page. The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the vulnerable parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
