- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system uses MD5 hashing for passwords, which is considered weak and susceptible to brute-force attacks. This allows an attacker to recover user passwords after dumping the credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker with admin privileges can dump the credentials of other users and potentially recover their plain-text passwords. This primarily leads to a breach of confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator privileges on the affected system. They need to gain access to the database to dump the credentials.
