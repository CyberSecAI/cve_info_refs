This is the best plugin, for SSO functionality. I have used it about 4 times so far, on very prestigious clients. The support is stellar and the plugin does exactly what I need it to do. Very secure, very easy to set up. I got tech support after hours, live, and he assisted in setup immediately. I highly recommend this plugin.

We’ve been using miniOrange for several years to keep our internal website accessible to our employees. The rare times we’ve ever needed support your team was there to help!

This plugin is a excellent. I have used on a few projects and it works perfectly. You can tell a lot of thought and care went into its functionality.
What really stood out to me was their support. Anytime I had a question or needed help, they were quick to jump in and provide clear, helpful answers. It’s rare to find a team that’s this dedicated to both their product and their customers.
If you’re looking for a reliable SSO plugin and an awesome team to back it up, Sangu and crew are the ones to call. Highly recommend! 🙌

Vikram provided fast and reliable support. We solved the problem via a remote session that was painless to start. He knew what the problem was and was able to answer a few other questions as well. Very pleased with this plugin as we were quickly able to add Entra SSO to our internal and external WordPress deployments. Thank you!

I want to express my thanks for the great support assistance provided by Prathmesh Khokle in configuring our SSO. We ran into a few issues and he expertly and quickly sorted them out. He’s very patient, knowledgeable and a true professional. Thanks Prathmesh!
