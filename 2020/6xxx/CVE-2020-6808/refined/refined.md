Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6808:

**CVE Description:**

The official description states: "When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox handled the URL of documents created from the evaluation of a `javascript:` URL. The `document.location` property incorrectly reflected the `javascript:` URL instead of the originating document's URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **URL Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the URL displayed in the browser's address bar. This was achieved because the `document.location` property incorrectly reflected the `javascript:` URL instead of the originating document's URL.
-   **Incorrect Document URL:** When a `javascript:` URL was used to create a document, the new document's URL was incorrectly set to the `javascript:` URL, leading to confusion about the origin of the displayed page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to create spoofed web pages with fake URLs, potentially tricking users into revealing sensitive information.
-   **User Confusion:** The incorrect URL display could confuse users about the actual source and security context of the displayed page.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves crafting a `javascript:` URL that, upon evaluation, generates a string that is then parsed as an HTML document. The incorrect URL is then displayed in the browser's address bar.
-   The user would have to click on a malicious link or be redirected to a page with a malicious javascript: URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   An attacker would need the ability to get the victim to evaluate the malicious `javascript:` URL. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    -   Tricking a user into clicking on a specially crafted link.
    -   Embedding the malicious javascript: URL in a website that the user visits.
-   The attacker needs knowledge of Javascript and HTML to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was identified and reported by an external reporter, Abdulrahman Alqabandi.
-   The fix for this vulnerability involved ensuring that the `document.location` property and other URL-related information for documents created from `javascript:` URLs now reflect the correct originating document's URL.
-   The fix was implemented in Firefox 74 and was not backported to older versions.
-   The vulnerability was classified as "moderate" severity, given that it is mostly a UI spoofing issue.

In summary, CVE-2020-6808 is a URL spoofing vulnerability in Firefox where JavaScript URLs could be used to create a new HTML document with a misleading URL in the address bar. The fix ensures the document URL is the originating document's URL and not the javascript URL itself.
