| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

I dig a bit deeper today. The `0x616000010bdb` here is `destroy_pending: AtomicBool` in `AudioUnitStream` at mod.rs:3270

<https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs/blob/7fe03b4201160f84aad1c12536affe6b05f8839f/src/backend/mod.rs#L3270>

I suspect there is a *stream-reinit-task* posted to the global task queue in the cubeb context (*aka* `AudioUnitContext::serial_queue`) while *stream-destroy-task* is being executed in the global task queue, or `cubeb_stream_destroy` and `audiounit_property_listener_callback` get called at the same time and *stream-reinit-task* is posted after *stream-destroy-task* is posted.

Suppose there are 3 different threads

* *M*: the Main thread running the `test_switch_device` test
* *T*: the thread running the task in the global task queue (`AudioUnitContext::serial_queue`)
* *D*: the *device-changed* callback thread (where`audiounit_property_listener_callback` is on)

The timeline should be like this

1. *M*: Start running `test_switch_device`
2. *M*: Initialize *cubeb context*
3. *M*: Initialize *cubeb stream*
4. *M*: Start *cubeb stream*
5. *M*: Change the default output device
6. The default device is changed: The following works might be run at the same time
   * *M*: Get notification of the device changed
     + Do *5* again until it's repeated *X* times
   * *D*: If the *stream-reinit-task* is pending/being run, skip this event. Otherwise, post an *async* *stream-reinit-task* to the global task queue
     + *T*: Start executing the *stream-reinit-task*
7. The following works might be run at the same time:
   * After the default output device is changed *X* times, the test is about to be finished, so

     *M* start destroying *cubeb stream*, which posts a *sync* *stream-destroy-task* to the the global task queue. Then *M* is blocked until the *stream-destroy-task* is done.
   * While *M* is executing, the *D* is fired for the last device-changed event and then posts an *async* *stream-reinit-task*
8. If *stream-destroy-task* is posted before *stream-reinit-task*, *T* will execute *stream-destroy-task* first
9. *T*: Finishing the *stream-destroy-task*
10. The following works might be run at the same time:
    * *M*: Destroy *cubeb context*
    * *T*: Pick and run the *stream-reinit-task* after the *cubeb stream* is destroyed
      + *T*: Touching `destroy_pending` leads to a crash

At step *10*, touching the `destroy_pending` in a destroyed *cubeb stream* causes the crash.

Got some suggestions from Alex:

---

In addition to what you have, you could use the `if stm_guard.destroy_pending.load(Ordering::SeqCst)` inside the main body of `reinit_async()` in a way that we don't `async_dispatch` another reinit closure if this flag is true. In this case, you would also need synchronization between `destroy()` and `reinit_async()`.

If the solution is the above I guess the c-api is not protected by this problem, probably we haven't tried the same test.

Attached patch

[UAF-demo.diff](attachment.cgi?id=9126802&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9126802&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1614971&attachment=9126802)

I can make this happen manually with this patch in [version 7fe03b4](https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs/tree/7fe03b4201160f84aad1c12536affe6b05f8839f), by running `cargo test test_stream_tester -- --ignored --nocapture`, with switching device manually and dropping the cubeb context, stream by the test command, at the proper times.

This patch adds delays to force the context-switch at a proper time to demonstrate what happens and use `dbg!` to touch the memory that is free after cubeb context and stream is destroyed.

The device can be switched by clicking the sound device icon on the main UI bar then select one device on the system. To drop the cubeb context and stream, it needs to manually enter the correct command in the `test_stream_tester` test.

The whole log for the demo (`cargo test test_stream_tester -- --ignored --nocapture`) is:

(In reply to C.M.Chang[:chunmin] from [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio"))

Yes, this is reproducible in both C and Rust backend. The steps-to-reproduce are in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio") and [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix heap-use-after-free errors found by AddressSanitizer in cubeb-coreaudio").

In this case, you would also need synchronization between `destroy()` and `reinit_async()`.

Actually, I've tried this at first. But it doesn't seem to work (Not sure if I understand the suggestion correctly though). Since the reinit-task and destroy-task are racing, `destroy_pending` might be `false` even if `destroy` is called.

Another way I could think is to move the ownership of the task queue to the cubeb stream, instead of the cubeb context. The task will be created in the stream, instead of the cubeb context. Then when the stream is being destroyed, we can cancel all the pending tasks. However, there is [Dispatch Queue](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html) API that can do that. We may need to create a task-queue class by our own (and it needs to make sure it won't regress the data race fixed in [bug 1598413](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598413 "RESOLVED FIXED - Avoid racing issue when play/stop and reinit or destroy stream at the same time")).

Move the test log to the first line of the switch-device test. It will

be clearer about what's going on when the error log is printed.

[Bug 1614971 - Fix the UAF. r?padenot](attachment.cgi?id=9127642)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9127642&action=edit)

The UAF is actually caused by a data race between the stream-reinit task

on the device-changed callback thread, and the stream-destroy task on

the main audio thread. When the device is changed upon the stream is

about to be destroyed, the stream-reinit task can be posted to the

global task queue just right after the stream-destroy task in that task

queue. As a result, the stream-reinit task will be executed after the

stream is destroyed and cause a used-after-free error.

The solution here is to unregister the device-changed callback before

the stream is destroyed, on the main audio thread. The calls for

unregistering device-changed callbacks will block the current thread

until all the pending device-changed callbacks finish, and stop firing

any callbacks in the future. This makes sure the following things

* No device-changed callback thread will run while the stream is ready

  to be destroyed.
* No stream-reinit task can be appended to the task queue

As a result,

* There is no device-changed callback thread that races with the task

  thread running the stream-destroy task
* There is no stream-reinit task appended after the stream-destroy task.

(Note that the running data callbacks will be stopped in the

stream-destroy task, by stopping the running AudioUnits, before

destroying the stream.)

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: It's not hard to infer when the data race causing an UAF can happen by reading this patch carefully.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: For new Rust backend, it's FF74. For C backend, it exists for a long time.
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: For Rust cubeb backend, this patch can be uplifted to the FF74 easily.

  For C cubeb backend, it's easy to import this change from the Rust backend to C backend.

However, the cubeb code are in public github repos.

* main cubeb repo: <https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb>
* Rust cubeb on Mac OSx: <https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs>

The update will be submitted in github repos instead of being updated in the gecko directly. I am not sure how to hide the security vulnerability properly when updating the code. (One thing I can do is to update the code without commit messages or comments. The comments can be added in other separated commits anyway.)

* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It's a small change without doing anything that can change the behavior. The change here is to destroy the audio stream properly to prevent system callback from being executed after the stream is destroyed.

The code will be imported in [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725), instead of [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369). [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369) is created to hide the review in the public git repo, since the code is in a third-party library developed by *Mozilla*.

The commit message is simplied to *Destroy the stream properly* without any explanation. The title of [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725), *Update cubeb-coreaudio to 4acd802*, is a regular update title, as what we used to have in the past.

Can I carry the sec-approval from [D63369](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63369) to [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725)? Or I need to ask a sec-approval again?

> 4. Do not land the test change until mid-way through next cycle

Sure.

> I don't see a backport for esr68 but you said you had one, so please ensure esr68 gets it.

The fix is under review in another github repo: <https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb/pull/574>. It will be imported to gecko once it's merge in the repo's master branch. It should be similar to what we have in [D63725](https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D63725). I'll ask a sec-approval again then.

I've merged it now. Paul had already reviewed it, so it was just waiting on the merge.

It looks like I sent you an invite for cubeb repo access a while ago, but it must've gone missing. I'll PM you a new invite link.

I am not sure if this bug blocks [bug 863846](/show_bug.cgi?id=863846 "NEW - [meta] Maintain Firefox ASan build process and compatibility").

This errors are found by running Asan in the test of a [third-party audio library](https://github.com/ChunMinChang/cubeb-coreaudio-rs) used and maintained by Mozilla. The error happens when users unplug or switch the current output audio device. I don't think those tests are run in Firefox's test, and this won't be detected in the build process. Is there a better category, instead of *asan build*, to track this bug ?

* Firefox 74

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

* [Bug 1247968](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247968)

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

##### References

* [Bug 1420296](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296)

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

* [Bug 1613765](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613765)

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

##### References

* [Bug 1616661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661)

#### [#CVE-2020-6813: @import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature](#CVE-2020-6813)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
low
##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

* [Bug 1605814](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1605814)

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2020-6815: Memory and script safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74](#CVE-2020-6815)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Jason Kratzer, Boris Zbarsky, Tyson Smith, and Alexandru Michis reported memory safety and script safety bugs present in Firefox 73. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation of privilege and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1228754](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228754 "VERIFIED FIXED - Show about:blank (placeholder \"Search or enter address\" in the URL bar) using javascript URI scheme (spoof)") +++
(original test and steps from [bug 1228754](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228754 "VERIFIED FIXED - Show about:blank (placeholder \"Search or enter address\" in the URL bar) using javascript URI scheme (spoof)") and @qab, not from me)
1. Open attached file.
2. click link
3. click back button in the browser
Somehow, the URL stays in the URL bar. Interrogating the browser's currentURI shows the URL shown in the URL bar, but the document displayed is actually about:blank (and the documentURI and so on verify this, and document.documentElement.nodePrincipal is the original opener's principal (localhost if you host the file there, bugzilla if you opened it directly ).

You can spoof pages that contain in invalid character. So, for example, you can spoof a page that looks like '<https://www.facebook.com>`' (note the invalid character), so its not just websites with no certs. In my opinion most users would not notice the invalid character at the end. Also I assume there is a special character that is less noticeable than '`' which could be used.

One thing I'm noticing is that Chrome doens't put javascript: into session history. As an extremely simple test, I did:
location.href="javascript:'whatever'";
In chrome, the document does change, but URL bar, history.length and location.href remain the same. In firefox both URL bar and location.href changed to javascript:'whatever', and history length increases.
I don't see a clear reason to keep javascript: in session history, maybe we should change this behavior.
BTW I think that's also the reason I sometimes keep being redirected again when pressing back. Addons such as Wikiwand is using javascript: to redirect. I have impression that some websites also do.

Per spec, history.length should increase. Otherwise you get user dataloss: the user can't go back to the page that used to be there!
Also per spec the URL bar and location.href should become the URL of the document triggering the javascript: load or so. At some point we should really sit down and align this last bit with the spec... Pretty sure we have existing bugs tracking that.

I believe you're referring [bug 836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)"). I found the spec for document.URL stuff [1] and am still trying to better understand how spec describes session history behaviors.
It looks to me that the document.URL stuff is all we need for this bug. I'll see what I can do.

Hi Boris,
May I have your feedback and advices here? I'm trying to use the override URI as the URI for document, session history entry, and docshell's current URI, but I'm not quite confident about how it should be implemented. Does this look the right path to you?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

|  | |

If we want to take the "change the URI" approach, why wouldn't we just have the javascript: channel return the URI we want from GetURI, and presumably set the LOAD\_REPLACE flag so people ignore the originalURI?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

|  | |

Or perhaps even more simply, change which URI we pass to the NS\_NewInputStreamChannel call in nsJSChannel::Init, if we know which URI we'll really want at that point.

|  | |

In fact, I expect that the GetURI the nsJSChannel returns doesn't matter; what matters is the stream channel's URI.

No, don't do that! Fixing a bug elsewhere doesn't make a related bug INVALID. You could maybe use "worksforme" for an old bug that magically goes away, but if it's a security bug and you know what fixed it (as in this case, [bug 836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)") presumably) then you need to mark it FIXED.Depends on: [836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)")Flags: needinfo?(sawang)

Sorry I wasn't actively working on this recently. Made some attempts these 2 days but according to [bug 836567 comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)") I should be holding it for a moment.
