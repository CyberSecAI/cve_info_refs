```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strtok_r` function in the CoTURN web server's POST request parsing logic can return a NULL value if the left-hand side of the split is empty. This NULL pointer is then used in a subsequent call to `strdup`, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL Pointer Dereference",
    "Denial of Service"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted HTTP POST request can cause the CoTURN server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the CoTURN server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
