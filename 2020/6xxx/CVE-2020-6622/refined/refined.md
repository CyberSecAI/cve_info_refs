- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `stbtt__buf_peek8` function within the `stb_truetype.h` library. This is triggered when processing a malformed or crafted TrueType font file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `stbtt__buf_peek8` function attempts to read a byte from a buffer without proper bounds checking. This lack of validation allows an attacker to read past the allocated memory region, causing a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A heap buffer overflow can lead to various issues including denial-of-service (crashes) and potentially arbitrary code execution if the attacker can overwrite critical data in the heap. The provided crash report clearly indicates a program abort due to the heap overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by processing a specially crafted TrueType font file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable application or library with a malicious TrueType font file.
