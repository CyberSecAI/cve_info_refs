## Summary
On Tuesday Oct 8, 2019 a question in the dev/crypto gitter channel led to a vulnerability in the consensus protocol being discovered by the Grin developers. [CVE-2020-6638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6638) was reserved for this. The vulnerability was fixed in v3.0.0 as part of the required upgrade for the [scheduled hard fork on Jan 15, 2020](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-v3-0-0-hard-fork-upgrade-jan-2020/). This document provides details on the vulnerability, the fix, and what measures were taken to protect Grin users.
\*\*No action required by users. Nodes and wallets that are running v3.0.0+ are not affected by this vulnerability.\*\*
The vulnerability was discovered following a question on [Tuesday Oct 8, 2019](https://gitter.im/grin\_community/crypto?at=5d9bcc6f5173c33ca187d6cf) in the dev/crypto gitter channel. A malicious node could introduce \_block malleability\_ by crafting two otherwise identical versions of a valid block, differing only in the exact set of outputs being spent. This could have been used to force a chain split on the network, which in turn could have led to subsequent attacks on users being caught on the wrong side of the network split. \*\*Such attacks would have been exceptionally difficult to pull off in practice. There has been no indication or evidence of this vulnerability ever having been exploited.\*\*
## Background
### Third party disclosure
As per [Grin's security process document](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/SECURITY.md#bilateral-responsible-disclosure-agreements), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication. We have however determined that a few projects were vulnerable and have contacted them immediately upon publication.
As the consensus rules of the network requires running software that includes a fix, no additional action is required by mining pools, wallet software providers, or exchanges.
### Timeline of events
\* Oct 08 2019: Question relating to "UTXO vs. TXO MMRs" posted to `grin/crypto` gitter channel. Various private internal conversations discussing ramifications of this question took place, leading to an internal agreement that there is indeed a vulnerability. It's still unclear exactly how far-reaching or what precisely is impacted. Author of initial question contacted privately to request no further discussion takes place in public pending further investigation.
\* Oct 10 2019: Rough plan for fix decided on. Decision made to fix "quietly" and target scheduled HF2 (Jan 2020).
\* Oct 15 2019: Initial version of fix tested internally.
\* Oct 29 2019: Initial draft of "enable faster sync" RFC submitted as a PR to the `mimblewimble/grin-rfcs` github repo.
\* Nov 04 2019: Initial draft of PR for non-consensus breaking changes published to `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
\* Nov 26 2019: PR for non-consensus breaking changes merged to `master` branch on `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
\* Nov 29 2019: Initial draft of height specific consensus rule changes PR published to `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
\* Dec 05 2019: PR for height specific consensus rule changes merged to `master` branch on `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
\* Dec 06 2019: `V3.0.0-beta1` tagged and released. Release announcement posted on forum.
\* Dec 22 2019: Grin `testnet` aka `floonet` successful hardfork incorporating "height specific consensus rule changes" fixing the vulnerability. Grin begins to commit to the UTXO set in each block header from height `290080` on `floonet`.
\* Jan 03 2020: `V3.0.0` tagged and released. Release announcement posted on forum.
\* Jan 16 2020: At block height 524,160, the network successfully upgraded to v3.0.0, introducing consensus rules that fix the vulnerability.
\* Jan 20 2020: Disclosure of vulnerability through the publication of this document.

Transaction outputs in Mimblewimble are represented as Pedersen Commitments -
C = vH + rG
Here v is the amount, r is the blinding factor, and G and H are two generator points on the elliptic curve.
Note that Pedersen Commitments are additively homomorphic. The sum of two commitments is equal to the commitment of the sum of the values, blinded by the sum of the blinding factors.
C1 + C2 \
= (v1H + r1G) + (v2H + r2G) \
= (v1 + v2)H + (r1 + r2)G
Pedersen Commitments are a core primitive in Mimblewimble, keeping the transaction amounts confidential while allowing transaction outputs to be summed, verifying the integrity of the overall system. Each transaction can be shown to preserve value (nothing destroyed, nothing created) and the same can be shown across a block and across the full chain. Each transaction has an associated transaction kernel that consists of an excess value, itself a Pedersen Commitment and a Schnorr signature showing the excess is a commitment to a zero value.
Given the additively homomorphic property of the commitment scheme it is possible to construct two sets of outputs that sum to the same value. A trivial example can be demonstrated by swapping the blinding factors on pair of outputs.
out1 = v1H + r1G \
out2 = v2H + r2G
out1' = v1H + r2G \
out2' = v2H + r1G
out1 + out2 = (v1H + r1G) + (v2H + r2G) = (v1 + v2)H + (r1 + r2)G \
out1' + out2' = (v1H + r2G) + (v2H + r1G) = (v1 + v2)H + (r2 + r1)G
(out1 + out2) = (out1' + out2')
Given a transaction that spends one of these pairs, we can swap the outputs being spent for the alternate pair leaving the rest of the transaction untouched. Two conflicting versions of the same transaction can be constructed that differ only in the set of outputs being spent. All other aspects of the transaction will be identical.
This idea can be extended to blocks. Two conflicting versions of the same block can be constructed that differ only in the exact set of outputs being spent. All other aspects of the block will be identical, including the block header. This implies the set of spent outputs can be replaced \_after\_ constructing the block header and associated proof of work. We have introduced \_malleability\_ in the block in a way that leaves the block header and associated proof of work unchanged.
Each Grin node maintains a set of global Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) structures, one each for the outputs, associated rangeproofs and transaction kernels. Each block header commits to the merkle root of each of these MMRs. On receiving a new block the contained outputs, rangeproofs and transaction kernels are appended to the existing MMRs and merkle roots verified against those committed to in the block header. Each MMR is append-only and effectively immutable. The implementation provides "rewind" functionality to support the handling of forked blocks via "truncate and append".
This raises an interesting question: If the output MMR is immutable how do we "spend" existing outputs and what data is affected when we do so? The concept of spent/unspent is handled outside the MMR itself with unspent outputs maintained in a lightweight bitmap, each bit mapping to an unspent leaf in the full output MMR. Historical spent outputs can be pruned and removed from the output leaving the root unchanged due to the immutable characteristics of the MMR structure.
Note the output MMR effectively tracks the full set of transaction outputs (TXO) while the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) are represented as a bitmap mapping to a strict subset of the prunable output (P)MMR. The PMMR is immutable and append-only (while still prunable) whereas the bitmap updates over time to reflect the current UTXO set. Historical data in the UTXO bitmap can change as old outputs are spent.
This allows outputs to be maintained as immutable data, minimizing the mutable data needed to track the UTXO set.
Each block has a constant reward of 60 grin. The sum of all unspent outputs must equal the total supply which is known at each block height. We verify this through the sum of the kernel excess values where each transaction kernel is of the form 0H + rG. This in turn is verified by the individual transaction kernel signatures, with rG used as the public key.
So the UTXO set is verified in aggregate as we verify the sum is correct w.r.t the sum of excess values of the transaction kernels. This verifies that no value is created or destroyed and that the supply is correct. No output can be added or removed from the UTXO set without affecting the kernel sum verification.
The critical point here is that while we cannot add or remove outputs, it is possible to swap one set of outputs for another set that sum to the same overall commitment. While this cannot affect the total UTXO sum, and value cannot be created or destroyed, it does introduce the possibility of malleability to the UTXO bitmap itself. Instead of spending one set of outputs another set are spent in their place.
The UTXO set is open to malleability which in turn opens up a possibility for malleability at the block level, while leaving the block header unchanged. Recall that each block header commits to the merkle root of the full TXO set, not the UTXO set.
This allows two conflicting versions of a block to be constructed, differing \_only\_ in the set of outputs being spent, both sharing the same identical block header.
By broadcasting one version of the block to one subset of nodes on the network and the conflicting version to another subset of nodes on the network is it possible to introduce the conditions necessary for a chain split. Once in this state the network can be forced to split by broadcasting a subsequent block containing a spend of one of the related outputs. This output will be seen as unspent and spendable by some nodes, while being seen as already spent by other nodes.
This situation is difficult to identify in advance and difficult to recover from. An arbitrarily long period of time may elapse between the introduction of the conflicting blocks setting up the necessary conditions for the chain split and the block containing the spent/unspent output that will actually force the split.
Note that during initial "fast sync" a node will not download all historical blocks. The "txhashset" chain state is downloaded from a single peer. This includes a copy of the UTXO bitmap. The conditions necessary for a chain split can be introduced here by providing a conflicting version of the UTXO bitmap directly without requiring the download of the corresponding full block. The end result is the same chain split vulnerability.
A simple example of a potential attack is as follows. Assume the following outputs exist in the current UTXO set -
A: v1H + r1G \
B: v2H + r2G \
A': v1H + r2G \
B': v2H + r1G
(A + B) = (A' + B')
You could then create a transaction with inputs A and B that the majority of the network accepts. However, if you send a modified version tx' with the same outputs, but with inputs A' and B' instead, anyone who accepts it can be forked off the main chain at a later time.
To cause the split, you can simply spend A' or B' on the majority chain, and when the victim sees that transaction, they will believe A' and B' are already spent, so will ban the peers and not accept the block. At this point, a network split has occurred.
If you can get a large mining pool and an exchange to fall victim to the attack, the pool will continue to mine on the minority chain allowing you to send A or B to the exchange and swap for bitcoin. Since the pool and exchange are following the minority chain, both will believe A and B are still unspent and the transaction will be seen as valid.
However, on the majority chain, A and B are already spent, so the attacker would actually be performing a double-spend, and when the exchange finally realizes and resyncs to join the majority chain, the transaction they were sent is no longer valid, and the coins no longer theirs.
\*\*The attack outlined above would be exceptionally difficult to pull off in practice.\*\* The mining pool would need sufficient graph rate to continue to successfully mine several blocks after becoming split from the rest of the network, and both the exchange and the mining pool would need to be split simultaneously. This would need to happen without them noticing that both graph rate had dropped significantly, and that their connected peers were suddenly restricted.
## Details of fix
Conceptually the fix is simple. Rather than committing to the set of all outputs in each block header we commit to the set of \_unspent\_ outputs. This approach provides additional advantages beyond fixing this vulnerability. It has been discussed before in the context of making the initial sync more robust and more flexible. With the UTXO set known it is possible to break the initial txhashset download into smaller chunks and validate each chunk individually without needing to wait for the full txhashset to be downloaded from a peer. This is currently a significant bottleneck in the latency of the initial sync process. The decision was made to roll the fix for this vulnerability into preparation work for proposed improvements to the initial fast sync process.
The specific implementation choices around exactly how this is handled in Grin is covered in detail in the [Enable Faster Sync](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0009-enable-faster-sync.md) RFC and the associated [PR](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/pull/29).
Briefly, the `output\_root` field in each block header now commits to the combined root of the existing output PMMR and the current state of the unspent bitmap. This allows the majority of the data to continue to be maintained in the immutable (yet prunable) output PMMR while also committing to the spent/unspent information maintained in the associated bitmap. The bitmap itself is "chunked" into 1024 bit chunks, with the chunks themselves appended to an MMR. This has several nice benefits including \_"locality"\_ (outputs spent together are often located close together, within the same chunk) and \_"freshness"\_ (recent outputs are spent more frequently than older outputs). So while the bitmap is mutable and the data changes over time, these changes tend to occur within a relatively small number of chunks, and mainly toward the right-hand side of the MMR structure where the peaks are smaller. Any update to the bitmap will affect the overall root but hashing operations are minimized given the behavior described above.
This was a consensus breaking change as it affected the semantics of an existing field committed to in the block header. The decision was made to deploy these changes as part of the scheduled hardfork (HF2) in January 2020. The new consensus rules went into effect at block height 524160. There is no evidence or indication that this vulnerability was ever exploited prior to the hardfork. All nodes post-hardfork are running v3.0.0+ and are not vulnerable.

## Summary

On Tuesday Oct 8, 2019 a question in the dev/crypto gitter channel led to a vulnerability in the consensus protocol being discovered by the Grin developers. [CVE-2020-6638](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6638) was reserved for this. The vulnerability was fixed in v3.0.0 as part of the required upgrade for the [scheduled hard fork on Jan 15, 2020](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-v3-0-0-hard-fork-upgrade-jan-2020/). This document provides details on the vulnerability, the fix, and what measures were taken to protect Grin users.

**No action required by users. Nodes and wallets that are running v3.0.0+ are not affected by this vulnerability.**

The vulnerability was discovered following a question on [Tuesday Oct 8, 2019](https://gitter.im/grin_community/crypto?at=5d9bcc6f5173c33ca187d6cf) in the dev/crypto gitter channel. A malicious node could introduce *block malleability* by crafting two otherwise identical versions of a valid block, differing only in the exact set of outputs being spent. This could have been used to force a chain split on the network, which in turn could have led to subsequent attacks on users being caught on the wrong side of the network split. **Such attacks would have been exceptionally difficult to pull off in practice. There has been no indication or evidence of this vulnerability ever having been exploited.**

## Background

### Third party disclosure

As per [Grin's security process document](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/SECURITY.md#bilateral-responsible-disclosure-agreements), the project does not currently have any established bilateral disclosure agreements. In line with our security policy, no disclosure has therefore been made to third parties prior to to this publication. We have however determined that a few projects were vulnerable and have contacted them immediately upon publication.

As the consensus rules of the network requires running software that includes a fix, no additional action is required by mining pools, wallet software providers, or exchanges.

### Timeline of events

* Oct 08 2019: Question relating to "UTXO vs. TXO MMRs" posted to `grin/crypto` gitter channel. Various private internal conversations discussing ramifications of this question took place, leading to an internal agreement that there is indeed a vulnerability. It's still unclear exactly how far-reaching or what precisely is impacted. Author of initial question contacted privately to request no further discussion takes place in public pending further investigation.
* Oct 10 2019: Rough plan for fix decided on. Decision made to fix "quietly" and target scheduled HF2 (Jan 2020).
* Oct 15 2019: Initial version of fix tested internally.
* Oct 29 2019: Initial draft of "enable faster sync" RFC submitted as a PR to the `mimblewimble/grin-rfcs` github repo.
* Nov 04 2019: Initial draft of PR for non-consensus breaking changes published to `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
* Nov 26 2019: PR for non-consensus breaking changes merged to `master` branch on `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
* Nov 29 2019: Initial draft of height specific consensus rule changes PR published to `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
* Dec 05 2019: PR for height specific consensus rule changes merged to `master` branch on `mimblewimble/grin` github repo.
* Dec 06 2019: `V3.0.0-beta1` tagged and released. Release announcement posted on forum.
* Dec 22 2019: Grin `testnet` aka `floonet` successful hardfork incorporating "height specific consensus rule changes" fixing the vulnerability. Grin begins to commit to the UTXO set in each block header from height `290080` on `floonet`.
* Jan 03 2020: `V3.0.0` tagged and released. Release announcement posted on forum.
* Jan 16 2020: At block height 524,160, the network successfully upgraded to v3.0.0, introducing consensus rules that fix the vulnerability.
* Jan 20 2020: Disclosure of vulnerability through the publication of this document.

## Technical details of CVE-2020-6638

Transaction outputs in Mimblewimble are represented as Pedersen Commitments -

C = vH + rG

Here v is the amount, r is the blinding factor, and G and H are two generator points on the elliptic curve.

Note that Pedersen Commitments are additively homomorphic. The sum of two commitments is equal to the commitment of the sum of the values, blinded by the sum of the blinding factors.

C1 + C2

= (v1H + r1G) + (v2H + r2G)

= (v1 + v2)H + (r1 + r2)G

Pedersen Commitments are a core primitive in Mimblewimble, keeping the transaction amounts confidential while allowing transaction outputs to be summed, verifying the integrity of the overall system. Each transaction can be shown to preserve value (nothing destroyed, nothing created) and the same can be shown across a block and across the full chain. Each transaction has an associated transaction kernel that consists of an excess value, itself a Pedersen Commitment and a Schnorr signature showing the excess is a commitment to a zero value.

Given the additively homomorphic property of the commitment scheme it is possible to construct two sets of outputs that sum to the same value. A trivial example can be demonstrated by swapping the blinding factors on pair of outputs.

out1 = v1H + r1G

out2 = v2H + r2G

out1' = v1H + r2G

out2' = v2H + r1G

out1 + out2 = (v1H + r1G) + (v2H + r2G) = (v1 + v2)H + (r1 + r2)G

out1' + out2' = (v1H + r2G) + (v2H + r1G) = (v1 + v2)H + (r2 + r1)G

(out1 + out2) = (out1' + out2')

Given a transaction that spends one of these pairs, we can swap the outputs being spent for the alternate pair leaving the rest of the transaction untouched. Two conflicting versions of the same transaction can be constructed that differ only in the set of outputs being spent. All other aspects of the transaction will be identical.

This idea can be extended to blocks. Two conflicting versions of the same block can be constructed that differ only in the exact set of outputs being spent.

We have introduced *malleability* in the block in a way that leaves the block header and associated proof of work unchanged.

Each Grin node maintains a set of global Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) structures, one each for the outputs, associated rangeproofs and transaction kernels. Each block header commits to the merkle root of each of these MMRs. On receiving a new block the contained outputs, rangeproofs and transaction kernels are appended to the existing MMRs and merkle roots verified against those committed to in the block header. Each MMR is append-only and effectively immutable. The implementation provides "rewind" functionality to support the handling of forked blocks via "truncate and append".

This raises an interesting question: If the output MMR is immutable how do we "spend" existing outputs and what data is affected when we do so? The concept of spent/unspent is handled outside the MMR itself with unspent outputs maintained in a lightweight bitmap, each bit mapping to an unspent leaf in the full output MMR. Historical spent outputs can be pruned and removed from the output leaving the root unchanged due to the immutable characteristics of the MMR structure.

We verify this through the sum of the kernel excess values where each transaction kernel is of the form 0H + rG.

Once in this state the network can be forced to split by broadcasting a subsequent block containing a spend of one of the related outputs. This output will be seen as unspent and spendable by some nodes, while being seen as already spent by other nodes.

A: v1H + r1G

B: v2H + r2G

A': v1H + r2G

B': v2H + r1G

(A + B) = (A' + B')

You could then create a transaction with inputs A and B that the majority of the network accepts. However, if you send a modified version tx' with the same outputs, but with inputs A' and B' instead, anyone who accepts it can be forked off the main chain at a later time.

To cause the split, you can simply spend A' or B' on the majority chain, and when the victim sees that transaction, they will believe A' and B' are already spent, so will ban the peers and not accept the block. At this point, a network split has occurred.

If you can get a large mining pool and an exchange to fall victim to the attack, the pool will continue to mine on the minority chain allowing you to send A or B to the exchange and swap for bitcoin. Since the pool and exchange are following the minority chain, both will believe A and B are still unspent and the transaction will be seen as valid.

However, on the majority chain, A and B are already spent, so the attacker would actually be performing a double-spend, and when the exchange finally realizes and resyncs to join the majority chain, the transaction they were sent is no longer valid, and the coins no longer theirs.

**The attack outlined above would be exceptionally difficult to pull off in practice.** The mining pool would need sufficient graph rate to continue to successfully mine several blocks after becoming split from the rest of the network, and both the exchange and the mining pool would need to be split simultaneously. This would need to happen without them noticing that both graph rate had dropped significantly, and that their connected peers were suddenly restricted.

## Details of fix

Conceptually the fix is simple. Rather than committing to the set of all outputs in each block header we commit to the set of *unspent* outputs. This approach provides additional advantages beyond fixing this vulnerability. It has been discussed before in the context of making the initial sync more robust and more flexible. With the UTXO set known it is possible to break the initial txhashset download into smaller chunks and validate each chunk individually without needing to wait for the full txhashset to be downloaded from a peer. This is currently a significant bottleneck in the latency of the initial sync process. The decision was made to roll the fix for this vulnerability into preparation work for proposed improvements to the initial fast sync process.

The specific implementation choices around exactly how this is handled in Grin is covered in detail in the [Enable Faster Sync](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0009-enable-faster-sync.md) RFC and the associated [PR](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/pull/29).

Briefly, the `output_root` field in each block header now commits to the combined root of the existing output PMMR and the current state of the unspent bitmap. This allows the majority of the data to continue to be maintained in the immutable (yet prunable) output PMMR while also committing to the spent/unspent information maintained in the associated bitmap. The bitmap itself is "chunked" into 1024 bit chunks, with the chunks themselves appended to an MMR. This has several nice benefits including *"locality"* (outputs spent together are often located close together, within the same chunk) and *"freshness"* (recent outputs are spent more frequently than older outputs). So while the bitmap is mutable and the data changes over time, these changes tend to occur within a relatively small number of chunks, and mainly toward the right-hand side of the MMR structure where the peaks are smaller. Any update to the bitmap will affect the overall root but hashing operations are minimized given the behavior described above.

This was a consensus breaking change as it affected the semantics of an existing field committed to in the block header. The decision was made to deploy these changes as part of the scheduled hardfork (HF2) in January 2020. The new consensus rules went into effect at block height 524160. There is no evidence or indication that this vulnerability was ever exploited prior to the hardfork. All nodes post-hardfork are running v3.0.0+ and are not vulnerable.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
