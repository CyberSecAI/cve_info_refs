The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6065.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow in the calculation of buffer size within the `bmp_parsing` function. Specifically, the `total_width` is computed by multiplying the `width` by 4 without an overflow check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer Overflow (CWE-190) leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting the out-of-bounds write.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted, malicious BMP file to a victim. The malformed BMP causes the vulnerable code to perform an out-of-bounds write, triggering the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed BMP file to the vulnerable software (Accusoft ImageGear version 19.5.0) for processing. No other specific capabilities or position are mentioned.
