Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the V8 JavaScript engine, when running in "jitless" mode, processes regular expressions within PDFium. Specifically, a large regular expression with a specific number of "+" or "?" characters leads to an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `registers` array in `v8::internal::IrregexpInterpreter::RawMatch`. This occurs because the index used to access the array exceeds the array's bounds.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds read is a form of memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability can potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution within the browser context.
*   **Info Leak:** The out-of-bounds read could potentially be used to leak information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Document:** The vulnerability is triggered by embedding malicious JavaScript code within a PDF document.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious PDF document in a vulnerable application (such as Chrome or a program using PDFium) for the exploit to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create or modify PDF documents:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted PDF containing the malicious javascript payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the victim into opening the malicious PDF.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the V8 engine is in "jitless" mode, which PDFium utilizes for security reasons.
*   The `registers` array, which is accessed out-of-bounds, is a statically sized vector of 128 integers.
*   The number of "+" or "?" characters in the regular expression dictates the offset used to access the `registers` array. By controlling the number of these characters, the attacker can control the out-of-bounds read location.
*   The crashing instruction is located at `v8/src/regexp/regexp-interpreter.cc:406`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos.
*   The vulnerability is present in Google Chrome 80.0.3987.158.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in subsequent versions of Chrome.
*   The TALOS report provides more detail than the CVE description.
