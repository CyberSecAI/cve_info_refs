Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-6584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a privilege escalation issue. A user with limited access can store a "query" that affects all users, allowing for unauthorized access to other users' data. This is tied to insufficient access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** Users with limited privileges can modify or create queries that are visible and usable by all users, including administrators.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to save queries for all users from a low-privilege account effectively escalates the user's privileges.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The description also mentions a XSS vulnerability, but that is related to CVE-2020-6586

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking/Data Theft:** An attacker can steal the `csrf_ls` and `PHPSESSID` cookies of an administrator. With these stolen credentials, an attacker can perform administrative actions as if they were the administrator.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can perform any actions available to the administrator, potentially leading to data manipulation, service disruption, or further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Query Storage:** An attacker with limited access crafts and stores a malicious query accessible to all users.
- **Stolen Credentials:** The attacker leverages stolen `csrf_ls` and `PHPSESSID` cookies, which can be obtained with the malicious query storage.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Nagios Log Server to execute the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Limited User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with limited privileges on the Nagios Log Server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Nagios Log Server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker would need to be aware of the vulnerability in order to craft a malicious query to store.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content suggests that this vulnerability was addressed in a later version.
- The vulnerability is specific to Nagios Log Server version 2.1.3.
- CVE-2020-6584 is associated with other vulnerabilities including CVE-2020-6585 and CVE-2020-6586 which may be related.
