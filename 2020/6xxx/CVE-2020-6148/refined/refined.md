The provided content is a Talos vulnerability report that includes details for CVE-2020-6148.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow within the Pixar OpenUSD library when parsing compressed sections in binary USD files. Specifically, the `FIELDSETS` section decompression logic is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code reads a 64-bit value (`numFieldSets`) to determine the size of a buffer to allocate.
- It then reads another 64-bit value (`fsetsSize`) which is used to read data from the file.
- The size of the allocated buffer is based on `numFieldSets`, while the size of the data read is based on `fsetsSize`.
- No check is performed to ensure that `fsetsSize` bytes can fit into the allocated buffer.
- The attacker can control both `numFieldSets` and `fsetsSize`, leading to a heap buffer overflow if `fsetsSize` is larger than the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A specially crafted malformed file can trigger a heap overflow.
- This can lead to remote code execution.
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by controlling the size of allocated memory buffer, the size of the overflow, and the data of the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a malformed USD file provided by the attacker.
- The victim needs to open or process this attacker-provided file.
- On macOS, these files can be automatically rendered to generate thumbnails or opened by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted malicious USD file.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file.
