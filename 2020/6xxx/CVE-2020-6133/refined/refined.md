The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6133.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `CourseMoreInfo.php` page, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database.
- Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker might gain control of the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `CourseMoreInfo.php` page with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
- The attacker needs to make an authenticated request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
