Does your Bluetooth chip's RNG produce random numbers? Maybe. Sometimes. It's random.

Does your Bluetooth chip's RNG produce random numbers? Maybe. Sometimes. It's random.

The 90 day deadline for CVE-2020-6616 exactly passes during this Easterhegg \o/

According to the Bluetooth specification, the chip is required to contain a proper RNG. This RNG is used for key generation within the chip, but also exposed to the operating system. This is a great feature for embedded devices, which otherwise might not have access to a good RNG.

When analyzing the source code of Broadcom's RNG, we found that it accesses a Hardware Random Number Generator (HRNG) but has a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) fallback.

The HRNG looked good at least at first sight, and since it is a black box coming out of some memory mapped hardware registers, it is hard to analyze. It is missing some properties like a warm-up, which means reading out a couple of values during initialization before using it. However, the hardware might also do this internally.

Way more interesting is the PRNG, analyzed by @matedealer. The PRNG takes a couple of values which are not random at all. The most random value is the chip's clock. In most contexts within the code that require randomness, the PRNG is called multiple times in a row, thus, the clock is basically constant except from the initial value. Similar issues apply to the other registers and values the PRNG takes as input. The PRNG code was changed multiple times over the years of firmware dumps that we have, such as an additional caching behavior, different input values, etc.—and dropped in the most recent version.

On one development board, we found that the RNG function might run into the PRNG when calling it multiple times in a row. However, this seems to be an issue within the RNG cache of that specific development board.

When reporting this issue to Broadcom with CVE-2020-6616 already assigned by MITRE, they claimed all their chips had a HRNG and there was no reason ever to use the PRNG. That code was just there but would never be used. However, this is not true, and at least one comparably recent chip of a popular smartphone released in 2017 is missing a HRNG. Ooops :)

So we might have something like the KNOB attack here with slightly less entropy reduction but present in the hardware…

## HRNG and PRNG Details (CVE-2020-6616)

This is a joint work of @naehrdine, @matedealer, and @fxrh.

We collected at least 1GB of data from the following devices and all of them passed the
*Dieharder* tests.

| Chip | Device | Samples | Dieharder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BCM4335C0 | Google Nexus 5 | 2.7GB | Passed |
| BCM43430A1 | Raspberry Pi 3/Zero W | 1.3GB | Passed |
| BCM4345B0 | iPhone 6 | 1.8GB | Passed |
| BCM4355C0 | iPhone 7 | 1.0GB | Passed |
| BCM4345C0 | Raspberry Pi 3+/4 | 1.4GB | Passed |
| BCM4358A3 | Samsung Galaxy S6, Nexus 6P | 2.1GB | Passed |
| CYW20719B1 | Evaluation board | 1.4GB | Passed |
| CYW20735B1 | Evaluation board | 1.6GB | Passed |
| CYW20819A1 | Evaluation board | 1.2GB | Passed |

The chip in the *iMac Late 2009* is very slow and memory-limited, thus, we only
checked if the HRNG is present. The same is the case for the *Samsung Galaxy S10*
and *S20* chip, as it has a few more security features that make runtime analysis
harder. On the *iPhone 11*, we currently only have `BlueTool` support, which also
limits our analysis capabilities.
We assume that the presence of a HRNG is sufficient, because all devices on that
we were able to perform measurements had good results.

| Chip | Device | HRNG present |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BCM2046A2 | iMac Late 2009 | Yes |
| BCM20703A1 | MacBook Pro early 2015 | Yes |
| BCM4375B1 | Samsung Galaxy S10/S20 | Yes |
| BCM4347B1 | iPhone 8/X/XR | Yes |
| BCM4378B1 | iPhone 11 | Yes |

We found that the firmware of the *Samsung Galaxy S8* does not even reference the HRNG.
Also, we were not able to access the HRNG using known register locations. Each time we
triggered a RNG-related action such as pairing, a breakpoint we set within the PRNG
function was triggered. Since this issue
was already visible inside the firmware without performing measurements on the hardware itself,
we checked all firmware dumps we had. Overall, we identified five different implementation
variants. Those that are not included in the lists above might still have HRNG issues, but
it is way more unlikely. However, *Broadcom* and *Cypress* produced even more chips than
listed here, and they might be missing a HRNG similar to the *Samsung Galaxy S8*.

| Chip | Device | Build Date | RNG Variant | HRNG Location | PRNG | Cache |

=== Content from github.com_95344479_20250119_141139.html ===
HRNG and PRNG Details (CVE-2020-6616)
-------------------------------------
This is a joint work of @naehrdine, @matedealer, and @fxrh.
We collected at least 1GB of data from the following devices and all of them passed the
\*Dieharder\* tests.
Chip | Device | Samples | Dieharder
-----------| ----------------- | ---------- | -----------
BCM4335C0 | Google Nexus 5 | 2.7GB | Passed
BCM43430A1 | Raspberry Pi 3/Zero W | 1.3GB | Passed
BCM4345B0 | iPhone 6 | 1.8GB | Passed
BCM4355C0 | iPhone 7 | 1.0GB | Passed
BCM4345C0 | Raspberry Pi 3+/4 | 1.4GB | Passed
BCM4358A3 | Samsung Galaxy S6, Nexus 6P | 2.1GB | Passed
CYW20719B1 | Evaluation board | 1.4GB | Passed
CYW20735B1 | Evaluation board | 1.6GB | Passed
CYW20819A1 | Evaluation board | 1.2GB | Passed
The chip in the \*iMac Late 2009\* is very slow and memory-limited, thus, we only
checked if the HRNG is present. The same is the case for the \*Samsung Galaxy S10\*
and \*S20\* chip, as it has a few more security features that make runtime analysis
harder. On the \*iPhone 11\*, we currently only have `BlueTool` support, which also
limits our analysis capabilities.
We assume that the presence of a HRNG is sufficient, because all devices on that
we were able to perform measurements had good results.
Chip | Device | HRNG present
-----------| ----------------- | -----------
BCM2046A2 | iMac Late 2009 | Yes
BCM20703A1 | MacBook Pro early 2015 | Yes
BCM4375B1 | Samsung Galaxy S10/S20 | Yes
BCM4347B1 | iPhone 8/X/XR | Yes
BCM4378B1 | iPhone 11 | Yes
We found that the firmware of the \*Samsung Galaxy S8\* does not even reference the HRNG.
Also, we were not able to access the HRNG using known register locations. Each time we
triggered a RNG-related action such as pairing, a breakpoint we set within the PRNG
function was triggered. Since this issue
was already visible inside the firmware without performing measurements on the hardware itself,
we checked all firmware dumps we had. Overall, we identified five different implementation
variants. Those that are not included in the lists above might still have HRNG issues, but
it is way more unlikely. However, \*Broadcom\* and \*Cypress\* produced even more chips than
listed here, and they might be missing a HRNG similar to the \*Samsung Galaxy S8\*.
Chip | Device | Build Date | RNG Variant | HRNG Location | PRNG | Cache
----------|-----------------|------------|-------------|---------------|------|------
BCM2046A2 | iMac Late 2009 | 2007 | 1 | 0xE9A00, 3 regs | Minimal (inline) | No
