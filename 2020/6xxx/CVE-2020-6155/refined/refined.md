The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6155.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in Pixar OpenUSD when parsing compressed value representation arrays in binary USD files. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code handles sizes when reading compressed integer or floating point arrays, and in the subsequent decompression of those arrays.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). The code reads a size value from the file and allocates a buffer based on it. Subsequently, a different size value is read and used in a read operation. If the latter size value exceeds the former, a heap buffer overflow occurs during the read operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. Since the attacker controls both the allocated memory buffer size, the size of the overflow, and the overflow data, this can result in full control of the system if the vulnerability is successfully exploited.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a specially crafted, malformed USD binary file. The victim needs to access this file for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed USD file to the victim. No specific user privileges are required for the attack beyond being able to open the crafted file with vulnerable software.
