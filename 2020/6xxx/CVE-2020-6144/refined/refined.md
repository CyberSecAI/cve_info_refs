The provided content relates to CVE-2020-6144.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the username variable within the `install/Step5.php` file during the installation process of OS4Ed openSIS 7.4. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into the `Data.php` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper neutralization of directives in statically saved code (CWE-96): The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when constructing the `Data.php` file. Specifically, the username variable is directly included in the string written to `Data.php` without proper escaping or validation.
- Static Code Injection: By injecting malicious PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands when the `Data.php` is accessed

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The injected PHP code in the `Data.php` file will be executed when the application is accessed. In the provided example, the `phpinfo()` function is injected, which can provide system information.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request during the initial installation process to overwrite the database configuration in the Data.php file. This can be achieved by setting up a malicious MySQL server configured with the `skip-grant-tables` option and then inputting malicious PHP code into the username field during the installation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable openSIS instance prior to its initial installation or, if the installation directory is not removed, at a later time.
- The attacker requires the ability to set up a MySQL instance with the `skip-grant-tables` option.
- No authentication is required as the install directory is accessible without authentication.
