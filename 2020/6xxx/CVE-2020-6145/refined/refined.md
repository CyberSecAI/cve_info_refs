- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `field` parameter in the `frappe.desk.reportview.get` handler is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, or other database manipulation. The impact is rated as having low confidentiality and integrity impact but no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the HTTP request. The attacker requires knowledge of the application's API and how to craft the specific requests including the vulnerable parameters.
