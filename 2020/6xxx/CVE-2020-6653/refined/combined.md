Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-6653

CVSS v3 Base Score 3.8 AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

CWE-200: Information Exposure

CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files

The logcat file in versions 1.7.3 & prior of the mobile application can expose user
information by providing to access to a user’s credentials when a user registers for an account on
the mobile app. A malicious app or an unauthorized user with physical access to the device may be
able to obtain these credentials and later use them to control the user account. Eaton is not aware of
any successful exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.

Affected Product(s) and Version(s)

•  Eaton’s Secure Connect Android Mobile app – v1.7.3 & prior

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

Eaton has patched the security issue in the mobile app and released a new version 1.7.4 on android
play store. Users are recommended to update the mobile app to late st version.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
