**CVE Description:**
The vulnerability allows Web Extensions with the `all-urls` permission to access local files when making a fetch request with the mode set to 'same-origin'.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that when a web extension with the `all-urls` permission makes a fetch request with mode set to `same-origin`, it bypasses the checks that normally prevent access to file URLs. The `same-origin` mode incorrectly treated `file://` URLs as being same-origin with the extension's context. This allowed the extension to access local files, which is usually restricted by the browser's security model.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: Extensions with the `all-urls` permission could bypass same-origin restrictions when fetching local files with  `{mode:'same-origin'}`.
- Inconsistent handling of `file://` URLs. The `fetch` API treated `file://` urls differently based on the `mode` parameter, where the default caused a CORS request which fails for file URLs, while `mode:'same-origin'` allowed the request and bypassed security.
- Lack of user awareness: The `all-urls` permission doesn't explicitly inform users about the ability of an extension to access local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized file access: A malicious extension with `all-urls` permission could read arbitrary local files on the user's system. This could lead to data exfiltration, exposure of sensitive information, or other malicious activities.
- Bypassing the sandbox. The extension process is not sandboxed, so `file://` access allows arbitrary access to the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Web Extension: An attacker could create or compromise a web extension and include the vulnerable code.
- `fetch` API abuse: By using the fetch API with the `mode: 'same-origin'` option when the extension has the `all-urls` permission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and publish a web extension or inject malicious code into an existing extension.
- The extension must have the `all-urls` permission in the manifest file.

**Additional details from the bug report:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported in a Stack Overflow answer from 2017-05-13.
- The issue was present in Firefox on Linux and Windows, but was blocked by the sandbox on macOS due to the way the sandbox handles file access.
- Several popular add-ons were found to use this functionality, including Tampermonkey, Stylus, S3 Download Statusbar, EXIF Viewer, FoxReplace, and Surfingkeys.
- A fix was implemented in Firefox 74 to prevent extensions from using `fetch` with `mode: 'same-origin'` to access `file://` URLs by default.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by blocking access to local files via the `fetch` API for extensions with `all-urls` permissions in Firefox 74.
