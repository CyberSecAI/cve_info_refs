## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/62.0.3202.89 Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
Try the code from this stack overflow answer at a webextension:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108782/firefox-webextensions-get-local-files-content-by-path/44516256#44516256>
And you'll see that it is possible to read local files without user interaction.
More information:
As far as I know this is at the moment used by Stylus and a beta version of Tampermonkey (my extension). At Tampermonkey it's necessary that the user \_explicitly\_ enables file access, just like it's necessary at Chrome, in order to use it.
However, since the stack overflow answer was posted on 2017-05-13, I guess there are some more extensions that use it. That's why and since AMO currently is using a faster/automatic review I'm a little bit concerned that other extension might use it in a non-good-natured way, because the review process is unable to detect it (in opposition to Firefox's legacy API add-ons where the reviewers took account of this).
Finally, please think about implementing user-permitted file \_read\_ access. It's one of the most requested features of Tampermonkey.
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1246236](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246236 "NEW - Implement local filesystem read/write access.")
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1266960](/show_bug.cgi?id=1266960 "NEW - Extensions can not load file: URLs")
Actual results:
It's possible to read local files without any user interaction.
Expected results:
It should (not/only after user confirmation) be possible to access local files.

Looks like it can be anywhere in my testing of the function in Stylus.
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/>
To reproduce
1) install stylus
2) go to about:debugging
3) click debug and in the browser console type something like:
download('file:///etc/passwd').then(e => console.log(e));
Output:

This is a bug in fetch & web extension context, when the {mode:'same-origin'} flag is set. I wonder if it affects any other contexts.
MDN says: "same-origin — If a request is made to another origin with this mode set, the result is simply an error. You could use this to ensure that a request is always being made to your origin."
But somehow, moz-extension//{UUID} and file:// are considered same origin when you set this flag.
STR:
Run this script in the background context of any web extension.
var url = file:///SOME/LOCAL/FILE/PATH
fetch(url, {mode:'same-origin'}).then(f=>console.log("read file",f.url)).catch(e=> console.log('Error trying to read file'))
Expected:
Console: Error trying to read file
Actual
Console: read file file:///SOME/LOCAL/FILE/PATH

Why does this ONLY work when you set the 'same-origin' flag.
Also note that this request completely bypasses the sandbox.

Because our fetch support kind of sucks, and if you don't specify same-origin, it tries to treat it as a CORS request.

As far as I recall, extension processes don't have filesystem sandboxing yet, so as long as it doesn't work from content scripts, that's not too surprising.

I mean, that wfm, but then we need to be clearer about expectations here, and this doesn't really explain to me why the add-on has to (apparently?) jump through hoops to read files...

We should, but it's basically blocked on [bug 1246236](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246236 "NEW - Implement local filesystem read/write access."), and figuring out how we want to deal with filesystem access. I suppose we could add an exception, and ignore file: URL permissions for requests but still allow them for content scripts and such, but I'm not super happy about the idea...

They have to jump through hoops to make any cross-origin requests that don't support CORS. Like I said, our fetch() support kind of sucks.

Allowing the ability to read arbitrary files, by default is surprising and hard to justify from a security model perspective. Am I missing something here? Why does fetch() fail, and fetch({mode:'same-origin'}). I was taken completely by surprise about this, and I have been looking at web extensions for months. On one hand we say file:// is forbidden [1] but we do clearly state that match patterns will match on file:/// [2]
Regardless, default access to file:/// that bypasses the sandbox is risky and means extensions undermine the sandbox. At a minimum I think, we need to have users opt-in to extensions being allow to read file: URIs. Something like with a checkbox or menu option in about:addons. (Actually I thought there was a bug on file for that but I can't find it).

There's no default access to file: URLs. Extensions can access file: URLs if they have permissions for those URLs listed in their manifests, which works the same way for file: URLs as it does for other URLs.
For the third time: fetch() can only fetch those URLs in same-origin mode because our fetch() support sucks, and by default it tries to make a CORS request, which file: URLs don't support, rather than a same-origin request that leverages the extension permissions. Requests to http: URLs work the same way.

Right, but we don't tell the user that in the prompt that is shown for <all\_urls>.

Ok I didn't know that - I thought that all content processes had the same rules, except for the one for loading File:// uris.
I guess Jim can clarify there.
In any case, I think we need to \_something\_ here. My preference would be to deny file:// access by default, and allow the user to opt-in. Not sure how complex that is though, so maybe in the meantime, perhaps we should improve the permission prompt to at least advise the user that the extension can read your local files.

Changing the permission prompt is a bit of a rabbit hole with quite a few problems (how do you message people who installed this already, for example). I think we should deny this case, uplift it to 58 (if possible) and work with the ACE team to message affected add-ons.
Then we keep on the course of figuring out, with all the relevant teams, what use cases for file access to allow and how to do that in the future.

I think that's the crux of the problem. Not that extensions shouldn't be able to read files (if given permission it's a valid thing to do in some cases) but that many/most users will be thinking "Web" when they see that prompt and will not expect "rummage around on my disk" to be part of it. That is, do we need to add a "<file\_urls>" permission?Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

I think we should probably make the <all\_urls> permission not apply to files, and require extensions to explicitly specify file://\*/. And we should probably require that to be an optional permission.

The question of how we expose local files to be read is a question for a few groups (security, UX, product) and doing it on a security restricted bug is probably not the best way to get to a solution. There's some good stuff here but I think we should probably stick to the focus of shutting off local file access to fetch in this bug and moving the rest of the discussion to a public bug or forum.

So, both 'cors' and 'no-cors' mode reject because we end up calling DoCheckLoadURIChecks() here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/dom/security/nsContentSecurityManager.cpp#724>
This in turn ends up calling CheckLoadURIFlags() eventually which checks URI\_IS\_LOCAL\_FILE:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/caps/nsScriptSecurityManager.cpp#938>
This block ends up failing and the file URL is blocked as intended. Note, this is done \*before\* checking for URI\_LOADABLE\_BY\_ANYONE.
For 'same-origin' mode, though, we do not call DoCheckLoadURIChecks(). Instead we call DoSOPChecks() which basically calls NS\_HasBeenCrossOrigin():
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/dom/security/nsContentSecurityManager.cpp#711>
Which then ends up calling BasePrincipal::CheckMayLoad(). This happily accepts any URL if URI\_FETCHABLE\_BY\_ANYONE is set:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/caps/BasePrincipal.cpp#152>
As Kris mentioned, web extensions set this flag based on manifest data:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/110706c3c09d457dc70293b213d7bccb4f6f5643/netwerk/protocol/res/ExtensionProtocolHandler.cpp#382>
This seems like a policy or security check problem. I don't think trying to fix this in fetch() is the right place.

|  | |

To clarify what I think is at least one problem:
In the cross-origin security checks we explicitly check for and disallow file URLs. In same-origin security checks we don't do this because we assume they will be cross-origin and fail anyway. The flag breaks that assumption, though.

Other same-origin requests I see in the tree which would be able to touch local files:
\* worker scripts
\* HTMLTrackElement
\* Some FontFace loading code
\* nsManifestCheck
\* etc
These probably don't have the simple attack vector of fetch(), but I think we should fix them in a way that addressed them all if we can.

I am not actually following [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"). That "FETCHABLE\_BY\_ANYONE" flag would be on the \_uri\_, not the \_principal\_. Webextensions set that on \_webextension\_ URIs, which doesn't obviously have anything to do with attempts to load file:// URIs.
I have a slightly different question. Why is file:// special? Can extensions use this same mechanism to get at chrome:// URIs or whatnot?
Or put another way, should <all\_urls> basically mean "all URLs that are URI\_LOADABLE\_BY\_ANYONE", as opposed to "all URLs"? That will presumably restrict it to the things users expect....Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

No, keep it P1 - this is fundamental inconsistency in the security model. Either we need to fix this, or we need to make it clear that web extensions are allowed to read files from the file system. Web Extension bugs tend to get lower rating due to exploitation being predicated on installing a malicious extension - not a huge barrier, but more than if the issue was web exploitable. So while only being moderate in the scheme of firefox, I'd say this should be a P1 in the context of web extensions.

What's needed to move ahead with this proposal? I don't think the fix for [bug 1427448](/show_bug.cgi?id=1427448 "RESOLVED FIXED - Some web extension API's do not account for shorthand form of file:// url") will necessarily make much of a difference here. AIUI to fix this type of thing, we'd need to:
1) add a new permission for <file\_urls>
2) require it to be optional
3) in CAPS, when the triggering/subject principal is an add-on and the target URI chain has the local file flag, check if the add-on has the relevant permission

No. <all\_urls> should still match file URLs, and so should file://\*
What we need is a separate setting that allows users to opt into giving an extension access to local files, similar to what Chrome does. I don't particularly care when/where we prompt users to opt into this, but the status of that permission should at least be displayed on the add-on's about:addons detail page, and be togglable there.Flags: needinfo?(kmaglione+bmo)

Which means adding a new boolean flag to WebExtensionPolicy[1] and checking it in MatchPattern[2]. Which probably means adding an optional policy property to MatchPattern instances.

We just spoke about this at all hands, and as asked Im adding my strong support for the approach suggested by Kris above (i.e. a toggle where users can OPT IN to allowing extensions to have file access, and prevent access in the regular case).

With a side note that, in addition to preventing direct loading of file:// uris, we also need to prevent extensions open in tabs with file:// URIs (and then injecting a content script into it). From a discussion here it sounds like we don't want to still allow extensions even without the "file access" granted to inject content scripts into tabs with File:// uris that the USER opened. (im not super pumped about that, but it sounds also you shouldn't have to grant a random extension access to your file system, just so that it can inject some content script into the one specific document you opened from the file system.

Does "this" mean to prevent content script file:// access by default \_AND\_ to implement "a toggle where users can OPT IN to allowing extensions to have file access"?
I'm asking because the first "fix" will break Tampermonkey's ability to install scripts from local file URIs unless content scripts that are defined at the manifest are exempted from this change.

Do we want this as a new "public" permission, or just an internal flag that extension can never request, and can only be manually toggled though the UI?
And what should we do with already installed extensions in either case?

I don't understand this the way it's worded. And it seems all of the discussion in this bug is about direct access to reading local files, content scripts are a separate issue, and can be a separate bug.

Sorry, my comment is barely readable. I meant that we should have a holistic approach to restricting file system access. If we close this fetch hole, but still allow extensions to open and interact with tabs which have a file:// url open, then extensions will still have read access to the file system (since file: uris are treated as same-origin as files in the same directory). But you are right, that perhaps should be a separate bug.

I'm confused by this bug; the docs describe a function to check this capability: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/extension/isAllowedFileSchemeAccess> and describe "the user-controlled 'Allow access to File URLs' checkbox" (on <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/extension#getURL()> )

Are the docs incorrect or has much of what has been discussed in this bug been implemented?

So the `fetch('file:///etc/passwd')` call happens in a content process. The triggering principal (and loading principal) for the fetch is a ContentPrincipal with the URI `"moz-extension://01cf4af3-f9f4-4f63-8222-1f2c1db5bffb/_generated_background_page.html"`.

We end up in `ContentPrincipal::MayLoadInternal` and the `AddonAllowsLoad` call there returns true, because the `WebExtensionPolicy::CanAccessURI` call returns true. Given the manifest claims `"file:///*"` in the permissions this doesn't seem surprising, right? Anyway, that means `BasePrincipal::CheckMayLoad` returns true, and that's our general "Should this principal be considered same-origin with this URI?" method. So we consider this a same-origin load (e.g. `NS_HasBeenCrossOrigin` returns false, so `DoSOPChecks` returns success, so `nsContentSecurityManager::CheckChannel` returns success, so the load is allowed.

After things things Just Work: the fetch successfully opens the `FileChannelChild` channel, that remotes the actual filesystem access to the parent process (which is why sandboxing is nor relevant), etc.

Is there some expectation that given our current code this should *not* work?

`fetch('file:///etc/passwd');` does not load the resource (and neither does `XMLHttpRequest`) - this is desired as explained below.

`fetch('file:///etc/passwd', {mode:'same-origin'});` does load the resource.

They should behave consistently.

`file:///*` is automatically granted when the `<all_urls>` permission is requested, which is very common.

Most of the extensions that request `<all_urls>` don't really need file access.

I'd like to block file access by default unless a user explicitly consented, to protect the general population whose add-ons don't need to access files.

(FWIW, in Chrome `<all_urls>` also includes `file:///*`, but access is withheld until the user manually grants access at the extension management page.)

Next week (or maybe the week after, at the start of release cycle of 73), I intend to land a patch that closes this hole.

The hole does already not work on macOS ([comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c49 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files")), and starting with my patch, it won't work either on Linux, Windows and Android.

Content scripts are allowed to run on file:-URLs, but other forms of

file access from extensions are not allowed. This has been the behavior

for a while, but there were no tests. This commit adds tests to ensure

that the functionality continues to work as intended.

* [comment 61](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c61 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files") is a set of unit tests that already pass, independently of the bugfix. These tests were added to make sure that content scripts for files do not regress.
* [comment 61](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c61 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files") is a regression test for this bug, and should land in the future, when this bug becomes public.

The patch in [comment 60](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c60 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files") seems fine, but I want to understand answers to a few questions beforehand:

1. This proposed fix is different than the agreed consensus in most of this bug, up to and including your second-to-last [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c58 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), which was putting this access behind a special permission prompt/checkbox. Why did you change your approach? Given recent urgency in [bug 1598946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598946 "ASSIGNED"), should we bundle the two bugs together, behind the same optional permission?
2. Why doesn't this work on MacOS? Is it a recent "regression", or some configuration/platform difference?
3. I'm looking up code related to [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), perhaps this cross-origin check should be lower in the chain to cover more than just addons usecase.

I implemented it like this because it fixes file:-access related bugs without breaking known supported cases.

We probably still want to support a prompt/checkbox, but that requires more efforts and review/feedback cycles. That fits better in [bug 1598946](/show_bug.cgi?id=1598946 "ASSIGNED") or a follow-up to that bug (and some of the ideas expressed here already align with the tentative plan).

> 2. Why doesn't this work on MacOS? Is it a recent "regression", or some configuration/platform difference?

The paths that we tested were blocked by the sandbox on macOS. If I choose a [whitelisted location](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/efdf9bb55789ea782ae3a431bda6be74a87b041e/security/sandbox/mac/SandboxPolicyContent.h#70), e.g. `file:///usr/share/` , then the load is still accepted.

> 3. I'm looking up code related to [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296#c23 "VERIFIED FIXED - Webextensions can access local files"), perhaps this cross-origin check should be lower in the chain to cover more than just addons usecase.

I'm not aware of any other generic file:-whitelisting other than extensions. Judged by extension permissions only, `file:`-access should have been allowed (and is so, according to `WebExtensionPolicy::CanAccessURI`). But we don't have a separate permission warning or any other obvious indication that an extension is allowed access to local files, so it was a nice "feature" that `file:`-URLs were somehow already blocked access (through `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest`) despite being allowed by `CanAccessURI`. The patch changes the implementation of `CanAccessURI` to match the current default behavior for cors-fetches, and does it at that place to cover most scenarios (without affecting content scripts, for which we want to continue supporting access). If we ever decide to open up file:-access (rather than restricting it), then we probably need to revisit the implementation, but until then, I'd rather be on the safe side.

I think that file:-access to extensions can be a useful feature in some cases, but it should by no means be the silent default behavior.

What's your advice on landing the patches?

I want to land two patches, the fix itself, and unit tests that verifies that the supported behaviors are still working as intended.

Do you think that it is fine to land the following at the same time:

* <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54541> (tests that already passed before the fix)
* <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54540> (fix itself)

(and the regression test in the future - <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D54543> ).

... or should I only land the fix now, and land the tests later?

One interesting point to consider is that the bug itself has been public for over two years by now:

I checked all public add-ons on AMO, and the following add-ons are relying on this bug / "feature". I've listed the number of users and the use cases:

* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/> 323k users
  + To import local files in scripts: <https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/issues/347>
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3download-statusbar/> 82k users (recommended badge)
  + To read files for checksum calculations and image preview.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/> 77k users (recommended badge)
  + To support installation of local user styles: <https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/pull/134>
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/exif-viewer/> 35k users
  + Used to view metadata of local files.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxreplace/> 7k users
  + Used to automatically update by reading from a local file.
* <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/surfingkeys_ff/> (version <= 0.9.41) 1k users
  + Used to read settings from a local file: <https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys/pull/891>
  + Author removed the code in the latest versions (including 0.9.57) when they discovered that the functionality does not work on macOS.
* and a couple of smaller ones.

The total number of users is about 500k. Since the functionality is already not working on macOS, and the loss of use cases is not extremely critical, I'll land the patch that disables local file access, next week.

Checked through loading the extension from about debugging and inspecting it on a fixed version and also installing it (after setting xpinstall.signatures.required to false) in about:addons on a Nightly build from before the push and then upgrading the browser.

A security error declaring that data may not be loaded from "file:///etc/passwd" is logged in the extension console log after the fix.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

(original test and steps from [bug 1228754](/show_bug.cgi?id=1228754 "VERIFIED FIXED - Show about:blank (placeholder \"Search or enter address\" in the URL bar) using javascript URI scheme (spoof)") and @qab, not from me)
1. Open attached file.
2. click link
3. click back button in the browser
Somehow, the URL stays in the URL bar. Interrogating the browser's currentURI shows the URL shown in the URL bar, but the document displayed is actually about:blank (and the documentURI and so on verify this, and document.documentElement.nodePrincipal is the original opener's principal (localhost if you host the file there, bugzilla if you opened it directly ).

Adding the bounty flag as requested by the reporter.
Lowering the severity to sec-moderate reflecting that
1) the user has to hit back on the error page (unusual suspicion-raising circumstances)
2) you can only spoof sites that don't actually have certs
#2 in particular means you can't spoof Facebook, Google, "my bank", etc. Spoofing is only useful if it can be used to fake a valuable target site for phishing, etc. attacks.Flags: sec-bounty?Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---) → [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

You can spoof pages that contain in invalid character. So, for example, you can spoof a page that looks like '<https://www.facebook.com>`' (note the invalid character), so its not just websites with no certs. In my opinion most users would not notice the invalid character at the end. Also I assume there is a special character that is less noticeable than '`' which could be used.

Samael, do you think you'd have time to help here? Just say no if you don't have, and I'll try to
find time.

One thing I'm noticing is that Chrome doens't put javascript: into session history. As an extremely simple test, I did:
location.href="javascript:'whatever'";
In chrome, the document does change, but URL bar, history.length and location.href remain the same. In firefox both URL bar and location.href changed to javascript:'whatever', and history length increases.
I don't see a clear reason to keep javascript: in session history, maybe we should change this behavior.
BTW I think that's also the reason I sometimes keep being redirected again when pressing back. Addons such as Wikiwand is using javascript: to redirect. I have impression that some websites also do.

Per spec, history.length should increase. Otherwise you get user dataloss: the user can't go back to the page that used to be there!
Also per spec the URL bar and location.href should become the URL of the document triggering the javascript: load or so. At some point we should really sit down and align this last bit with the spec... Pretty sure we have existing bugs tracking that.

I believe you're referring [bug 836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)"). I found the spec for document.URL stuff [1] and am still trying to better understand how spec describes session history behaviors.
It looks to me that the document.URL stuff is all we need for this bug. I'll see what I can do.

Hi Boris,
May I have your feedback and advices here? I'm trying to use the override URI as the URI for document, session history entry, and docshell's current URI, but I'm not quite confident about how it should be implemented. Does this look the right path to you?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

|  | |

If we want to take the "change the URI" approach, why wouldn't we just have the javascript: channel return the URI we want from GetURI, and presumably set the LOAD\_REPLACE flag so people ignore the originalURI?Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Or perhaps even more simply, change which URI we pass to the NS\_NewInputStreamChannel call in nsJSChannel::Init, if we know which URI we'll really want at that point.

In fact, I expect that the GetURI the nsJSChannel returns doesn't matter; what matters is the stream channel's URI.

Thanks Boris!
I will commit patches on [bug 836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)") since it's more reasonable to deal with the document.URL issue there, and revisit this bug afterward. I'm expecting I'll be able to just invalid this bug then.

No, don't do that! Fixing a bug elsewhere doesn't make a related bug INVALID. You could maybe use "worksforme" for an old bug that magically goes away, but if it's a security bug and you know what fixed it (as in this case, [bug 836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)") presumably) then you need to mark it FIXED.Depends on: [836567](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)")Flags: needinfo?(sawang)

Looks like the 'String.contains' function doesn't exist anymore. Make sure to replace
>"location.toString().contains('http')"
into
>"location.toString().startsWith('http')"

Sorry I wasn't actively working on this recently. Made some attempts these 2 days but according to [bug 836567 comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=836567#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - Set document.URL (location) to url of active document when navigation started for javascript:-generated documents per HTML5 (Nested javascript: iframe doesn't load, runs into nesting limit for frames with same URL)") I should be holding it for a moment.
