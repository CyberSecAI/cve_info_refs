Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2020-6787:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element. The application attempts to load DLLs from the same directory it is executed from, without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The Bosch Video Client installer is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. It loads DLLs from the same directory it is executed from, without verifying their integrity or source, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded instead.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the Bosch Video Client installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory where the installer is started from. The attacker could achieve this through social engineering or other means that convince the user to move the malicious dll into the same directory as the installer.
- The attacker needs no special privileges (PR:N) to perform this attack. User interaction is required (UI:R) to execute the installer.
