{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `CrashReporterMetadataShmem::ReadAppNotes` function where an array index (`key`) read from shared memory is used without proper validation. This lack of validation allows an attacker-controlled value to be used as an index into an `EnumeratedArray`, potentially writing data out-of-bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious content process can manipulate shared memory to cause an out-of-bounds write in the broker process. This memory corruption can be exploited to achieve code execution in the broker process, leading to a sandbox escape and local privilege escalation (LPE).",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Shared memory manipulation",
        "Triggering crash reporting"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have code execution within a sandboxed content process to modify the shared memory used for crash reporting. The attacker must then trigger a crash in the content process to invoke the vulnerable code in the broker process."
  },
  "additional_information": {
     "technical_details": "The `CrashReporterMetadataShmem::ReadAppNotes` function reads metadata, including annotations, from shared memory. The code uses an attacker-controlled key value as an index into an `EnumeratedArray` named `aNotes`. The `EnumeratedArray` and `Array` do not have bounds check in release builds, leading to the OOB write. The crash occurs in the broker process, which is not sandboxed, allowing for privilege escalation.",
     "poc_details": "The provided proof-of-concept (POC) involves a DLL that sets the `key` to `0xffffffff` for the first annotation and then crashes the content process. This causes the broker process to attempt to read the annotation using the attacker-controlled index, resulting in a stack out-of-bounds write.",
     "fix_details": "The fix involves adding a bounds check to ensure the index `key` is within the valid range of the `EnumeratedArray`, which in this case, is `Annotation::Count`. If the index is out of range the annotation is discarded.",
    "affected_versions": "Firefox versions prior to 73 and Firefox ESR versions prior to 68.5",
