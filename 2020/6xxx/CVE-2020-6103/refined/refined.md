## Vulnerability Report for CVE-2020-6103

This report describes a code execution vulnerability in the AMD Radeon DirectX 11 Driver (atidxx64.dll).

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write
*   **CWE:** CWE-787
*   **Affected Software:** AMD Radeon DirectX 11 Driver atidxx64.dll 26.20.15019.19000
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted pixel shader.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by modifying the `round_ni` (floating-point round to integral float) source operand (register out of range) in a pixel shader, which leads to memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Code execution. The attacker can influence the `RCX` (size) value for the `memset` operation by modifying the shader bytecode, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Exploitation:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered from a HYPER-V guest using the RemoteFX feature, leading to code execution on the HYPER-V host (inside the `rdvgw.exe` process).
    *   Theoretically, it could also be triggered from a web browser using WebGL and WebAssembly.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs due to a memory corruption issue in the AMD graphics drivers when processing a malformed pixel shader. The `round_ni` instruction with an out-of-range register can be manipulated to influence the size argument (`RCX`) of a `memset` operation, causing it to write beyond the intended buffer.

**Mitigation:**

The report does not contain specific mitigations but indicates a vendor disclosure date, implying the vulnerability was reported to AMD for patching.

**CVSSv3 Score:** 8.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
