{
  "CVE-2020-6571": {
    "Description": "Insufficient data validation in Omnibox in Google Chrome prior to 85.0.4183.83 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via IDN homographs via a crafted domain name.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient data validation in the Omnibox component of Google Chrome.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient data validation",
      "IDN homograph vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Domain spoofing, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
       "Crafted domain name"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to create and host a crafted domain name that exploits IDN homographs",
        "User interaction required to visit the malicious website"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from how Chrome handles Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs), allowing an attacker to create a domain that looks legitimate but actually points to a malicious site. This is a classic example of a homograph attack where characters from different alphabets are used to create a domain name that visually resembles a different, trusted domain."
