Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6790:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" within the Bosch Video Streaming Gateway installer. Specifically, the installer calls an executable without properly validating its location, making it susceptible to DLL or EXE hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The installer doesn't specify the full path to the executable it needs to launch, which causes it to look in the current directory first, and allows an attacker-controlled executable to be loaded from the same directory as the installer. This allows an attacker to provide their own malicious executable to be executed in place of the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to place a malicious executable with the same name as the expected executable in the same directory as the installer. This usually requires the victim to be tricked into running the installer from a directory containing the malicious executable.
- **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable installer from a directory where the malicious executable is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable in a location where the victim will later execute the installer from.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into running the installer from a directory that contains the malicious payload.
