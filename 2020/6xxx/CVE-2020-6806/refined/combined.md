Whilst browsing the web using Firefox Nightly (`ASAN` built from <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/be3a05f615a557fd4c5171f789cc460688d9c3b8>), the browser crashed. I had 38 tabs open, it's hard to say which one triggered this.

I believe <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/site-bleacher/> is to blame for this particular crash, but only when installed with uBlock Origin and/or uMatrix on a dirty profile. It should crash within 5 minutes of browsing around. Site Bleacher does its work after a tab is closed, so make sure to open and close some random tabs. Clean profiles don't seem to be affected much at all. Setting dom.storage.next\_gen to false completely fixes the problem.

Simplified STR:

Create new profile

Install Site Bleacher

Open a half dozen random tabs

close all but 1

Tap the Site Bleacher icon and select clean.

It seems we want to access an [`OriginInfo`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/quota/ActorsParent.cpp#3285) instance through a [raw pointer `mOriginInfo`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/quota/QuotaObject.h#70) which lives in a `QuotaObject` instance that outlives the `ClearRequest` that has cleared the last counting reference on this `OriginInfo`.

Note to me:

1. We probably want [this](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/diff/36d942c4bb79543a415900982953b5354bf53bdf/dom/quota/ActorsParent.cpp#541) back to catch similar issues in the future earlier. (Not in this bug of course)
2. Check `DirectoryLock` because I would expect `ClearRequestOp` should wait for a directory lock for an origin if there is a quota client holding a directory lock for that origin. (Or break/abort other matching directory locks held by quota clients)

I couldn't reproduce the issue by following the [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free (READ of size 8) in mozilla::dom::quota::QuotaObject::LockedMaybeUpdateSize"), but I found something in our code:

* Before `QuotaManager` clear an origin, [it asks its client to abort their operations](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3a0a8e2762821c6afc1d235b3eb3dde63ad3b01a/dom/quota/ActorsParent.cpp#6702)
* For the LS case, it asks all databases under the [requesting origin to close](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3a0a8e2762821c6afc1d235b3eb3dde63ad3b01a/dom/localstorage/ActorsParent.cpp#9222-9224).
  + If the IPC fails or there is a `mSnapshot` object, the database won't close.
  + If IPC ok, then the database will be closed after the content process sends AllowToClose back.

When `AbortOperations` is called, I expect all existing accesses (`Database`, `Snapshot`) to `DataStore` (since it holds `QuotaObject`) should be aborted.

I still need to look into the code around more since lifecycles for `Snapshot` and `Database` are not cleared enough to me, but there seems to have an issue around `AbortOperation` and `Snapshot`.

Actually, it's probably not related `AbortOperation` because it's used to ensure QM internal operations get the directory lock earlier.

Finally, I could reproduce the issue via opt-debug-asan build and it crashed at what I suspected in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free (READ of size 8) in mozilla::dom::quota::QuotaObject::LockedMaybeUpdateSize") (I suggested to change that debug assertion to release assertion for Nighly and early Beta).

Below is my stack:

> Oh, yeah. ClearRequestBase::DeleteFiles can't remove entire origin if the directory lock for it only covers specific client directory.

Yeah, I'm working on a patch to create an internal operation in QuotaManager. It will only remove the origin directory when it has a directory lock for the whole origin and the origin directory is still empty when it goes to the IO thread. Note that it will be canceled at the early stage if some other client holding a directory lock for that origin.

Well, maybe we should consider if it's worth doing at all, seems like a non trivial patch. Leaving an empty origin directory in the repository doesn't look like a big issue, especially at this point when we plan to completely change the layout on disk. Users won't be able to tell if a directory belongs to specific origin.

That's a good point! I was worried about having too many empty origin directories on the disk, but we can consider doing that in other bugs, especially it's a sec-high bug (we shouldn't make a nontrivial patch on sec bug).

I will prepare a small patch.

[Bug 1610880](/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free (READ of size 8) in mozilla::dom::quota::QuotaObject::LockedMaybeUpdateSize") - Do not remove the empty origin directory when clearing a client;

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: From the patch, attackers might suspect the issue is related to race between quota clients. However, it's still not easy to figure out how to do that.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: In theory 68, but invloved functions in STR is disabled by default in 73 or earler.
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: 1529122 (Main), 128679 (functions being called in the reported STR))
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: (Plan to uplift to esr 68, beta 74 after there is no any related issue reported for a week)
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It should be small since I have pushed to try and the try looks green. Also, I made a test to verify the fix works.

Please nominate this for Beta approval when you get a chance. It grafts cleanly as-landed. If you want to land this on ESR68 too, it'll need a rebased patch. Given that the functionality in question is disabled by default there, I'm not convinced it's worth the effort, though.

patchForEsr68.patch

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**:
* **User impact if declined**: Although STR needs LSNG (which is disable by default on 68) to be involved, it can happen on other storage clients (IDB, DOM Cache) in theory. The possibility should be much lower since they don't cache data in memory for a while and then flush into disk later.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 75, 74
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Risky should be low, but many codes in QuotaManager has been changed between 68 and 74 so I marked it as medium.

I ran all tests under QuotaManager and the attached test and all of them passed.

* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

I reproduced the initial crash by following the STR from [Comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - heap-use-after-free (READ of size 8) in mozilla::dom::quota::QuotaObject::LockedMaybeUpdateSize") - on Ubuntu 18.04 using the provided Firefox Nightly (ASAN build) from the Description.

I can confirm that the crash is no longer reproducible on Firefox Nightly 75.0a1 (20200221095110) and Firefox 74 beta 7.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6808: URL Spoofing via javascript: URL](#CVE-2020-6808)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document.

##### References

* [Bug 1247968](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247968)

#### [#CVE-2020-6809: Web Extensions with the all-urls permission could access local files](#CVE-2020-6809)

Reporter
Jan Biniok
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a Web Extension had the all-urls permission and made a fetch request with a mode set to 'same-origin', it was possible for the Web Extension to read local files.

##### References

* [Bug 1420296](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420296)

#### [#CVE-2020-6810: Focusing a popup while in fullscreen could have obscured the fullscreen notification](#CVE-2020-6810)

Reporter
Avi Drissman of the Chrome security team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

After a website had entered fullscreen mode, it could have used a previously opened popup to obscure the notification that indicates the browser is in fullscreen mode. Combined with spoofing the browser chrome, this could have led to confusing the user about the current origin of the page and credential theft or other attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1432856](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

##### References

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

* [Bug 1613765](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1613765)

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

##### References

* [Bug 1616661](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1616661)

#### [#CVE-2020-6813: @import statements in CSS could bypass the Content Security Policy nonce feature](#CVE-2020-6813)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
low
##### Description

When protecting CSS blocks with the nonce feature of Content Security Policy, the @import statement in the CSS block could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary styles, bypassing the intent of the Content Security Policy.

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 73 and Firefox ESR 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-4335-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

21 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

## Details

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60

and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these

passwords would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, obtain sensitive information,

or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-20503](/security/CVE-2019-20503), [CVE-2020-6798](/security/CVE-2020-6798), [CVE-2020-6800](/security/CVE-2020-6800),

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 68.6

Announced
March 10, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 68.6

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1614971](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1614971)

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

```

The ECMAScript specification requires the promise resolution algorithm to synchronously access the

`then` property of the resolution object. Therefore, when a user defines a corresponding accessor on

`Object.prototype`, a majority of calls to `ResolvePromise` become observable to user JavaScript

code.

`ReadableStreamCloseInternal` fails to take that into account. The function doesn't check whether

the length of the request container[2] remains unchanged after a call to `ResolvePromise`[5] and

uses the original length as the loop exit condition[3]. If an attacker shrinks the container from

inside the promise resolution, `getAs`[4] will access out-of-bounds data during the next iteration.

The code sets the stream's state to `closed`[1] before iterating through the requests, and most

methods that modify the container check that the stream is in the `readable` state first. However,

the `tee` algorithm employs its own set of flags to track the state of the child streams[7]. These

flags only get updated after the loop has ended[6], so `TeeReaderReadHandler` will pass all the

checks even when it's called from inside `ResolvePromise`.

The only remaining obstacle is that `TeeReaderReadHandler` is attached to a promise reaction and is

supposed to always run asynchronously. Therefore, the attacker has to figure out how to

synchronously trigger promise reactions. Roughly speaking, reactions get executed when the last

active `nsAutoMicroTask` object is destroyed. The main challenge here is to run JavaScript outside

the `nsAutoMicroTask` scope. Conventional means of running JS like event handlers, `setTimeout` and

<script> elements won't work as they always instantiate a new `nsAutoMicroTask`. Instead, the

attacker can reuse the `then` accessor technique and execute JavaScript, for example, during

resolution of a promise created by the Fetch API. The stack trace in this case looks as follows:

```
CallGetter
GetExistingProperty
NativeGetPropertyInline
js::NativeGetProperty
js::GetProperty
js::GetProperty
js::GetProperty
ResolvePromiseInternal
js::PromiseObject::resolve
ResolveOrRejectPromise
js::ReadableStreamFulfillReadOrReadIntoRequest
JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource
mozilla::dom::BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady
nsInputStreamReadyEvent::Run

```

All that's left then is to create and immediately destroy an `nsAutoMicroTask` object at the right

time, which is trivial.

I can approximately comprehend many of the words in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security: OOB access in js::ReadableStreamCloseInternal"), but my understanding of microtasks and exactly how they are specified to work is...not good enough to understand the details roughly once `nsAutoMicroTask` gets mentioned. I may need to drag in a DOM expert or so to make progress through this, and to figure out what the *right* way to address it is, exactly.

CCing suspects for investigation, since I barely understand the JS half of this and I emphatically do not understand the DOM or `nsAutoMicroTask` portion of this; will try to poke people to see if we can walk through this in-person in Berlin today, too.

So I managed to find Olli at lunch...then as I was eating nearby he disappeared and I lost track of him. Let's go to needinfo, at least til I can find him in person. I have an hour and a half til the next place I have to be, if something possibly can be fit in in that time...

I briefly described/discussed this with annevk as well a few minutes ago, and he was wondering if we were just flat-out missing an `nsAutoMicroTask` somewhere -- because it ought not be possible for the `ResolvePromise` to induce a synchronous resolution that way. This seems at least *possible* to me, based on my meager knowledge of promises and the DOM side of them, but I definitely don't have the knowledge to evaluate the claim and have any confidence in my evaluation.

So looking at this over IRL, we think there's definitely a missing `nsAutoMicroTask` in `mozilla::dom::BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady` or so -- a microtask missed because it wasn't recognized that the JSAPI function called there could cause script to run. :-|

Once that's set aside, tho, it seems like it ought be fragile to loop over indexes in the read requests array this way. But, it really shouldn't be -- that array shouldn't be being touched by any code other than this, when the stream is already marked as closed. It feels to me like we should 1) change the relevant steps of `ReadableStreamCloseInternal` so that we *extract* the requests array (implicitly clearing the stored array) before we process it (now as sole owner of it), which requires 2) figuring out who else is "simultaneously" accessing-and-mutating that array and making them stop. It *looks* like the simultaneous access is supposed to only be possible with a spec bug -- maybe? -- but I'm building a browser now to see if I'm misreading things (very possible). Once we do that, tho, there would not be a possibility of multiple places in code modifying this array at the same time, and it would then be safe and normal to loop element-by-element as we do now.

Running the testcase in a debug build will fail the assertion at the end of this snippet:

```
MOZ_MUST_USE bool js::ReadableStreamDefaultControllerEnqueue(
    JSContext* cx, Handle<ReadableStreamDefaultController*> unwrappedController,
    Handle<Value> chunk) {
  AssertSameCompartment(cx, chunk);

  // Step 1: Let stream be controller.[[controlledReadableStream]].
  Rooted<ReadableStream*> unwrappedStream(cx, unwrappedController->stream());

  // Step 2: Assert:
  //      ! ReadableStreamDefaultControllerCanCloseOrEnqueue(controller) is
  //      true.
  MOZ_ASSERT(!unwrappedController->closeRequested());
  MOZ_ASSERT(unwrappedStream->readable());

```

The ReadableStream tee code can call this function, on a controller for a stream that does not satisfy step 2 -- which associated spec prose indicates is a *precondition*. So possibly the ReadableStream tee code should be checking not just `!canceled1`, but also can-close-or-enqueue, before doing its thing. (This appears to be the only place that can touch this array -- so if we fix this, we can extract out the array and operate on it as a local, as suggested in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Security: OOB access in js::ReadableStreamCloseInternal").)

OK, so a few things:

1. Given that ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource can run script, `BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady` should absolutely have an `AutoEntryScript`, not an `AutoJSAPI`.
2. `AutoEntryScript` is spec-visible, in the sense that it can trigger promise reactions when it comes off the stack. Specs should generally have corresponding bits involving manipulating the script context stack and doing microtask checkpoints (e.g. see "prepare to run a script" or "prepare to run a callback" in the HTML spec, and their corresponding cleanup algorithms). Sounds like the streams spec needs to do something like that, if it's introducing script entry points....

So, missing `AutoEntryScript` is apparently really terrible. Could we at least make it not security-terrible, by making `JS::ResolvePromise` or whatever the underlying-est primitive is, check that we're always inside some sort of whatever-it-is-`AutoEntryScript` enacts (and probably crash if we aren't)? Doesn't solve the missing-an-entry problem and identifying all such places, but at least it means missing something isn't bad.

So I may be doing something terribly wrong somehow, but if I write that patch *without* the explicit `nsAutoMicroTask mt;`, `AutoEntryScript` does not actually seem to defer microtask resolution, and the assertion/crash are still possible. For comparison, script execution has in sequence an `nsAutoMicroTask mt;` followed by an `AutoEntryScript`:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/script/ScriptLoader.cpp#2710>

If I really shouldn't need the `nsAutoMicroTask mt;` there, it seems like something else would need changing for that. Right?

(I'm approximately science-dogging away here, so if it looks like I have no idea what I'm doing there's a good reason for that...)

Another possibility, besides (in addition to?) crashing in resolve/reject-promise internals if there's no microtask queue pending, would be to check/assert/crash in `nsAutoMicroTask` if there are any pending promise jobs to reject/resolve when the constructor call happens (and the constructor call isn't a nested `nsAutoMicroTask`).

The underlying-est primitives are whatever can run script.

We have basically two options, not necessarily mutually exclusive. One is to do check-and-crash at the actual script entry points. So for example in `js::InternalCallOrConstruct` or some such, if we push things down as much as we can to make sure we're definitely catching all the cases that would definitely enter script. This has the benefit of good coverage of the really-dangerous cases and the drawback of bad coverage of callsites that only *sometimes* call script (e.g. the "then" getter involved in this case!). The second option is to put these checks at higher-level entrypoints. `ResolvePromise` is a bit too high-level; it makes more sense to put it in `GetProperty` somewhere, since `ResolvePromise` *always* calls `GetProperty`, right?

As far as what the check should be checking... there isn't anything specific right now to check, unfortunately. We could add something, but doing it *fast* would be an issue, unless we stored it on the JSContext itself or something like that.

Bobby may have some thoughts too; I thought he'd planned on this sort of enforcement initially with AutoEntryScript.

> AutoEntryScript does not actually seem to defer microtask resolution

Ugh. I was sure that `AutoEntryScript` had an `AutoMicroTask` inside, but apparently not? Looks like `CallSetup` does separate microtask management as well.

I think that's pretty unexpected and we should *definitely* have an AutoMicroTask as part of AutoEntryScript, though some consumers that want to defer the microtask checkpoint until later than ~AutoEntryScript might need a separate AutoMicroTask anyway.

We'd need to audit consumers, sadly, to make sure we don't coalesce microtasks across too much stuff. For example, `CustomElementReactionsStack::InvokeReactions` will sometimes have an AES live across all the reactions (!), which would probably give the wrong microtask semantics...

The good news is we only have about 50 uses of AutoEntryScript. The bad news is that I expect most are broken wrt microtasks; we should be able to write tests for this...

So [bug 1181740](/show_bug.cgi?id=1181740 "NEW - Replace nsAutoMicroTask with a class that does both a microtask and an entry script that takes ownership of error reporting") was sort of about removing the cases when we have "nsAutoMicroTask but not AES". The discussion above is removing cases when we have "AES but not nsAutoMicroTask"...

I'm sure I don't understand the constraints enough, but at least within this bug's tunnel-vision I am worrying solely about promise resolution happening unexpectedly early. And so `ResolvePromise` (or maybe `ResolvePromiseInternal`) is the underlying-est primitive to target that particular gang-aft-agley scenario. And promise resolving/rejecting is a drawn-out slow process that could tolerate one more check.

If things go awry for other stuff like `GetProperty` or any function call at all, those are probably not code paths that could support a check of this every time they happen...I would think. We'd need better can-run-script attributing or something else for that.

Ah. I was worried about script running without an AES on the stack, which is also a bad thing that we need to prevent.

We have [bug 1108262](/show_bug.cgi?id=1108262 "REOPENED - Audit use of AutoJSAPI and replace it when needed with AutoEntryScript") on file for that, at least. I think we discussed this a few times over the years, but never acted on it. Would certainly be worth making this whole situation less foot-gun-y.

I originally wanted to do this, but IIRC you and/or smaug insisted that the spec required otherwise. I have a few IRC logs from that era I could dig up if that's helpful.

> but IIRC you and/or smaug insisted that the spec required otherwise

I don't think it would have been me, because I am pretty sure I did not pretend to understand microtasks back then.

The really big question is whether all the places where we have AutoEntryScript correspond to the spec pushing things on the JavaScript context stack... Really whether they correspond to <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#prepare-to-run-script> and <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#clean-up-after-running-script> -- the former basically does a thing that means "no microtasks will run" and the latter will run microtasks if it's the outermost script execution.

[Maybe another bug I found?](attachment.cgi?id=9125293)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9125293&action=edit)

So in the course of writing minimal testcases (before wrangling them into wpt shape), I happened to write this testcase. Obviously it fails without this patch...but it fails this assertion

```
    // The WriteInto callback changes mState to eChecking.
    MOZ_ASSERT_IF(ok, mState == eChecking);

```

immediately after `JS::ReadableStreamUpdateDataAvailableFromSource` finishes.

Moreover, it fails that assertion even with this patch in place.

This *probably* is just because `alert` means nested event queues or other insanity along those lines, but I don't know. The assert here is in `BodyStream.cpp`, so it could be a problem with `BodyStream.cpp`. Maybe this assertion assumes the invisibility/un-alterability of the update-data-available action, that is belied by this stupid `"then"` interposition mandated by promises?

Is there an additional problem here, worth a separate bug, that is not just "`alert` is known to be terrible"? And if there is one, how ought I go about filing a bug on it in a way that doesn't inadvertently reveal the existence of this bug?

Will do.

Given this is security and all, I'm a bit paranoid about just adding explanatory comments, so I moved the removal of the assertion into my patch, commandeered your revision (hopefully without changing author, or at least the revision I submitted with `moz-phab` had you set as author) and made it add the comment, then submitted those with the test on top of them.

I'm still floundering my way through the spec idioms some, so I'm going to go for approvals and not hold that up for whatever spec changes may be needed here.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Someone who understands the precise ramifications of a missing microtask queue setup probably can attack the absence of this patch pretty easily.

If they're doing the trick that was done here -- abuse streams code that presumes promises are never fulfilled synchronously -- the failure mode is accessing off the end of (what can be made to be) a heap allocation, then interpreting that data as a `JSObject*`, then using it as if it were valid. It's probably not *entirely* easy, but if you have that much rope I expect a capable attacker *probably* can get to arbitrary code execution.

If they're doing some other trick, that abuses the absence of an `AutoEntryScript`, I do not understand the ramifications of this enough to say what the bad things that can happen are. Except that apparently they are Bad.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: Goes back to at least esr68, so of them
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: The patch applies cleanly to beta.

ESR68 has this code in `dom/fetch/FetchStream.cpp`, but it's pretty easy to make the necessary changes. I've made them locally, will post that patch in a sec.

* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It's a pretty straightforward patch, unlikely to cause regressions. Definitely on the safer side, but probably not *entirely absolutely* safe.

It would have caused us trigger microtask checkpoint when entering chrome JS.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: See previous comments.
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Pretty straightforward to add script entrypoint/microtask handling here, changes are pretty understandable. The changes have a variety of interesting *implications* that are not drop-dead simple, so if I had the option I'd probably rate it somewhere between low and medium. But I don't, and the change couldn't be any smaller, and `AutoEntryScript` and `nsAutoMicroTask` are both widely used so are generously exercised, so it seems to shade a bit closer to low than to medium.
* **String changes made/needed**:

Only when there's no content JS on the stack already, right? I guess that could still be an issue if there are places which effectively post a microtask while not in the scope of an nsAutoMicrotask, whether in our impl or in the spec?

Well that was dumb, can't use `MutexAutoUnlock` which is RAII to affect a previously-declared thing that is *also* RAII. Time for some wonderfully terrible `Maybe<MutexAutoLock>`. 😬 Try churns away...again.

I probably should have clarified -- not just as a comment on the trunk-targeted phabricator rev -- that the esr68 patch has not been updated with the amendments to the trunk patch. (This system where we have two separate places to record progress, here and phabricator, is such garbage. :-( )

Flags: needinfo?(jwalden)

Well this is interesting. It appears this problem affected more browser engines than just us:

<https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1029>

That looks like the hackaround workaround I initially thought was needed here, but really the problem was with our DOM code not deferring the processing. I'll keep poking there and see if we can't get the root cause fixed in whatever the relevant spec is.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
