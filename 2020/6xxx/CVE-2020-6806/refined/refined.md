  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing protection against state confusion in `BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady`. By crafting promise resolutions, it's possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read by resizing an array during script execution while the code is still accessing the old array size, before it has been updated.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds read due to incorrect handling of array resizing in `BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady`.",
         "Missing `AutoEntryScript` in `BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady` which allows promise resolution to execute synchronously and create race condition."
      ],
      "impact": "Memory corruption and potentially exploitable crash. An attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": "A crafted web page or script that manipulates promise resolutions to trigger an out-of-bounds read.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious website or control a website's content, and have the victim open it in a vulnerable browser. The attacker needs to understand how the promise resolution algorithm synchronously accesses the `then` property of the resolution object and how to synchronously trigger promise reactions. They also need to exploit the missing `nsAutoMicroTask` when promises resolve."
