Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the OpenSIS v7.3 login page. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-supplied input (username) into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.
- **Error Messages:** The application's detailed error messages, which expose the complete SQL query, further exacerbate the issue, providing valuable information to an attacker and facilitating exploitation.
- **Direct SQL Queries:** Embedding SQL queries directly within the PHP code is a poor security practice that makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application as an administrator.
- **Remote Database Compromise:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to manipulate or exfiltrate data from the database, potentially leading to data breaches or complete database compromise.
- **Exposure of PII:**  Since OpenSIS is a school information system, a successful attack could expose sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of students and staff.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is the login form of the OpenSIS v7.3 application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the OpenSIS login page, which is typically available over the internet or within a local network.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:**  Basic knowledge of SQL and SQL injection techniques are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need any credentials to attempt the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable SQL query is located in `index.php` at line 117:
  ```php
  $login_uniform = DBGet(DBQuery('SELECT * FROM login_authentication WHERE UPPER(USERNAME)=UPPER(\'' . $username . '\') AND UPPER(PASSWORD)=UPPER(\'' . $password . '\')'));
  ```
- The attacker can use the following payload in the `username` field to bypass authentication:  `') or 1=1;-- -`

This payload modifies the SQL query to:
```sql
SELECT * FROM login_authentication WHERE UPPER(USERNAME)=UPPER(NULL') or 1=1;-- -) AND UPPER(PASSWORD)=.....
```
- The `or 1=1` clause makes the query always return true. The `-- -` is used to comment out the rest of the SQL statement.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered and reported on January 7, 2020, and patched by January 13, 2020.
- While the provided content mentions that the SQL tautology no longer bypasses authentication in newer versions, the newest version of OpenSIS still throws a verbose SQL syntax error if a `'` is submitted upon login. This suggests that database compromise is still possible using other SQL injection techniques (like with SQLMap).
- The blog post also mentions the existence of numerous school systems using OpenSIS, suggesting potentially widespread vulnerability.
