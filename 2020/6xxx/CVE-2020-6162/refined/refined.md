**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The changelog reveals a history of various security vulnerabilities in `bftpd`, including buffer overflows, double-frees, memory leaks, and other memory-related issues. Many of these were caused by improper handling of user input (like long strings or malformed commands) or flawed logic in memory management. There were also some vulnerabilities related to default configuration settings.

This changelog provides more detailed vulnerability information than the standard CVE description for CVE-2020-6162, as it encompasses the entire development history of bftpd.

It should be noted that while there are many entries, not all are security related. Some are about bug fixes or improvements that do not directly relate to security vulnerabilities.

**Note:** There is no mention of CVE-2020-6162, it's likely this changelog predates this CVE or the CVE is for a later version. Based on the changelog contents it appears that a buffer overflow is the most common vulnerability present in the history of this software.
