Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6105:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in how f2fs (Flash-Friendly File System) handles multiple backing devices. An f2fs filesystem can specify multiple files to back its blocks.  The `f2fs_super_block` structure contains an array of `f2fs_device` structs that define these backing devices, including their paths and the number of segments they cover.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** By crafting a malicious f2fs image, an attacker can specify arbitrary files as backing devices. The `f2fs.fsck` utility will then attempt to read from and write to these files based on the block ranges assigned to each device in the f2fs super block.
- **Path Traversal (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, there's an implication that the file paths in the `f2fs_device` structs are not sufficiently sanitized or validated, allowing the potential for path traversal attacks to access files outside the intended scope (though not directly demonstrated in the write-up).
- **Out-of-bounds Read (Minor):**  The `strdup` function call in the `init_sb_info` function can cause an out-of-bounds read if the last device path in the array is not null-terminated. This is mentioned as a minor issue.
- **Lack of proper device validation:**  The vulnerability exists because the f2fs.fsck utility allows arbitrary file paths to be defined as backing devices without proper validation and restriction. The program uses `stat64` to check the path, but doesn't restrict the access of the file based on the type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by creating a specially crafted f2fs image that specifies `/proc/self/mem` as a backing device and then write malicious data to the process memory. This method requires a way around ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
- **File System Modification:**  The vulnerability allows for modification of arbitrary files, potentially corrupting other filesystems or system files. 
- **Privilege Escalation:**  On Android, the vulnerability can be exploited during boot because the `f2fs.fsck` tool is executed on the `/data` partition which uses the f2fs filesystem. Exploiting the vulnerability can give root access in context during boot.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious f2fs image:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted f2fs filesystem image containing the malicious device paths and block mappings.
- **Physical Access:** On Android, the attacker would require either physical access to the device or temporary root access to write to block devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a malicious file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted f2fs image to the system where `f2fs.fsck` will be executed.
- **Privileged Access (Android):** On Android devices, the attacker would need to write to block devices, which requires either physical access or a temporary root access.
- **Bypass ASLR (code execution):** If the attacker wishes to achieve code execution via writing to process memory, they would need a way to bypass ASLR.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is an intended feature of the f2fs filesystem.
- The vulnerability exists because the `f2fs.fsck` utility uses the read/write syscalls and the linux kernel does not fail these calls if writing to unmapped areas of `/proc/self/mem` .
- The f2fs file system is used on android devices for the `/data` partition, which is checked during boot, which makes it vulnerable to exploitation during boot.
