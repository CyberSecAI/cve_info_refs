The content is related to CVE-2020-6069.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `igcore19d.dll` JPEG parser of the Accusoft ImageGear library. The vulnerability occurs in the `sub_5B9D45C0` function during the processing of specially crafted JPEG files. The `loop_limit` variable, derived from the image width, allows the loop to iterate beyond the allocated buffer, causing the out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking within the JPEG parser. Specifically, the loop that processes the image data iterates based on the image width (`x_image`), but it does not check if the buffer can hold the data that is being written.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, which can result in remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted JPEG file using the `IG_load_file` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malformed JPEG file to the victim. No special privileges or access to the target system is required.
