Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of client-side authentication. The RSLogix 500 software sends a request to a MicroLogix controller. The controller then responds with password values to authenticate the user on the client side. This means the authentication process happens on the client (RSLogix 500 software), not on the server (MicroLogix controller) which allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Client-Side Authentication (CWE-603):** The system relies on the client to verify the user's identity using values sent by the server. This is flawed because an attacker can intercept or manipulate these values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism entirely.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information by intercepting password values.
*   **Credential Leakage:**  Attackers can leak credentials and potentially access the controller without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated access:** An attacker can send a malicious request using the RSLogix 500 software to a vulnerable MicroLogix controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the target MicroLogix controller.
*   **Knowledge of RSLogix 500 protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests that mimic RSLogix 500 traffic to exploit the authentication bypass.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
*   Affected products include MicroLogix 1400 controllers, MicroLogix 1100 controllers, and RSLogix 500 Software.
*   The vendor, Rockwell Automation, recommends updates to affected systems.
