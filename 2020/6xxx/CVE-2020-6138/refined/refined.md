The content is related to CVE-2020-6138.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `uname` parameter within the password reset functionality of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `uname` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful attack can allow an attacker to access sensitive information such as usernames, password hashes, and other data stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/opensis/ResetUserInfo.php` endpoint. The `uname` parameter within this request is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters to exploit. No prior authentication is required, as the vulnerability is present in the password reset functionality.
