Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6823:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()` function within Firefox's WebExtensions API. This function, designed to handle OAuth authentication flows, was incorrectly returning the final redirect URL, regardless of whether it matched the extension's registered redirect URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Redirect Handling:** The `launchWebAuthFlow()` function would return the redirect URL even when the service provider redirected to a URL not belonging to the extension, exposing the authorization code to a malicious extension.
*   **Bypass of OAuth Security:** This behavior allows an attacker to bypass the security mechanisms of OAuth flows by using a valid redirect URI of a legitimate app to obtain authorization codes intended for that app, even when the attacker's extension has a different ID.
*   **Lack of Redirect Validation:** The function didn't validate if the redirect URL matched the extension's registered redirect URL, which is the expected behavior of OAuth flows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** A malicious extension could intercept the authorization code meant for another app after the user authenticates with an OAuth provider, gaining access to the victim's account on that service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a direct privilege escalation, the ability to access user accounts on third-party services via a malicious extension is a significant security breach. This is a form of privilege escalation in the context of a web extension.
*   **Data Exposure:** The attacker can access any data the user has authorized for the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Extension:** The attacker creates and publishes a malicious web extension for Firefox.
*   **OAuth Flow Initiation:** The malicious extension uses `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()` with a crafted authorization URL containing a legitimate registered redirect URI of a target app.
*   **Redirection Interception:** The attacker can obtain authorization codes even when the redirect goes to another domain because of the incorrect behavior of  `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Extension Development:** The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a web extension for Firefox.
*   **Knowledge of OAuth:** The attacker needs an understanding of OAuth flows.
*   **Valid Redirect URI and Client ID:** The attacker needs access to a valid redirect URI and client ID of the targeted OAuth provider. This info is often publicly available within browser-based apps.
*   **Victim Install:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to install the malicious extension.

**Additional Notes from Bugzilla:**

*   The issue was initially considered a moderate security risk (sec-moderate), but it was later re-evaluated to have a high impact on affected users.
*   The fix involved forcing the `redirect_uri` to be the extension's URI, preventing extensions from passing arbitrary values and validating the final redirect URL before returning the result.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 75.

In summary, CVE-2020-6823 is a vulnerability where a malicious Firefox extension could exploit a flaw in the `browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()` function to obtain authorization codes meant for other apps by controlling the redirect\_uri, leading to potential account takeovers.
