| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

I believe there is a potential out-of-bounds write in GMPDecodeData [1]:

```
  GMPDecodeData(const webrtc::EncodedImage& aInputImage, bool aMissingFrames,
                int64_t aRenderTimeMs)
      : mImage(aInputImage),
        mMissingFrames(aMissingFrames),
        mRenderTimeMs(aRenderTimeMs) {
    // We want to use this for queuing, and the calling code recycles the
    // buffer on return from Decode()
    mImage._length = aInputImage._length;
    mImage._size =
        aInputImage._length +
        webrtc::EncodedImage::GetBufferPaddingBytes(webrtc::kVideoCodecH264); // <-- pick huge enough _length such that _length + 8 overflows
    mImage._buffer = new uint8_t[mImage._size];                               // <-- allocate array smaller than _length
    memcpy(mImage._buffer, aInputImage._buffer, aInputImage._length);         // <-- copy _length bytes

```

I'm not sure if this is easy to trigger or if it's really any more serious than

a crash, but seemed worth reporting. Apologies if this turns out to not be a

concern.

a) could only apply to 32-bit builds (but that's valid)

b) \_length *and* the buffer it points to would have to be an actual memory buffer of ~4GB (which is very unlikely to be possible)

c) encoded input images are very likely constrained in size before this point (to way less than 4G), but that can be checked

d) adding a backup error-out-on-too-big (or release-assert) here wouldn't hurt even if c) is correct that this can't happen currently.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Not easily.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Attached patch should apply cleanly.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Very unlikely, this adds an assertion for a condition we're unlikely to ever hit.

|  | |

browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow() always returns the URL to where is redirected in the opened webview. This is a big security issue.

When a Firefox Add-On uses the browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow() method, the service provider's authorization URL is passed as mandatory parameter. This URL contains among other things the redirect\_uri to where the service provider should redirect the user after the user has authenticated at the service provider. The authentication part of the OAuth flow all happens in a webview that Firefox automatically launches after calling launchWebAuthFlow().

The redirect\_url used, should be a registered, and thus known, url at the service provider.

This redirect\_url can be the url of the add-on itself (obtained by browser.identity.getRedirectURL()), in which case the user will be redirected back to the Add-On. This redirect\_url can also be something else.

The current behaviour in Firefox is that the Promise returned by browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(), always resolves with the URL to where is redirected. Also in the case this redirect\_url is not the same url as obtained by browser.identity.getRedirectURL() (the Add-On url). The result is that I can obtain the code passed in the redirect\_url's queryparams, even when the redirect goes to another domain.

Possible exploit:

An attacker can exploit this when he/she knows at least 1 registered redirect\_url of an app that uses OAuth (which does not have to be under his control). He can just call the browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow("<https://auth.service.provider.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=ClientId&redirect_uri=https://the.registered.redirect_uri.org/>") with given parameter. It doesn't matter where the service provider redirects the users after authenticating, the Promise returned by browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow() resolves with the redirect URL, containing the auth\_code (assuming the user authenticated correctly)

How to reproduce:

1. Setup up basic OAuth 2 server
2. Register a redirect\_uri at the server

Step 1 and 2 represent the OAuth server of an existing (not our own) application

Next steps are the Attackers actions:

3. Make a new Firefox Add-On (only valid manifest.json and background page necessary)
4. Call browser.identity.launchWebAuthFlow({url: "<https://authserver.com/auth?redirect_uri=https://the_registered_redirect_url.com&client_id=registeredClientId>", interactive: true}).then((url)=>{console.log(url)})
5. Authenticate correctly with OAuth app
6. See the redirect\_url logged in console.

Using this method the Attacker can counterfeit an Add-On, and use the same redirect\_uri as the real Add-On. But after the redirect, use the Auth code obtained. Even though the Add-On's0 id is not registered at the service provider.

The url `https://eodcacbkjencjlinmmdhdmflokbmbbka.chromiumapp.org/` is registered at the OAuth provider.

After redirection, the OAuth provider redirects the user to <https://eodcacbkjencjlinmmdhdmflokbmbbka.chromiumapp.org/>, and the Promise resolves with "<https://eodcacbkjencjlinmmdhdmflokbmbbka.chromiumapp.org/?state=6cx5s&code=DRUbG6dVa41Vq8OFDTS4TM83L58jN>" which contains the code.

This allows a Firefox Add-On to obtain auth codes from redirect url's which did not redirect to the domain of the Add-On but to a totally different one.

As you can see, following the same flow in Google Chrome, with the redirect\_url registered at the service provider, but from an Extension with another id. The resolved return from the Promise is undefined and an error is thrown.

The documentation (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity/launchWebAuthFlow>) does explain the current flow:

> Return value:
>
> A Promise. If the extension is authorized successfully, this will be fulfilled with a string containing the redirect URL. The URL will include a parameter that either is an access token or can be exchanged for an access token, using the documented flow for the particular service provider.

But this should only occur, when the user is indeed redirected to the Add-On ([https://<add-on-id>.extension.allizom.org/](https://%EF%BF%BDadd-on-id%3E.extension.allizom.org/)), not when user gets redirected to any URL.

This part seems to have been wrongly documented when the mdn API doc page has been created:

`redirect_uri` isn't an actual parameter of the `launchWebAuthFlow` method (in both Firefox, see [API schema here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1db5ef59eba65d32d6a29a494e87b6078453e559/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/identity.json#161-168), and Chrome, see [API docs here](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/identity#method-launchWebAuthFlow))

The `redirect_url` is instead an optional parameter of the `url` passed from the extension into the `identity.launchWebAuthFlow` method.

Shane did work on this API, I'm going to discuss about this issue with Shane and we will look more deeply into it

The issue here is specifically that an addon can pass redirect\_uri as a part of the url passed into launchWebAuthFlow. If the oauth service redirects *to that* uri, then we return the results to the addon. The api does not return information from *any* redirect, just redirects to the url that is provided in redirect\_uri. This is by design. So the question is really whether this design is a problem.

An extension could much more easily use a proxy or webrequest listener to intercept oauth codes. It's also possible to just open a tab with an extension page that does oauth on its own without using this api and probably do exactly the same thing. Given that we generally trust addons as a part of the browser I don't really see this as a problem.

I also seem to recall that some oauth services would simply not work with the generated domains so allowing the passing of redirect\_uri was necessary.

nonetheless I'll try to dig up a second opinion.

Ok, with a lengthy chat with dveditz the second opinion is that we should force redirect\_uri to be the extensions uri, disallowing extensions to pass that in.

I agree with the reporter and apparently the Chrome team. If the redirect\_url isn't a match[\*} of the result of getRedirectURL() then the OAuth server did not mean to give the token to that WebExtension and we should return an error. For compatibility we should match Chrome -- I assume they reject the promise, but maybe they resolve with something that is an error rather than a URL.

If a WebExtension wants to authorize as FooSite.com then it should do it from a content script running in a FooSite context.

[\*] "match" is probably something like /^`{getRedirectURL() result}`[/?].\*/ -- whatever is Chrome compat (which will be easier to figure out from their code than by experiment).

> I also seem to recall that some oauth services would simply not work with the generated domains so allowing the passing of redirect\_uri was necessary.

Do we know why? Would the same extension code in Chrome have the same problem?

It was over 3 years ago, so memory could be bad. It might actually have been that we always included redirect\_uri in the url and some services reject that.

Thanks for the quick responses and fix! I have two questions:

Is it known when/what Firefox version the fix will be released?

What is the further process for classifying the eligibility for the Client Bug Bounty program?

The fix has not been checked in yet (when it is this bug will be RESOLVED FIXED). Assuming that's soon this should be fixed in Firefox 75. Because it's a lesser severity security bug and has a risk of site breakage we are not likely to rush this into an earlier release. That also assumes that testing (particularly real-world Beta testing) goes well in terms of web compat -- if it breaks too many sites/extensions it could be back to the drawing board.

The bug bounty folks usually wait until bugs are fixed to take a look, since at that point we know exactly what the scope of the problem is. The nomination flag is on this bug so it'll get looked at. If you have further bounty questions they are best addressed in mail to security@mozilla.org since the folks working in the bug won't know.

I am curious how the severity of this bug (sec-moderate) is established. When I look at the [security severty rating](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings) Authentication Flaws (which lead to account compromise) is listed under sec-critical.

I do believe this bug is more severe than is established right now. Exploiting this bug I can for example make an "Official Google Black Friday search extension", and make users log in with their Google accounts. I can intercept the access tokens and gain access to their account.

If you could pull this off from the general web, for all users, then this would definitely be sec-high. In this case you would first have to convince your victims to install your malicious extension. We've generally interpreted that requirement as capping the severity at sec-moderate since it would slow the spread of an attack and would get blackholed once discovered.

I'm not sure I understand the severity. Full extent of this vulnerability is a bad guy convincing the user to install an extension (which doesn't ask for `google.com` or `<all_urls>` permissions), and hoping that user already installed one of X other extensions with IDs known to the attacker, and that they went through the auth flow with one of them. Is that about right?

I'm not sure we've ever seen a malicious extension that doesn't already ask for `<all_urls>`, or at least `google.com` if they are named "Official Google something...".

Hi Tomislav,

This vulnerability has nothing to do with manifest host permissions. Also there is no need for the victim to have any other extension installed.

The vulnerability is that when the attacker knows a valid redirect url and client id (and sometimes client secret) of an OAuth provider (like Google), he can develop an extension implementing this OAuth flow, even though the extension's ID is not registered (and known) at this OAuth provider.

And with OAuth implemented in browser based apps like SPAs and webextensions, these redirect url, client id and client secret are all public information.

We're debating whether this should be uplifted. This breaks some set of extensions, currently researching the situation.

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert, Kenneth Russell
Impact
high
##### Description

When reading from areas partially or fully outside the source resource with WebGL's `copyTexSubImage` method, the specification requires the returned values be zero. Previously, this memory was uninitialized, leading to potentially sensitive data disclosure.

Reporter
Deian Stefan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

On 32-bit builds, an out of bounds write could have occurred when processing an image larger than 4 GB in `GMPDecodeData`. It is possible that with enough effort this could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2020-6824: Generated passwords may be identical on the same site between separate private browsing sessions](#CVE-2020-6824)

Reporter
Matthew Noorenberghe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Initially, a user opens a Private Browsing Window and generates a password for a site, then closes the Private Browsing Window but leaves Firefox open. Subsequently, if the user had opened a new Private Browsing Window, revisited the same site, and generated a new password - the generated passwords would have been identical, rather than independent.

#### [#CVE-2020-6825: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 75 and Firefox ESR 68.7](#CVE-2020-6825)

Reporter

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 74 and Firefox ESR 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
