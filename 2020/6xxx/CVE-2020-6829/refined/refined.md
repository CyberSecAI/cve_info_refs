Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the non-constant time wNAF (windowed Non-Adjacent Form) scalar multiplication function used in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) implementation within Network Security Services (NSS) library, specifically when using NIST_P384 or NIST_P521 curves. The wNAF algorithm computes EC point doubling at each iteration, with a conditional branch depending on non-zero scalar digits, which computes an EC point addition. This branch introduces a timing difference based on the scalar digits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Side-Channel Leakage:** The conditional branch within the wNAF scalar multiplication algorithm leads to timing differences that are observable through side-channels. This is because point doubling and point addition operations take different amounts of time.
- **Non-Constant Time Implementation:** The core issue is that the wNAF algorithm is not implemented in a constant-time manner. This means that the execution time of the algorithm varies based on the secret data (the scalar), allowing an attacker to potentially learn about the scalar by observing the timing of the operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Key Recovery:** By observing the timing differences via side channels (specifically EM emanations, but also other software-based channels such as timing or cache), an attacker can extract the position of zero and non-zero wNAF digits. This leaks partial information about the ECDSA nonce used in signature generation.
- **Cryptographic Break:** Given enough signatures and the partial nonce information, the attacker can use this information to recover the private key of the target system. This undermines the security of the system's ECDSA signatures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Side-Channel Analysis:** The vulnerability is exploited through side-channel analysis techniques that monitor the execution of the vulnerable function during ECDSA signature generation.
- **EM Emanations:** The initial report highlights the use of ElectroMagnetic (EM) emanations to extract timing information related to point doubling and addition operations.
- **Software-Based Channels:** The vulnerability is also exploitable through various software-based side channels, including timing variations and cache timings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Proximity/Access:** EM-based attacks require physical access or proximity to the targeted system to capture EM emanations.
- **Ability to Generate Signatures:** The attacker needs the ability to induce the vulnerable system to generate ECDSA signatures so they can observe the timing differences in the scalar multiplication.
- **Side Channel Measurement Equipment:** The attacker needs tools to capture and analyze the side-channel signals (e.g. EM probes, timing analysis software).

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects the `ec_GFp_pt_mul_jm_wNAF` function in `lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_jm.c`, which is used for scalar multiplication with NIST P-384 and P-521 curves.
- The fix replaces the non-constant time wNAF calls with a constant-time implementation, specifically through the use of a custom ECGroupStr for P-384 and P-521 using formally verified and constant time code from FIAT crypto library.
- The issue also affects the wNAF encoding function `ec_compute_wNAF` at `lib/freebl/ecl/ec_naf.c` which was also exploitable via software-controlled side-channels.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-6829 is a side-channel vulnerability in the NSS library's ECDSA implementation. The use of the non-constant-time wNAF algorithm during scalar multiplication allows attackers to extract timing information and recover private keys via side-channel attacks. The vulnerability is present in the handling of the NIST P-384 and P-521 curves and requires physical or close access for EM based attacks and the ability to trigger ECDSA signature generation.
