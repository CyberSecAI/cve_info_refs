The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6122.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page. Specifically, the parameters `fn`, `mn`, `ln`, `byear`, `bmonth`, and `bday` are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper neutralization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). The `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` script constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input from the `$_REQUEST` array without proper sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, such as student information.
- Modify or delete existing data within the database.
- Potentially gain control of the database server depending on the database permissions and the nature of the injected SQL queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page. Attackers can inject SQL code into the vulnerable parameters (`fn`, `mn`, `ln`, `byear`, `bmonth`, and `bday`) within the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated since the queries use session variables such as `$_SESSION['UserSyear']` and `$_SESSION['UserSchool']`.
- No special network position is required to send malicious requests, the attacker could be any user with valid credentials.
