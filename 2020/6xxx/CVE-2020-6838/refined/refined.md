The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6838.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free in the `hash_values_at` function within the `mruby-hash-ext` component. The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of operations on a hash object using the `values_at` method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a crash. This occurs because of incorrect memory management during the processing of `values_at` on a hash object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The primary impact is a crash of the mruby interpreter due to a memory access violation.
- Potential for further exploitation: Although not explicitly stated, heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks such as arbitrary code execution, if the memory layout is predictable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted Ruby code that uses `values_at` on a hash with specific inputs.
- Execution of untrusted code: If an attacker can execute arbitrary mruby code, they could trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute mruby code: An attacker needs to be able to execute mruby code, either by providing a malicious script or through a vulnerable application that uses mruby.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability: An attacker needs to be aware of the specific sequence of operations that trigger the vulnerability.
