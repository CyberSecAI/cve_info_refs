Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the FactoryTalk Diagnostics software. Specifically, the software exposes a .NET Remoting endpoint via `RNADiagnosticsSrv.exe` at TCP port 8082, which is susceptible to this insecure deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The software does not properly validate or sanitize data received by the .NET Remoting endpoint before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution with SYSTEM level privileges. This means an attacker could gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be carried out remotely by sending malicious data to the vulnerable .NET Remoting endpoint over TCP port 8082.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any prior access to the system other than network connectivity to the vulnerable port.
- **Low skill level:** The advisory indicates a low skill level is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the advisory:**
- **Affected Products:**  All versions of FactoryTalk Diagnostics software, specifically versions 2.00 to 6.11 are affected
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
- **Mitigations:**
   - Upgrading to FactoryTalk Service Platform version 6.20 or later
   - Applying patch BF24822 for specific versions to restrict connection settings
   - Disabling the Remote Diagnostics Service if not needed
   - Using Windows Firewall to restrict connections to the affected port
- **Researcher:** Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative, working with rgod of 9sg, reported the vulnerability.
- **Affected Sectors:** Food and Agriculture, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems
