Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient policy enforcement within the developer tools component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Policy Enforcement:** The core issue is that the browser fails to adequately enforce security policies within its developer tools. This lax enforcement allows an attacker to bypass intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially achieve a sandbox escape. This means they could break out of the browser's security sandbox, gaining access to resources and system functionalities that should be protected.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In a sandbox escape scenario, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** As a consequence of the sandbox escape, sensitive data from the process memory or disk could be disclosed to the attacker.
*   **Potentially obtaining sensitive information:** The vulnerability could allow for the retrieval of sensitive data stored within the browser's process memory or disk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Chrome Extension:** The attack requires the user to be tricked into installing a malicious Chrome extension.
*   **Crafted Chrome Extension:** The attacker would utilize a specially crafted Chrome extension to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to employ social engineering techniques to convince the user to install the malicious extension.
*   **Malicious Extension Development:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious Chrome extension that can exploit the policy enforcement flaw in the developer tools.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious extension, most likely via a network.

**Summary of CVE-2020-6471:**

The vulnerability is a medium severity issue, and is related to insufficient policy enforcement within Chromium's developer tools. The exploit can only occur if the user installs a malicious extension, which in turn enables an attacker to potentially escape the browser sandbox and execute arbitrary code with sensitive information disclosure.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Chromium version 83.0.4103.61 and later.
*   Several Linux distributions, including Fedora, openSUSE and Debian, have released security updates to address this issue.
*   This CVE is part of a large batch of security fixes rolled out in Chromium 83, including use-after-free issues, type confusions and other policy enforcement issues.
