Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-6785:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" (CWE-427). This means that the affected Bosch software (BVMS and BVMS Viewer) loads DLL files without properly validating their location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking/Preloading:** The applications are susceptible to loading malicious DLLs if they are placed in the same directory as the application's executable or installer. This occurs because the application searches for required DLLs in the current working directory before searching in the system's standard directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system, within the security context of the user running the application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the victim's machine.
*   **User Interaction:**  The victim must be tricked into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable application or installer, and then execute the application/installer. This can be achieved by social engineering methods or by leveraging other vulnerabilities to place the malicious DLL on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Machine Access:** An attacker needs some form of access to the target system.
*   **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker would need to convince the victim to place a malicious DLL in a specific directory.
*   **Malicious DLL Creation:** The attacker must be capable of creating a malicious DLL that can be executed by the vulnerable application.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
* Bosch BVMS < 9.0.0
* Bosch BVMS 10.0 < 10.0.2
* Bosch BVMS 10.1 < 10.1.1
* Bosch BVMS Viewer < 9.0.0
* Bosch BVMS Viewer 10.0 < 10.0.2
* Bosch BVMS Viewer 10.1 < 10.1.1
* Bosch DIVAR IP 7000 R2 with configuration: ‘using vulnerable BVMS version’
* Bosch DIVAR IP all-in-one 5000 with configuration: ‘using vulnerable BVMS version’
* Bosch DIVAR IP all-in-one 7000 with configuration: ‘using vulnerable BVMS version’

**Mitigations:**

*   **Software Updates:** The primary mitigation is to update to the patched versions of Bosch software which address the DLL loading issue.
*   **Secure Execution Locations:** Do not run installers from user-writable directories like "Downloads".
*   **Directory Permissions:** Avoid placing executables in directories where low-privileged users have write permissions.
*   **User Awareness:** Users should be aware of social engineering attacks and not download files from untrusted sources or move executable to user-writeable directories.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided advisory indicates that this DLL hijacking vulnerability affects not only the installers, but also the installed applications themselves (for BVMS/BVMS Viewer).
