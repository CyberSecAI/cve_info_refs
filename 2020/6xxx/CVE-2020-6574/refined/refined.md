Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-6574:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an "Insufficient policy enforcement in installer" within Google Chrome on macOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Policy Enforcement:** The core issue is a lack of proper checks and enforcement of policies within the installer component of Chrome on macOS. This allows an attacker to bypass intended security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system. This means an attacker with limited access could potentially gain higher-level control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have some form of access or presence on the target macOS system.
*   **Crafted Binary:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious binary that leverages the insufficient policy enforcement during the installation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target machine.
*   **Ability to Create/Modify Binaries:** The attacker must have the ability to create a crafted, malicious binary that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **macOS target:** The vulnerability is specific to Chrome on macOS systems.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information also indicates that a fix for this vulnerability is included in Chrome version 85.0.4183.102.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.8, indicating a high severity.
*   The attack is performed by a local user without requiring any interaction, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the target machine could be impacted.

The information provided is more detailed than the official CVE description, providing information about the affected platform (macOS), the nature of the crafted binary, and the impact as a privilege escalation, rather than the vague "potentially achieve privilege escalation."
