Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-6821:

**CVE-2020-6821**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `copyTexSubImage` method in WebGL not properly initializing destination pixels when reading from out-of-bounds areas of the source resource. Instead of writing zeros, it leaves the destination pixels with uninitialized data.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Uninitialized Memory Use:** The core issue is the failure to initialize destination texture data when copying from an out-of-bounds source. This exposes potentially sensitive data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could read data from uninitialized GPU memory belonging to other processes. The data leakage could potentially include sensitive information from other running applications, particularly on macOS where cross-process GPU memory access appears possible.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **WebGL API Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `copyTexSubImage` method with out-of-bounds source coordinates.
    *   **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker could host a malicious webpage containing WebGL code designed to trigger the vulnerability.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious webpage to the victim (e.g., via a link).
    *   **WebGL Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of WebGL and its API.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed to be reproducible on macOS and Linux but not on Windows 10.
*   The leaked memory appears to be generally constrained to in-process GPU memory, however, there was evidence of cross-process leakage on macOS.
*   The difficulty of exploiting this vulnerability is elevated by the fact that the attacker must detect and exfiltrate interesting/sensitive data from potentially large images of uninitialized memory.

**Summary of Fix:**
The fix involves ensuring that the `copyTexSubImage` method properly initializes the destination pixels with zeros before copying data.
