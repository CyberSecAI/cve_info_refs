- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `USERNAME` parameter within the `/opensis/index.php` login functionality. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without adequate sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database, modifying data, or performing other malicious actions. The CVSS score of 9.8 indicates a critical severity due to the high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/opensis/index.php` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `USERNAME` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
