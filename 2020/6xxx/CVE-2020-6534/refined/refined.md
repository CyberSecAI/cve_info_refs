Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-6534:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow within the WebRTC component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses:**
- Heap buffer overflow: This indicates a flaw in memory management where a program attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential memory corruption.
- Vulnerability within WebRTC: Exposes a specific component for handling real-time communications within the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap corruption: A successful exploit can corrupt the heap memory, potentially leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could inject and execute malicious code.
    - Information disclosure: Sensitive data residing in memory could be leaked.
    - Denial of service: The application could crash, becoming unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker: The attack is launched remotely, typically over the network.
- Crafted HTML page: An attacker can deliver a malicious payload via a specially crafted HTML document. This document can exploit the heap overflow when processed by a vulnerable browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access: The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the target.
- Ability to deliver malicious HTML: The attacker must have a way to get a victim to open the crafted HTML page using a vulnerable version of Google Chrome. This can be through social engineering, website injection, etc.
