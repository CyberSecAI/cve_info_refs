Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6060

**Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Mini-SNMPD due to improper handling of multiple TCP connections and socket disconnections. Specifically, the code responsible for removing disconnected clients from a list incorrectly decrements the list length within a loop before the loop condition check, leading to closed sockets not being properly removed. This results in `FD_SET` being called on an invalid file descriptor (-1), which attempts to write before the allocated set array causing the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The core issue is writing beyond the boundaries of a stack-allocated buffer used for managing file descriptors.
*   **Incorrect List Management:** The flawed logic in removing disconnected clients from the list creates the condition that triggers the overflow.
*   **Use of potentially invalid file descriptors with `FD_SET`:** The code does not validate file descriptors before passing to `FD_SET`, allowing an invalid file descriptor (-1) to be used, which triggers the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack buffer overflow leads to the termination of the Mini-SNMPD process, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of TCP connections over the network to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target device running the vulnerable Mini-SNMPD service.
*   **Ability to open multiple TCP connections:** The attacker needs to be able to open and close multiple connections to the target port.
*   **No authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered by connection behavior, not the content of any specific request, so no authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is triggered when multiple sockets are closed, due to the incorrect list management logic.
*   The standard C library's buffer overflow detection mechanism triggers and terminates the process when `FD_SET` is called with a negative file descriptor or a file descriptor beyond the size of the allocated set.
*   The provided code snippet shows how to trigger the vulnerability by creating multiple connections and closing some of them, which triggers the vulnerability on the next `select` loop.
