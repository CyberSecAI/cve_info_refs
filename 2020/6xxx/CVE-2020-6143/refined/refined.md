The content is related to CVE-2020-6143.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `install/Step5.php` file of the OS4Ed openSIS software, specifically within the password variable. This allows for the injection of arbitrary PHP code into the `Data.php` configuration file during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Static Code Injection (CWE-96):** The primary weakness is the improper neutralization of directives in statically saved code, enabling an attacker to inject PHP code into the `Data.php` file via the password parameter during the install process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the openSIS application. In the example, the injected code `phpinfo()` allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP functions on the system.
-   **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the injected code, an attacker could potentially achieve full system compromise of the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/install` endpoint of the openSIS application.
-   **Unprotected Install Directory:** The vulnerability is exploitable because the install directory is not removed after installation, which makes the installation page still accessible and allows for overwriting existing settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server where openSIS is installed.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The installation page does not require authentication, making it accessible to anyone.
-   **MySQL Server instance:** The attacker can setup a fake mysql server with the `skip-grant-tables` option.
