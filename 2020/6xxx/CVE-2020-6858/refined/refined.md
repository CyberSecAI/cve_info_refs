Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6858:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-6858 and provides detailed information about the vulnerability, confirming it is related.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of CRLF (carriage return line feed) sequences in HTTP headers within the `styx` library.
*   The core issue is the disabling of built-in HTTP header validation in Netty, a network application framework, in two key components:
    *   `com.hotels.styx.api.HttpHeaders.Builder`
    *   `com.hotels.styx.server.netty.connectors.StyxToNettyResponseTranslator`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting'):** By disabling Netty's header validation, the application becomes vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks. This occurs when an attacker can inject CRLF characters into an HTTP header, allowing them to manipulate the structure of the HTTP response.
*   Specifically, the use of `new DefaultHttpHeaders(false)` and `new DefaultHttpResponse(version, httpResponseStatus, false)` disables Netty's validation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary headers or even an entire HTTP response by manipulating the vulnerable header.
*   This could lead to various attacks including:
    *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts.
    *   **Cache poisoning:** Serving malicious content from caches.
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session IDs.
    *   **Arbitrary content injection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves injecting CRLF sequences into HTTP headers via user-controlled input such as query parameters or other request parameters which are then used to populate the vulnerable headers.
*   In the provided proof of concept (PoC), the `header-value` query parameter is used to inject CRLF characters: `String encodedGet = URLEncoder.encode("test\r\nAnother: CRLF_Injection");`
*   The injected CRLF sequences are then used in header values through a plugin, showing how these can be exploited in the context of the application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to influence the values of HTTP headers within the application.
*   This can be achieved by controlling input parameters or other data sources that are used to construct HTTP headers.
*   No specific user privileges or network position is explicitly stated besides being able to send a request to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using a query contributed to the Semmle QL project.
*   The fix involves enabling Netty's built-in header validation by using `new DefaultHttpHeaders(true)` and `new DefaultHttpResponse(version, httpResponseStatus, true)`.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates how an injected header value with CRLF sequences passes through the plugin without any errors, highlighting the lack of validation.
*   The content mentions similar vulnerabilities in other libraries and provides links to those advisories.

In summary, CVE-2020-6858 describes an HTTP response splitting vulnerability in the `styx` library due to disabled header validation. This allows an attacker to manipulate HTTP responses by injecting CRLF sequences into headers, leading to a variety of potential attacks.
