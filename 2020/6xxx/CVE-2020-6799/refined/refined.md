    "CVE-2020-6799": {
      "description": "Arbitrary code execution when opening pdf links from other applications, when Firefox is configured as default pdf reader",
      "additional_details": true,
      "root_cause": "Command line arguments could be injected during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for certain unsupported file types due to insufficient sanitization of URL data by a third party application. The issue stems from how Windows parses command-line arguments when double quotes are present in the file path.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Remote Code Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user by injecting command line arguments into a Firefox invocation. This is done by having the user open a specially crafted file via a third party application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "File association abuse via Windows registry",
         "Third party application with insufficient URL sanitization"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open a file using a third party application. The user must also have set Firefox as a default application for a filetype other than HTML. The attacker also requires a specially crafted file containing the malicious arguments.",
      "patches": [
        "The fix involves adding the '-osint' flag to the Firefox registry key to ensure that Firefox ignores any command line arguments that have been injected when Firefox is activated via the Windows registry",
        "The installer/updater preemptively creates `{HKLM,HKCU}\\Applications\\firefox.exe` and fill it in with the correct command line."
