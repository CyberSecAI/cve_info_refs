# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2020-1029

## atftpd daemon Denial of Service Vulnerability

##### August 26, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-6097

### Summary

An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the atftpd daemon functionality of atftp 0.7.git20120829-3.1+b1. A specially crafted sequence of RRQ-Multicast requests trigger an assert() call resulting in denial-of-service. An attacker can send a sequence of malicious packets to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

atftp 0.7.git20120829-3.1+b1

### Product URLs

<https://github.com/seveas/atftp>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-617 - Reachable Assertion

### Details

atftp is an open source TFTP server implementation. The ‘a’ stands for
“advanced”, because it’s intended to be fully compliant with all related
RFCs including RFC1350, RFC2090, RFC2347, RFC2348 andRFC2349.

A remote attacker may send a sequence of crafted RRQ-Multicast requests to the
atftpd, triggering an assert() call in the atftpd code which results in abort
of atftpd.

The vulnerablility can be traced down to the function: sockaddr\_print\_addr within
tftp\_def.c. where an unexpected sockaddr\_storage \*ss data with “ss\_family=AF\_UNSPEC”
reaches the assert() call in the ‘else’ branch (line #192).

The vulnerable code snippet (tftpd\_file.c)

```
183 char *
184 sockaddr_print_addr(const struct sockaddr_storage *ss, char *buf, size_t len)
185 {
186      const void *addr;
187      if (ss->ss_family == AF_INET)
188           addr = &((const struct sockaddr_in *)ss)->sin_addr;
189      else if (ss->ss_family == AF_INET6)
190           addr = &((const struct sockaddr_in6 *)ss)->sin6_addr;
191      else
192           assert(!"sockaddr_print: unsupported address family");
193      return (char *)inet_ntop(ss->ss_family, addr, buf, len);
194 }

```

An instance of “sa\_family=AF\_UNSPEC” is also seen in the strace output below,

```

Package        : atftp
Version        : 0.7.git20120829-3.1~deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-6097 CVE-2021-41054

Two issues have been found in atftp, an advanced TFTP client.

```
Both are related to sending crafted requests to the server and triggering
a denial-of-service due to for example a buffer overflow.
```

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.7.git20120829-3.1~deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your atftp packages.

For the detailed security status of atftp please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/atftp>
