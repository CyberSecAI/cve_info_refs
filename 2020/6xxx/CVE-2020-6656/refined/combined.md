## (0Day) Eaton EASYsoft E70 File Parsing Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1444ZDI-CAN-11083

| CVE ID |  |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Eaton |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | EASYsoft |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Eaton EASYsoft. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of E70 files.

Eaton Vulnerability Advisory

ETN-VA-2020-1009: Multiple security issues in Eaton’s easySoft Software

Date

01/21/2021

Overall Risk

Medium

CVSS v3.0

5.8

 v1.1

Overview

Eaton has been made aware of security vulnerabilities in its easySoft software used to program easy
controllers and displays. The software provides circuit diagram input and editing, and the diagrams
can be displayed in the format desired. An integrated offline simulation tool allows users to test a
circuit diagram before commissioning. It supports users who are configuring, programming and
defining parameters for all the intelligent relays and creating visualization functions for the MFD
displays

Vulnerability Details

CVE-2020-6655

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.8 – AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

CWE-125: Out-of-bounds read

CWE-20: Improper input Validation

The easySoft software v7.xx prior to v7.22 are susceptible to Out-of-bounds read remote code
execution vulnerability. A malicious entity can execute a malicious code or make the application crash
by tricking user to upload the malformed .E70 file in the application. The vulnerability arises due to
improper validation and parsing of the E70 file content.

References – ZDI-20-1443

CVE-2020-6656

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.8 – AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L

CWE-843: Access to Resource Using Incompatible Type (‘Type Confusion’)

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

The easySoft software v7.xx prior to v7.22 are susceptible to file parsing type confusion remote code
execution vulnerability. A malicious entity can execute a malicious code or make the application crash
by tricking user upload a malformed .E70 file in the application. The vulnerability arises due to
improper validation of user data supplied through E70 file which is causing Type Confusion.

References – ZDI-20-1444, ZDI-20-1442, ZDI-20-1441

Note: - There are currently no reports of the vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

Eaton Vulnerability Advisory

v1.0

Affected Product(s) and Version(s)

Product – easySoft Software

Version – 7.xx prior to 7.22

Remediation & Mitigation

Remediation

Eaton has patched the issues and released a new version 7.22. The latest version can be
downloaded from Eaton’s web site

- easySoft easy Controller and Display Programming Software | Eaton

- Navigate to Eaton software download center -> Select “Software” -> “easySoft” -> v7.22

Mitigation

Only use .E70 files that are either created by you or have been acquired from a fully trusted source.

If the application crashes due to .E70 file upload, restart the application and don’t upload the .E70
again.

General Security Best Practices

•  Restrict exposure to external networks for all control system devices and/or systems and

ensure that they are not directly accessible from the open Internet.

•  Deploy control system networks and remote devices behind barrier devices (e.g. firewalls,

data diodes) and isolate them from business networks.

•  Remote access to control system networks should be made available on a strict need-to-use
basis. Remote access should use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs),
updated to the most current version available.

•  Regularly update/patch software/applications to latest versions available, as applicable.
•  Enable audit logs on all devices and applications.
•  Disable/deactivate unused communication channels, TCP/UDP ports and services (e.g.,

SNMP, FTP, BootP, DHCP, etc.) on networked devices.

•  Create security zones for devices with common security requirements using barrier devices

(e.g. firewalls, data diodes).

•  Change default passwords following initial startup. Use complex secure passwords  or

passphrases.

•  Perform regular security assessments and risk analysis of networked control systems.
