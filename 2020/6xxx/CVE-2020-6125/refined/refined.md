The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6125.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `GetSchool.php` page of OS4Ed openSIS 7.3. The `u` parameter in the GET request is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `u` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because the input is not sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `GetSchool.php` page with a malicious payload in the `u` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can initiate the attack remotely via HTTP.
