    "CVE-2020-6542": {
      "description": "A code execution vulnerability exists in the WebGL functionality of Google Chrome 84.0.4147.89 and 85.0.4169.0 (Developer Build) (64-bit). A specially crafted web page can cause a use-after-free condition. An attacker can create a special website to trigger this vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in the ANGLE library, a compatibility layer between OpenGL and Direct3D, used by the Google Chrome browser. Specifically, a use-after-free condition happens in the `Buffer11::getBufferStorage` function. The `newStorage` element, which should point to a valid memory location, may point to previously freed memory, leading to a crash when the browser attempts to access it.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's machine.",
      "attack_vector": "A specially crafted web page can trigger the use-after-free condition.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website. The victim needs to visit this website with a vulnerable version of Google Chrome.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in `Buffer11::getBufferStorage` function within the ANGLE library.\n\nSpecifically, the `mBufferStorages` array, containing pointers to BufferStorage objects is freed in the Buffer11 destructor.  Subsequently accessing a freed `BufferStorage` pointer causes the crash.\n\nStack trace and crash information is also included which provides information on function calls which lead to the crash.\n\nConfirmed vulnerable versions: Google Chrome 84.0.4147.89 and Google Chrome 85.0.4169.0 (Developer Build) (64-bit)."
