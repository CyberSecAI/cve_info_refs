Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-6165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The automatic permission checking mechanism in the `silverstripe/graphql` module failed to properly filter lists of records that were limited (e.g., through pagination). This resulted in records that should have failed the permission check being included in the final result set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Access Control:** The primary weakness lies in the inadequate permission checking within the `silverstripe/graphql` module when dealing with limited (e.g. paginated) queries.
- **Bypass of Permission Checks:**  The vulnerability allowed users to potentially bypass intended permission restrictions when accessing data through GraphQL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of records that a user should not have access to, although it does not allow unauthorized modification of records.
- **Exposure of restricted data:**  Users with limited permissions could potentially access records that would usually require higher privileges, especially for content exposed via `admin/graphql` endpoints

**Attack Vectors:**

- **GraphQL Endpoints:** The vulnerability is primarily exploitable through GraphQL endpoints.
- **CMS Access:**  The default CMS configuration means that the vulnerability is exploitable by CMS users (even with limited permissions) through the `/admin/graphql` endpoint.
- **Custom GraphQL Endpoints:** If custom GraphQL endpoints are configured (usually under `/graphql`), this vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **CMS Access (Default):** For the default configuration, an attacker would need to be a user with access to the Silverstripe CMS.
- **Limited Permissions:** The vulnerability is most relevant when the attacker has limited permissions, as the vulnerability allows bypassing these.
- **Access to GraphQL Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to a vulnerable GraphQL endpoint, either default (`/admin/graphql`) or custom (`/graphql`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability only affects reading records (information disclosure). It does not allow for unauthorized modification of data.
- The issue was addressed in `silverstripe/graphql` versions `3.2.4` and `3.3.0`.
- The provided text also gives a CVSS score of 5.3, indicating a medium severity.
- The document explicitly mentions that custom GraphQL queries may need validation after upgrade to ensure they still function as expected.

This information provides a good overview of the vulnerability and its implications, aligning with the typical expectations for a CVE description.
