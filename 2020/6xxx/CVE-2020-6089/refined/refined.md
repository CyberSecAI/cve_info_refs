Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a heap buffer overflow in the Leadtools ANI file format parser. Specifically, the `lfAniX.DLL` library is affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** When parsing an ANI image file, a buffer is allocated based on the `display_rate` value from the `RATE` header. Subsequently, the buffer is populated using the `width` value from the `ANIH` header.
- **Insufficient Size Check:**  The code doesn't validate if the allocated buffer is large enough to accommodate the data being written using the `width` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By providing a specially crafted ANI file, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow leading to heap corruption. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can provide a malicious ANI file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious ANI file using an application that utilizes the vulnerable Leadtools library.
- **File Delivery:**  The attacker needs to deliver the malicious ANI file to the victim's system.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable function allocates a buffer based on a rate header value, then fills it with data using a width value.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:

```
LfAniX+0x1578
if ( rate_header.signature == 'etar' )
{
    v10 = L_LocalAllocInit(
            (unsigned int)rate_header.display_rate,
            1i64,
            345i64,
            ...);
    v57 = v10;
    if ( v10 )
        L_RedirectedRead(v6, v10, (unsigned int)(4 * anih_header.width));
}
```

- By providing a small `display_rate` and a large `width`, the attacker causes the write operation using `L_RedirectedRead` to overflow the allocated buffer.

**CVE Information:**
- CVE-2020-6089 is assigned to this vulnerability.
- CVSSv3 Score: 8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- CWE: CWE-787 - Out-of-bounds Write

**Affected Product:**
- Leadtools 20 and potentially other versions that utilize the vulnerable `lfAniX.DLL` library.
