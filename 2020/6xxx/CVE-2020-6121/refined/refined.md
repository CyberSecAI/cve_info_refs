- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page in OS4Ed openSIS 7.3 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in several parameters. Specifically, the `ln` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform a variety of malicious actions, including but not limited to: unauthorized data access, data modification or deletion, and potentially gaining control of the underlying database server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` endpoint, including malicious SQL code in the `ln` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application and needs to be authenticated.
