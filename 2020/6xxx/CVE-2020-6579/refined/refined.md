Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6579:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- It exists because user-supplied input is not properly encoded, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the victim's browser.
- Specifically, the `cloudloader_mode` parameter in `cloudloader.php` and `cloudloader_core.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application, which would then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious crafted link that contains the malicious javascript in the  `cloudloader_mode` parameter of the affected files.
- The attacker needs to get a victim to click the malicious link, for example via email or a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious payload in the `cloudloader_mode` parameter.
- They need to entice a user into clicking this malicious URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gerbert Roitburd and Markus Schneider of usd AG during a penetration test.
- The vendor, MailBeez, was contacted and released a fix in version v3.9.22 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable files are located at `/mailhive/cloudbeez/cloudloader.php` and `/mailhive/cloudbeez/cloudloader_core.php`.
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a simple JavaScript alert using the vulnerable parameter.
