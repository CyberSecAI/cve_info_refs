Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the task scheduling component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory after it has been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Other potential impacts: Data corruption and denial of service are also possible consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, likely by enticing a user to visit a malicious website or interact with malicious content within the browser.
- Browser interaction: The specific task scheduling functionality within the browser is exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: An attacker does not need local access to exploit this vulnerability.
- Knowledge of browser internals: The attacker needs specific knowledge about the task scheduling component of Chromium to trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.
- It was reported by Looben Yang on 2020-07-10.
- Patches were included in Chromium version 84.0.4147.125 and later.
- Multiple vendors like Red Hat, Debian and Gentoo released security updates to address this flaw.

**Summary of extracted information:**

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6543
- **Vulnerability:** Use-after-free in task scheduling
- **Affected Component:** Chromium browser's task scheduling
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, potential data corruption, denial of service
- **Attack Vector:** Remote, via malicious website or content
- **Attacker Capability:** Remote attacker with knowledge of Chromium internals
- **Fix:** Chromium version 84.0.4147.125 and later
