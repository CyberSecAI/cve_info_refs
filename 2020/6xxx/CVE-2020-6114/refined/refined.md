- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `ob` parameter of the `/app/data.php` endpoint. This parameter is directly used in the `ORDER BY` clause of an SQL query, resulting in SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and password hashes. The attacker can also potentially modify or delete data.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/app/data.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload within the `ob` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated to make the HTTP request.
