Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-6167:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause was the lack of nonce checks in the plugin's settings update functionality. This allowed for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   The plugin also incorrectly used `is_admin()` for permission checks, leading to unauthorized access for lower-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **CSRF to Stored XSS and Setting Changes (CVE-2020-6167):**
    *   **Weakness:** Absence of nonce checks when processing settings updates.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick a site administrator into submitting malicious requests, leading to arbitrary setting changes, including injecting malicious javascript.
2.  **Insecure Permissions: Enable and Disable Maintenance Mode (CVE-2020-6168):**
    *   **Weakness:** Incorrect use of `is_admin()` function for access control, allowing any authenticated user to trigger administrative actions.
    *  **Vulnerability:** Any logged-in user could enable/disable maintenance mode.
3.  **Insecure Permissions: Export Settings/Theme Change (CVE-2020-6166):**
    *   **Weakness:** Same as above, misuse of  `is_admin()` function for access control.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Any logged-in user could export plugin settings or change the maintenance mode theme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2020-6167:**
    *   **Critical:** Complete compromise of the site's availability and security.
    *   Attackers could enable maintenance mode, inject malicious scripts leading to XSS, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other harmful actions.
    *   Attackers could also manipulate SEO settings, impacting site ranking, or include malicious files as logos.
*   **CVE-2020-6168:**
    *   **High:**  A lower privileged user could take the site offline by enabling maintenance mode.
*   **CVE-2020-6166:**
     *   **Medium:**  An attacker could leak plugin configuration data or modify the site's appearance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF (CVE-2020-6167):** Attackers could create malicious links and trick administrators into clicking on them, triggering unauthorized settings changes.
*   **Direct Request (CVE-2020-6168, CVE-2020-6166):** Any logged-in user could send requests to vulnerable endpoints due to inadequate privilege checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CVE-2020-6167:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a site administrator into clicking a malicious link.
*  **CVE-2020-6168:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an account on the target site with at least subscriber permissions.
*   **CVE-2020-6166:**
    *    The attacker needs to have an account on the target site with at least subscriber permissions.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were patched in versions 2.15 (for CVE-2020-6167 and CVE-2020-6168) and 2.17 (for CVE-2020-6166).
*   The Wordfence firewall offered protection against these vulnerabilities, with premium users getting protection before free users.
*  The plugin developer was responsive and quick to release patches once notified.
