- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses a length read from the PDF file as a loop sentinel when writing data to a heap-based buffer, without proper bounds checking, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122). The application trusts the length value from the file and does not validate against the buffer size.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF document is loaded by a victim using the vulnerable application. The vulnerability is triggered when the application attempts to render the PDF, specifically when handling the `ICCBased` colorspace stroke color.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document. The victim needs to open this document using a vulnerable version of Nitro Pro.
