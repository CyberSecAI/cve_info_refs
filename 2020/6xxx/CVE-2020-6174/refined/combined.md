### @lukpueh **[lukpueh](/lukpueh)** commented [Jan 10, 2020](#issue-548122515)

**Fixes issue #**:

None

**Description of the changes being introduced by the pull request**:

Prior to this PR metadadata signature verification as provided by `tuf.sig.verify()` and used e.g. in `tuf.client.updater` counted multiple signatures with identical authorized keyids each separately towards the threshold.

This PR changes this to count identical authorized keyids only once towards the threshold.

It further clarifies the behavior of the relevant functions in the `sig` module, i.e. `get_signature_status` and `verify` in their respective docstrings. And adds tests for those functions and also for the client updater.

An alternative fix is outlined in the commit message of [a0397c7](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/commit/a0397c7c820ec1c30ebc793cc9469b61c8d3f50e) (including a patch).

**Please verify and check that the pull request fulfills the following

requirements**:

* The code follows the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines#code-style-guidelines)
* Tests have been added for the bug fix or new feature
* Docs have been added for the bug fix or new feature

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Fix signature threshold verification](/theupdateframework/python-tuf/pull/974/commits/a0397c7c820ec1c30ebc793cc9469b61c8d3f50e "Fix signature threshold verification

Prior to this commit metadadata signature verification as provided
by `tuf.sig.verify()` and used e.g. in `tuf.client.updater` counted
multiple signatures with identical authorized keyids each
separately towards the threshold. This behavior practically
subverts the signature thresholds check.

This commit fixes the issue by counting identical authorized keyids
only once towards the threshold.

The commit further clarifies the behavior of the relevant functions
in the `sig` module, i.e. `get_signature_status` and `verify` in
their respective docstrings. And adds tests for those functions and
also for the client updater.

NOTE: With this commit signatures with different authorized keyids
still each count separately towards the threshold, even if the
keyids identify the same key. If this behavior is not desired, I
propose the following fix instead. It verifies uniqueness of keys
(and not keyids):

```

I have some reservations about not unique-fying in `tuf.sig.get_signature_status`, but approving because `tuf.sig.verify` is now correct
