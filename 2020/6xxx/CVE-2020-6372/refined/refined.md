Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PDF files by SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during PDF parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write:  Improper validation of user-supplied data leads to a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated buffer. This out-of-bounds write is the primary vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- User Interaction Required: The target user must open the malicious PDF file using the vulnerable SAP 3D Visual Enterprise Viewer to be exploited, or visit a malicious page that uses the viewer to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to the target user.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and no special privileges are required to craft the attack.
