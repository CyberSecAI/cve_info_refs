- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the handling of the Electronic Key Segment within the ENIP Request Path Logical Segment. Specifically, when a reserved format type (0x05-0xff) is used, the device does not properly validate the size of the data following the key format field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient size validation of the key data when a reserved format type is used within the Electronic Key Segment.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device enters a fault state, losing all remote communication capabilities and requiring a physical power cycle to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted network request, specifically an ENIP SendRRData command containing a malicious EPATH with a Logical Segment using a reserved Electronic Key Segment format and insufficient subsequent data bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the Allen-Bradley Flex IO 1794-AENT/B device via the ENIP protocol. No specific authentication or privileges are mentioned as being necessary.
