{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The client attempts to validate all signatures on a metadata file, even if some are invalid. An attacker can add many invalid signatures to a metadata file, causing the client to spend a significant amount of time on validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The client does not immediately fail upon encountering an invalid signature during metadata verification.",
      "Lack of mechanism to limit the number of signatures processed in metadata files"
    ],
    "impact": "Client-side Denial of Service. A client may become unresponsive for minutes or potentially longer, especially if multiple files are affected, due to excessive signature verification attempts.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker gains write access to the repository's metadata files.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to modify metadata files (specifically by adding multiple invalid signatures to files such as root.json and target.json).",
      "additional_information": "The file size limit of `target.json` is larger than `root.json` and may allow even more signatures, which further increases the amount of time spent in validation. For example, over 500 invalid signatures in root.json can lead to several minutes of client-side validation."
