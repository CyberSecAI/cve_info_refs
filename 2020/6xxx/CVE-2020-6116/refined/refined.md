- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of a buffer for an indexed color palette, leading to an undersized buffer allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when loading colors into the undersized buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution under the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted PDF document needs to be loaded by a victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document with a crafted indexed colorspace and have the victim open it using a vulnerable version of Nitro Pro.
