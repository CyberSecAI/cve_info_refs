Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of cryptographic verification on uploaded binary blobs within the CODESYS Runtime. Specifically, the runtime system only performs a CRC32 check on the uploaded machine code before execution, which is insufficient for ensuring authenticity and integrity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity:** The primary weakness is the absence of a cryptographic signature to verify the uploaded binary's origin and integrity. The reliance on a simple CRC32 check allows for malicious code to be injected if the attacker can control the contents of the binary and its corresponding CRC value.
*   **Missing Cryptographic Signature:** The lack of a cryptographic signature allows an attacker to bypass the security mechanisms designed to protect the device. The system should verify that the binary originates from a trusted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the target device. By crafting a malicious .app file with embedded shellcode, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the `codesys3` binary, which provides significant control over the device.
*   **Control over PLC:** With code execution, the attacker gains control over the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), potentially manipulating industrial processes or disrupting operations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker executes code with the privileges of the Codesys runtime.
*  **Project Uploads:** The attacker has the ability to upload malicious projects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted network request to the target device.
*   **Proprietary Protocol:** The attack can occur over the CODESYS proprietary protocol on port 11740.
*  **SSH:** The attacker can potentially upload projects via SSH

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target device on the port 11740 or via SSH.
*   **Malicious .app File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious `.app` file with the appropriate architecture containing the shellcode and its corresponding `.crc` file with the correct CRC32 of the `.app` file.
*   **Understanding of CODESYS Protocol:** An understanding of the CODESYS protocol would be necessary to craft the malicious network requests.
*   **Bypassing CRC Check:** The attacker has to be able to create a valid CRC file for the malicious payload to bypass the existing checks.
*  **Authentication Disabled:** The attacker requires that authentication for port 11740 is disabled, if this is not the case then additional exploits are needed.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability allows bypassing of security measures designed for devices configured to block direct access beyond the requirements of IEC 61131 standards
