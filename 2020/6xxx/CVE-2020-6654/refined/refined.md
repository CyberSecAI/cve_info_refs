- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Eaton 9000x Programming and Configuration software versions 2.0.38 and prior are susceptible to a DLL hijacking vulnerability due to an uncontrolled search path when loading DLLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software loads `vci11un6.DLL` and `cinpl.DLL` using an untrusted search path, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking. This is a case of CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element) and CWE-426 (Untrusted Search Path).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code by replacing the vulnerable DLLs (`vci11un6.DLL` and `cinpl.DLL`) with malicious ones. This could lead to a full compromise of the system where the software is running.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to place the malicious DLLs in a location where the vulnerable software will load them instead of the legitimate ones. User interaction (UI:R) is required, likely involving the user launching the application. The attacker does not need to have any special privileges (PR:N).
