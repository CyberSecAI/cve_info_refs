**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data from the database, potentially compromising the entire application and its users' data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to `CoursePeriodModal.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
