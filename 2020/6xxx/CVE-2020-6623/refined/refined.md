- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An assertion failure in the `stbtt__cff_get_index` function within `stb_truetype.h` is triggered by a maliciously crafted font file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `stbtt__cff_get_index` function does not properly validate the `offsize` variable, leading to an assertion failure when its value is not within the expected range (1 to 4).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The immediate impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) due to the program aborting upon assertion failure. This prevents the program from processing the crafted font file and potentially other operations.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted font file provided by the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the vulnerable software with a malicious font file.
