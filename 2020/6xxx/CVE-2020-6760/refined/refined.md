Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-6760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the restricted shell environment accessible via SSH on the ZI 620 V400 VPN Router. While the web interface input was sanitized against command injection, the SSH interface was not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization within the restricted SSH shell. By appending a semicolon (`;`) to a valid menu option, attackers can inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system.
*   **Default Credentials:** The router uses default username and password `root:root`, making initial access extremely easy.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The SSH application does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Gaining shell access allows complete control over the device, enabling actions such as:
    *   Pivoting into the internal network
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The router must be accessible over the network, either locally or remotely.
*   **SSH Access:** The attacker must be able to log in to the device via SSH using the default credentials (root/root) or using alternative credentials if they have been modified.
*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by entering a valid menu option followed by a semicolon (;) and the desired command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attacker needs network connectivity to the target device.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for SSH access (default root/root).
*   **Basic Linux/Command Line Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to execute commands in a Linux environment, including using the semicolon for chaining commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in a router model widely deployed by ISPs in India, potentially exposing thousands of devices.
*   The vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond.
*  The vulnerable version is specified in an attached image, which specifies software version V4.00.06 and hardware version 1.0
