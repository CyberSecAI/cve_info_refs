Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-6073:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from integer overflows within the `rr_read_TXT` function of the `libmicrodns` library when parsing TXT records in mDNS messages. Specifically, the length `l` of a string within the TXT record is read, and the code advances the pointer by `l`. If `l` is equal to or greater than remaining bytes `*n` in the message but `len` (which is the total length of RDATA) is less than `l`, then `*n` and `len` can underflow. The program will then crash due to out-of-bounds reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** Unsigned integer `len` is decremented using a value `l` which can be bigger than `len`. Similarly, `*n` can underflow when `l` is read as the length of a string, causing out of bounds access to the message buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted mDNS message with specific TXT record data, an attacker can trigger the integer overflows, leading to a crash due to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can send a malicious mDNS message to a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send mDNS messages to a vulnerable device or system.

**Additional Details from the provided documents:**

*   **Affected Software:** Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
*   **CWE:** CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound)
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability has been patched in libmicrodns version 0.1.2.
*   **Downstream Impact:** The vulnerability affects the VLC media player, where the libmicrodns library is used as a plugin. Debian has released security updates (DSA-4671-1) to disable the vulnerable plugin in VLC.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo has also released an advisory (GLSA 202005-10) recommending that users upgrade to libmicrodns-0.1.2
