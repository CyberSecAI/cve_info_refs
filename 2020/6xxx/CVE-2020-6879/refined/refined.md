- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input verification vulnerabilities exist in some ZTE devices. The front-end validation can be bypassed, and the backend fails to properly validate input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation in the web service backend, allowing for tampering of parameter values. The front-end validation can be bypassed by crafting a POST request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can tamper with parameter values by exploiting the input validation vulnerability. In this instance, the attacker can change the values used in the configuration of a static routing rule.
- **Attack vectors**: By constructing a POST request message and sending the request to the creation of a static routing rule configuration interface via the web management page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the device's web management interface, thus, they likely need to be on the local network. They need to have low privileges to access the device's web interface.
