| A Security Vulnerability in Some ZTE Products |
| --- |
| Original release date:  November 13, 2020   **CVE ID**  CVE-2020-6879 **CVSS 3.1 Base Score** 3.5 Low（AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N）  **Description** Some ZTE devices have input verification vulnerabilities. The devices support configuring a static prefix through the web management page. The restriction of the front-end code can be bypassed by constructing a POST request message and sending the request to the creation of a static routing rule configuration interface. The WEB service backend fails to effectively verify the abnormal input. As a result, the attacker can successfully use the vulnerability to tamper parameter values.  **Affected Products and Fixes**  | Product Name | Affected Version | Resolved Version | | --- | --- | --- | | ZXHN Z500 | V1.0.0.2B1.1000 | V1.0.1.1B1.1000 | | ZXHN F670L | V1.1.10P1N2E | V1.1.10P2N2 |     **Source** The vulnerability was found by ZTE's internal test.  **Update Records** November 13, 2020, initial.  **Supporting team contacts** 1.  ZTE GCSC hotline:  0755-26770800  800-830-1118  400-830-1118  2.  Product forum at ZTE Support website.  **ZTE PSIRT** If you need to report security vulnerabilities related to ZTE products, or get ZTE product security incident response service and vulnerability information, please contact ZTE PSIRT: psirt@zte.com.cn, PGP key ID: FF095577. |
