The provided content is related to CVE-2020-6119.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `byear` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without any validation or sanitization, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89) stemming from unsanitized input within the 'byear' parameter, which is used in the SQL query in the CheckDuplicateStudent.php page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this case, the impact is rated as low for Confidentiality and Integrity but no impact to Availability as per the CVSS score of 6.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `CheckDuplicateStudent.php` page with a malicious SQL payload in the `byear` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to exploit this vulnerability (PR:L). There are no special user interaction requirements (UI:N).
