- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `down_id` parameter in the `DownloadWindow.php` script is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to potentially extract sensitive data from the database or possibly modify data. The CVSS score indicates a low impact on confidentiality and integrity, and no impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `DownloadWindow.php` page, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code via the `down_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated, meaning they require valid login credentials to access the vulnerable functionality.
