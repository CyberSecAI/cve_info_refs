Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a miscalculation of a pointer within the JPEG2000 stripe decoding functionality of Nitro Pro, specifically when decoding sub-samples.  The application incorrectly calculates the stride used to traverse sub-samples within a tile, allowing the decoder to write data out of bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write due to an incorrect stride calculation when processing sub-sample data. The stride can be larger than the tile for an individual color component, leading to writing beyond allocated memory during stripe decoding. This is due to a failure to account for the width of a stripe potentially being larger than the tiles.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption which allows an attacker to corrupt data structures and achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution under the context of the Nitro Pro application.
- **Application Crash:** The out-of-bounds write can lead to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF document that embeds a malicious JPEG2000 image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Crafted PDF Document:**  The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF document with a specially crafted JPEG2000 image.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious PDF file with the vulnerable Nitro Pro application.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs within the Kakadu JPEG2000 library used by Nitro Pro to decode JPX streams.
- During the tile initialization process, the application calculates a stride value for each sub-sample.
- This stride calculation does not account for situations where the stripe width is larger than the allocated tile, leading to an out-of-bounds write during sub-sample data writing.
- The `kdu_stripe_decompressor` object is involved in the vulnerability.
- The application uses `VirtualAlloc` to allocate the buffer for the tile components but the stride is larger than expected.
- The horizontal stride value that is fetched from the horizontal stride array and copied into the tile is not used during the calculation of the buffer size. This is used in the decoder function to iterate through the buffer. This leads to writing out of the bounds of the buffer allocated.
- The vulnerability is present in the `CAPContent::Wrap` function and its sub-functions that involve JPEG2000 decoding.
