CVE-2020-6113: Nitro Pro PDF Object Stream Parsing Number of Objects Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Root Cause: Integer overflow when calculating memory allocation size for indirect objects within a PDF object stream, leading to an undersized buffer.

Vulnerability:
- Integer Overflow: Calculation to determine buffer size overflows, resulting in a smaller-than-expected buffer. (CWE-190)
- Memory Corruption: Writing outside the bounds of the undersized buffer during initialization.

Impact: Remote code execution. A specially crafted PDF document can trigger the vulnerability, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Nitro Pro application.

Attack Vector: Deliver a specially crafted PDF document to a victim. Opening the document in Nitro Pro triggers the vulnerability.

Attacker Capabilities: Requires the ability to deliver a malicious PDF file to a user who then opens it with a vulnerable version of Nitro Pro.
