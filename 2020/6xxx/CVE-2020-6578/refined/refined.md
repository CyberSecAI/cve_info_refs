Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-6578

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization of the `main_page` parameter in Zen Cart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize the `main_page` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Links:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `main_page` parameter and delivers the URL to the victim through email, social media, or other means.
*   **Compromised Website:** If the vulnerable website is linked to from a compromised website, the malicious script could be injected through this route.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network, however they must be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload, and convince the user to click it.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Files**: The vulnerability was located in `/includes/templates/template_default/common/tpl_main_page.php` and `/includes/templates/responsive_classic/common/tpl_main_page.php`.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to inject HTML/JavaScript code into the application via the `main_page` parameter by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests.
*  **Fix:** The vendor was advised to encode all user-supplied input before rendering it in the web page in order to prevent the injection of HTML code.
