Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25761:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input validation in the `myform.php` file of the "Visitor Management System in PHP 1.0". This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code through request parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the parameters submitted to `myform.php`. This allows an attacker to store malicious JavaScript payloads in the database. These payloads are then executed in the browsers of other users accessing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject JavaScript payloads to perform various attacks, including:
    - Stealing of cookies
    - Accessing sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can send a crafted POST request to `myform.php` with malicious JavaScript code in parameters like `name`, `purpose`, `comment`, etc.
- The stored payload is triggered when a user visits `front.php` and the application fetches the stored visitor data to display.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters in `myform.php`.
- The attacker needs the victim to access the page that retrieves the stored data (`front.php` with the `rid`).
