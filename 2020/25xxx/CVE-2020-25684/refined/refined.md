{
  "CVE-2020-25684": {
    "Description": "A lack of proper address/port check implemented in dnsmasq versions < 2.83 reply_query function makes it easier to forge replies to an off-path attacker.",
    "Root cause": "The `reply_query()` function in dnsmasq does not properly validate the address and port of the DNS response against the pending forwarded queries.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of DNS response address and port",
        "Loose matching of request to response"
    ],
    "Impact": "An off-path attacker can more easily forge DNS replies, leading to potential DNS cache poisoning.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Off-path attacker sending spoofed DNS responses",
        "Attacker within the same network"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable dnsmasq server",
        "Off-path or on-path network position"
      ]
  }
}
