The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25088.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before displaying it in various parts of the application. Specifically, the code uses `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables directly in HTML output without escaping them, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input before reflecting it back to the user's browser within HTML context, thus enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's pages which can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript by exploiting any of the input fields present in the mentioned files. This includes but is not limited to:
- URL parameters (GET requests) such as 'edit' or 'editLang'
- Form fields (POST requests) such as 'username', 'email', 'notify', 'amount', 'code', 'valid_from_date', 'valid_to_date', 'image', 'folder', 'quantity', 'position', 'virtual_products'.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the application through input vectors like GET/POST parameters.
