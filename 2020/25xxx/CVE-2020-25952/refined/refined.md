Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25952 (as referenced in the text)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the login functionality of the "User Registration & Login and User Management System 2.1". The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection in the login form. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query used for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Panel Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.
- **Data Manipulation:** With admin access, the attacker can update and delete user data, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The attack vector is through the admin login form, specifically the User ID and Password fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the login page of the vulnerable application.
- **Basic SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload is: `' or '1'='1`
- This payload, when placed in both the User ID and Password fields, results in a SQL query that always evaluates to true, bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Mitigation:**
- The suggested remediation involves using parameterized queries to separate commands from data, conducting code reviews, and enforcing server-side input validation. Using security-specific libraries is also recommended.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is consistent across multiple sources and provides more context than the official CVE description, which is a placeholder. The exploit was published on exploit-db as EDB-ID 49052.
