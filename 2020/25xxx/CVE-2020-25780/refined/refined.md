- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the "View Log Files" operation allows path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied log file paths, allowing relative paths containing `..` to traverse outside of the intended log files directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view and download arbitrary files from the file system. Files are accessed with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can create a custom application that uses the "view log files" protocol and inject a malicious path with `..` sequences to traverse the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to interact with the Commvault server using the "view log files" protocol. They do not need to be on the server itself.
