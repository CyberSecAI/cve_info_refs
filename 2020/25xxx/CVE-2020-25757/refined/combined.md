DSR Family Products :: F/W v3.17 & Older :: CVE-2020-25757 / CVE-2020-25758 / CVE-2020-25759 : Unauthenticated & Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

On August 11, 2020, a 3rd party security researcher submitted a report accusing the DSR-250 Hardware Revision A1 using firmware v3.17 or older (2) Authenticated remote command execution (1) unauthenticated vulnerabilities. Since this product shares firmware with other models in the DSR Family, DSR-150 / DSR-150N / DSR-250 / DSR-250N / DSR-500 Rev. B / DSR-500AC / DSR-1000 Rev. B / DSR-1000AC will require updates to patch these issues. The two vulnerabilities were confirmed, and patches are under development. One of the reported vulnerabilities is how the device functionally works, and D-Link will not correct it on this generation of products.

**3rd Party Report information**

**Report provided ::** Digital Defense, Inc. Vulnerability Research Team :: [LINK](https://www.digitaldefense.com/)

                     Coordination: Samuel Shapiro:: VulnerabilityResearch \_at\_ digitaldefense \_dot\_ com

**Report :**

**Issue 1:** CVE-2020-25757: Unauthenticated Remote Root Command Injection

**Impact:** Unauthenticated users with access to the "Unified Services Router" web interface, either on LAN or WAN, can inject arbitrary commands via crafted requests, which will be executed with root privileges.

 **Details:** The following lua cgi actions, which are accessible without authentication, execute a lua library function which passes user-supplied data to a call to os.popen() as part of a command intended to calculate a hash: /platform.cgi?action=duaAuth, /platform.cgi?action=duaLogout

**Fix:** Published Below

**Issue 2:** CVE-2020-25759: Authenticated Root Command Injection

**Impact:** Authenticated users with access to the "Unified Services Router" web interface, either on LAN or WAN, can inject arbitrary commands via crafted requests, which will be executed with root privileges.

 **Details:**The Lua CGI, which handles requests from the "Package Management" form in the "Unified Services Router" web interface, has no server-side filtering for the multi-part POST parameters payload, which are passed to os. execute () functions intended to move the uploaded file to another directory.

**Fix:** Published Below

**Issue 3:** CVE-2020-25758: Authenticated Crontab Injection

**Impact:**Authenticated users with access to the "Unified Services Router" web interface, either on LAN or WAN, can inject arbitrary CRON entries, which will be executed as root by modifying a downloaded router configuration file, updating the CRC, and reuploading the resulting crafted configuration file.

**Details:**The configuration file's mechanism is authenticated upon upload is trivially bypassed by a malicious user creating a crafted configuration file that adds new cron entries to execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Response:** D-Link declined recognition of this report. For this generation of product, the device uses a plain text config, which is the design to directly edit and upload the config to the same DSR devices accordingly. If D-Link mitigates issue #1 and #2, as well as other, recently reported issues, the malicious user would need to engineer a way of gaining access to the device to upload a configuration file, so we understand the report but classify the report as low-threat once the patched firmware is available.

# Digital Defense, Inc. Discloses Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in D-Link VPN Routers

By Fortra Staff

#### ***Work From Home Use of Popular VPN Routers Increases Immediacy of Critical Patch***

**SAN ANTONIO, Texas** – **December 8, 2020** – Digital Defense, Inc., a leader in [vulnerability management and threat assessment solutions](https://www.digitaldefense.com/platform/), today announced that its [Vulnerability Research Team (VRT)](https://www.digitaldefense.com/technologies/ddi-vrt/) uncovered a previously undisclosed vulnerability affecting D-Link VPN routers. D-Link DSR-150, DSR-250, DSR-500 and DSR-1000AC VPN routers running firmware version 3.14 and 3.17 are vulnerable to a remotely exploitable root command injection flaw.

These devices are commonly available on consumer websites/ecommerce sites such as Amazon, Best Buy, Office Depot and Walmart. Given the rise in work-from-home due to the pandemic, more employees may be connecting to corporate networks using one of the affected devices.

The vulnerable component of these devices is accessible without authentication. From both WAN and LAN interfaces, this vulnerability could be exploited over the Internet. Consequently, a remote, unauthenticated attacker with access to the router’s web interface could execute arbitrary commands as root, effectively gaining complete control of the router. With this access, an attacker could intercept and/or modify traffic, cause denial of service conditions and launch further attacks on other assets. D-Link routers can connect up to 15 other devices simultaneously.

> *“Our standard practice is to work in tandem with organizations on a coordinated disclosure effort to facilitate a prompt resolution to a vulnerability. The Digital Defense VRT reached out to D-Link who worked diligently on a patch. We will continue outreach to customers ensuring they are aware and able to take action to mitigate any potential risk introduced by the vulnerability,” states Mike Cotton, senior vice president of engineering at Digital Defense.*

D-Link is a global leader in designing and developing networking and connectivity products for consumers, small businesses, medium to large-sized enterprises and service providers. Since 1986, the company has grown into an award-winning global brand with over 2,000 employees in 60 countries. D-Link’s line of VPN routers enable remote workers to connect securely to company resources.

**What You Can Do**

D-Link’s recent advisory provides more details about the updates that have been released, which should be applied: <https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10195>​. For additional information, customers should contact D-Link directly.

**Digital Defense Research Methodology and Practices**

The Digital Defense VRT regularly works with organizations promoting the responsible disclosure of zero-day vulnerabilities. The expertise of the VRT, when coupled with the company’s next generation hybrid cloud platform, [Fortra Vulnerability Management](https://www.digitaldefense.com/platform/frontline-vm/?pressrelease), enables early detection capabilities. When zero-days are discovered and internally validated, the VRT immediately contacts the affected vendor to notify the organization of the new finding(s) and assists, where possible, with the vendor’s remediation actions.
