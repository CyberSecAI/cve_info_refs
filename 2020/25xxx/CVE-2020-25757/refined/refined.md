Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-25757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization in specific Lua CGI actions within the D-Link DSR series routers' web interface.
*   Specifically, the `/platform.cgi?action=duaAuth` and `/platform.cgi?action=duaLogout` actions execute a Lua library function. This function passes user-supplied data directly to `os.popen()` as part of a command to calculate a hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Injection:**  The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands. This is due to the unsanitized user-supplied data being passed to the `os.popen()` function.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The web interface does not validate or sanitize user inputs before using them in system calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected router.
*   **Root Privileges:** The injected commands are executed with root privileges, granting the attacker full control over the device.
*   **Compromised Router:** An attacker can intercept/modify network traffic, cause denial of service, and use the compromised router as a launchpad for attacks on other assets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible through the router's web interface on both LAN and WAN.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the web interface to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:**  Exploitation involves sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Lua CGI actions ( `/platform.cgi?action=duaAuth` and `/platform.cgi?action=duaLogout` ).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target router either via LAN or WAN.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects D-Link DSR-150, DSR-150N, DSR-250, DSR-250N, DSR-500 Rev. B, DSR-500AC, DSR-1000 Rev. B, and DSR-1000AC devices running firmware version 3.17 and older.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Digital Defense Vulnerability Research Team.
