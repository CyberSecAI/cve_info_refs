The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in Qualcomm's QCMAP (Qualcomm Mobile Access Point) software suite. One of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2020-25859.

**CVE-2020-25859 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability within the QCMAP\_CLI binary.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `QCMAP_LAN::EnableGatewayUrl` function constructs a command using `snprintf` with a user-controlled gateway URL and executes it via `system()`. There is no input validation for shell metacharacters, allowing command injection.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with the privileges of the `QCMAP_CLI` process. This could lead to full device control.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the QCMAP_CLI through the CLI interface, specifically using the gateway URL setting option.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have access to the device's CLI interface. This likely requires some level of access to the device.
