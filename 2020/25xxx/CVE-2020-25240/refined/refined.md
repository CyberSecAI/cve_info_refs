- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect authorization allows unprivileged users to access services by guessing URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization (CWE-863) leads to unauthorized access to services.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could impact availability, integrity, and gain information from logs and templates. Specifically, the attacker could potentially:
    - Impact availability of the service.
    - Impact the integrity of the service (modify data).
    - Gain access to information contained in logs and templates.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), and exploitation requires low attacker skill (AC:L) and only low privileges (PR:L). User interaction is not required (UI:N), with no change in scope (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and a valid but unprivileged user account. They must also be able to guess the URLs.
