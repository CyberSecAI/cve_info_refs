**Recommendation for End of Service Life Products**

While D-Link is aware of the alleged vulnerabilities involving the DNS-320. These products have reached End of Life(EoL)/End of Support(EoS), and there is no extended support or development for them.

D-Link will be unable to resolve Device or Firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

From time to time, D-Link will decide that sure of its products have reached EOL. D-Link may choose to EoL a product for many reasons, including the shift in market demands, technology innovation, costs or efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and is replaced by functionally superior technology.

For US consumers,for EOL/EOS products the recommendation D-Link brand products sold by D-Link in the US be retired, and any further use may be a risk to devices connected to it and end-users connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these products against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware from <https://legacy.us.dlink.com/>, installed, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration and always have WiFI encryption enabled with a unique password.

Disclosure of vulnerabilities in D-LInk DNS320

 [Raw](/WinMin/6f63fd1ae95977e0e2d49bd4b5f00675/raw/d1d26252714357df026597b4db4f3e035fe2eb4c/Disclosure%2520of%2520vulnerabilities%2520in%2520D-LInk%2520DNS320.md)

[**Disclosure of vulnerabilities in D-LInk DNS320.md**](#file-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-in-d-link-dns320-md)

## Disclosure of vulnerabilities in D-LInk DNS320

## Version

firmware version is v2.06B01 (ftp://ftp2.dlink.com/SECURITY\_ADVISEMENTS/DNS-320/REVA/DNS-320\_REVA\_FIRMWARE\_v2.06B01.zip)

## Details

First of all, let's download the relevant firmware.

```
wget ftp://ftp2.dlink.com/SECURITY_ADVISEMENTS/DNS-320/REVA/DNS-320_REVA_FIRMWARE_v2.06B01.zip

```

unpack the firmware and go to the 'cgi' directory,then use ida load the 'system\_mgr.cgi' binary , we found

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87623514-1fa24880-c758-11ea-948b-ac2ec2449295.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87623514-1fa24880-c758-11ea-948b-ac2ec2449295.png)

There is command injection in the 'cgi\_ntp\_time' function:

The value of 'v6' is spliced with "(sntp-r% s > / dev/null"), and then passed into system for execution.The value of 'v6' is obtained from the statement `cgiFormString ("f_ntp_server", v6,64);`

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87624029-47de7700-c759-11ea-8d73-b8eb8150fd15.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87624029-47de7700-c759-11ea-8d73-b8eb8150fd15.png)

We look at the relevant references to the 'cgi\_ntp\_time' function by cross-referencing (xhot key).

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87624226-c76c4600-c759-11ea-9f39-87de6ada4ef5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18380453/87624226-c76c4600-c759-11ea-9f39-87de6ada4ef5.png)

When the value of 'cmd' is equal to 'cgi\_ntp\_time', the 'cgi\_ntp\_time' fucntion will be called.

## The sample PoC

```
poc:
/cgi-bin/system_mgr.cgi?C1=ON&cmd=cgi_ntp_time&f_ntp_server=`id`

```
## TimeLine

July 7, 2020: Report to D-Link

July 16, 2020: Confirmed

July 16, 2020: Vendor Disclosure: <https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10183>
