Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25097:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Squid's handling of HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of input, which allows a trusted client to bypass Squid's security controls. Specifically, it allows for HTTP Request Smuggling.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** A trusted client can inject malicious requests that are processed by Squid as legitimate, potentially accessing services forbidden by Squid's security configuration.
- **Disclosure of sensitive information:** The vulnerability could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests sent by a trusted client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position considered a "trusted client" by the Squid proxy.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft specific HTTP requests that exploit the input validation flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Squid versions up to and including 4.13 and 5.x up to and including 5.0.4
- This issue is resolved in Squid versions 4.14 and 5.0.5.
- A workaround exists by configuring squid.conf with `uri_whitespace deny` or `uri_whitespace encode` to prevent the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability allows HTTP Request Smuggling.
