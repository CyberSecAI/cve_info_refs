Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2020-25217:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `url` POST parameter in the `/cgi-bin/api-traceroute_and_ping` API of Grandstream Networks' GRP261x VoIP phone firmware version 1.0.3.6 (Base) was not properly sanitized by the server. This lack of sanitization leads to a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands into the `url` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Remote Code Execution: An attacker with network access to the device can remotely execute commands as the privileged user `root`.
- Device Compromise: This could lead to the installation of malware, modification of system behavior, and staging of further attacks.
- High severity: The impact is high because the vulnerability allows a complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the administrative web interface of the vulnerable device.
- HTTP POST Request: The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable API endpoint with a malicious payload in the `url` parameter.
- Authentication: This vulnerability requires authentication, but when combined with CVE-2020-25218, unauthenticated remote code execution is possible

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Network access to the vulnerable device's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
- If used alone, authentication to the web interface is needed, but can be bypassed in combination with CVE-2020-25218

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Grandstream Networks' GRP261x VoIP phones, specifically in firmware version 1.0.3.6 and likely earlier versions.
- Grandstream Networks released a patch in version 1.0.5.27 (October 2020) of the GRP162x software to address this vulnerability.
