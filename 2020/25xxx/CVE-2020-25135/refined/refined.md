{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when generating graphs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code within the application, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the context of other users' browsers, session hijacking, or defacement of the web application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to the `/graphs` endpoint.",
       "The malicious javascript payload is injected via the `graph_title` parameter.",
        "The server response includes the injected payload in a way that allows it to execute within the context of the user's browser."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to craft a URL with a malicious payload. This does not require prior authentication or elevated privileges and may be performed remotely.",
   "additional_information" : "The identified vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability, meaning that the malicious script is injected via the URL and reflected back in the application's response."
