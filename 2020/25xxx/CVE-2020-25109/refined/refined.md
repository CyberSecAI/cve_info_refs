  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The function in Nut/Net that processes DNS questions/responses has several issues, including a lack of checks on whether a domain name is NULL-terminated, the DNS response data length is not checked, the number of DNS queries/responses is not checked against the data present, and the length byte of a domain name is not checked and is used for internal memory operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to corrupt memory, put devices into infinite loops, access unauthorized data, and/or poison DNS cache.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to use specially-crafted network packets to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the targeted device."
