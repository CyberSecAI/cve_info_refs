The content is related to CVE-2020-25169.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected Reolink P2P products do not sufficiently protect data transferred between the local device and Reolink servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319). Data is not encrypted when transmitted between the local device and Reolink servers.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access sensitive information, such as camera feeds. This could also allow further compromise of Reolink P2P cameras.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker could intercept the unencrypted network traffic between the device and Reolink servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with network access, able to intercept traffic between the camera and Reolink servers can exploit this vulnerability. Low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.
