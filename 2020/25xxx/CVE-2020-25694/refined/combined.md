# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : postgresql-9.6
Version        : 9.6.20-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-25694 CVE-2020-25695 CVE-2020-25696

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the PostgreSQL database system.

CVE-2020-25694

    Peter Eisentraut found that database reconnections may drop options
    from the original connection, such as encryption, which could lead
    to information disclosure or a man-in-the-middle attack.

CVE-2020-25695

    Etienne Stalmans reported that a user with permissions to create
    non-temporary objects in an schema can execute arbitrary SQL
    functions as a superuser.

CVE-2020-25696

    Nick Cleaton found that the \gset command modified variables that
    control the psql behaviour, which could result in a compromised or
    malicious server executing arbitrary code in the user session.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
9.6.20-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.6 packages.

For the detailed security status of postgresql-9.6 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/postgresql-9.6>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-04 09:00:45 UTC  ``` Many PostgreSQL-provided client applications have options that create additional database connections.  Some of those applications reuse only the basic connection parameters (e.g. host, user, port), dropping others.  If this drops a security-relevant parameter (e.g. channel_binding, sslmode, requirepeer, gssencmode), the attacker has an otherwise-unavailable opportunity to complete a man-in-the-middle attack or observe cleartext transmission.  Affected applications are clusterdb, pg_dump, pg_restore, psql, reindexdb, and vacuumdb.  The vulnerability arises only if one invokes an affected client application with a connection string containing a security-relevant parameter.  Supported, Vulnerable Versions: 9.5 - 13.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-04 09:00:59 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Peter Eisentraut   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c10)  msiddiqu    2020-11-12 15:19:47 UTC  ``` Created mingw-postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897234](show_bug.cgi?id=1897234 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25694 mingw-postgresql: postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897231](show_bug.cgi?id=1897231 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25694 postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:10/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897222](show_bug.cgi?id=1897222 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25694 postgresql:10/postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:11/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897228](show_bug.cgi?id=1897228 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25694 postgresql:11/postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:12/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897225](show_bug.cgi?id=1897225 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25694 postgresql:12/postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:9.6/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897219](show_bug.cgi?id=1897219 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25694 postgresql:9.6/postgresql: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c13)  Stoyan Nikolov    2020-11-17 08:06:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  In Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, PostgreSQL (embedded in rhevm-dependencies) was shipped as a part of Red Hat Gluster Storage Console that is no longer supported for use with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.5. Red Hat Gluster Storage Web Administration is now the recommended monitoring tool for Red Hat Storage Gluster clusters. In Red Hat Virtualization the manager appliance uses a vulnerable version of postgresql. Once a fix has been shipped for RHEL 8 the appliance can consume the fix via a regular yum update.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c14)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-11-17 08:17:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-131-125-1110-1015-9620-and-9524-released-2111/>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c15)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-11-17 09:39:44 UTC  ``` Upstream fixes: <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=85c54287af56fe351b53913ea2b81e9d6145f964> <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=8e5793ab60bba65ffaa0f2237b39c9580d8972c7> <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=a45bc8a4f6495072bc48ad40a5aa0304979114f7>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-02 10:36:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2020:5316 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5316](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5316)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-02 10:39:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2020:5317 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5317](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5317)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-14 12:55:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:5401 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5401](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5401)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1894423#c22)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-12-14 18:47:17 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Security Information

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) takes security seriously. This
allows our users to place their trust in PostgreSQL for protecting their
mission-critical data.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group follows a model that shares
responsibility between PostgreSQL itself and its deployment environment,
including hardware, operating system, and the application layer
(programming language, frameworks and client libraries). The PostgreSQL
documentation provides info on the inherent security features of PostgreSQL
and how to securely configure and run PostgreSQL.

Security vulnerabilities can exist both in PostgreSQL and software within the
PostgreSQL ecosystem, including client libraries, extensions, installers,
and other utilities. This page walks through what is considered a security
vulnerability in PostgreSQL, how to report PostgreSQL security
vulnerabilities, and how fixes for security vulnerabilities are released.

Please note that the PostgreSQL Project does not offer bug bounties.

## CVE Numbering Authority

The PostgreSQL Project is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), working with Red Hat
as our CNA Root. This allows us to assign our own CVE numbers and publish CVE
records for PostgreSQL and closely related projects.

We will currently assign CVE numbers for the following projects upon request to
cna@postgresql.org:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL RPM packaging](https://yum.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL DEB packaging](https://apt.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL Windows/macOS installers (EDB)](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-installers)
* [pgJDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)
* [psqlODBC](https://odbc.postgresql.org/)
* [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

Additional projects may request inclusion on the list above by emailing
cna@postgresql.org.

**NOTE:** The security team will only assign CVEs to projects
when requested by members of the project. If you think you've found a security
issue in a project other than PostgreSQL or it's packages and installers,
please contact the security team for that project. See below for more details.

## What is a Security Vulnerability in PostgreSQL?

A security vulnerability in PostgreSQL is an issue that allows a user to gain
access to privileges or data that they do not have permission to use, or
allows a user to execute arbitrary code through a PostgreSQL process.

The PostgreSQL Security Team does not consider reports on actions a PostgreSQL
superuser takes to be a security vulnerability. However, a report on an
unprivileged user escalating to superuser generally qualifies as valid.

The PostgreSQL Security Team typically does not consider a denial-of-service
on a PostgreSQL server from an authenticated, valid SQL statement to be a
security vulnerability. A denial-of-service issue of this nature could still
be a [bug](/account/submitbug/), and we encourage you to report it
on the [Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

Please do not report the lack of DMARC on postgresql.org mailing lists. This
is by design.

## Reporting a PostgreSQL Security Vulnerability

For security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL or any of the installers linked
from the [PostgreSQL download page](/download/), please email
security@postgresql.org.

For reporting non-security bugs, please visit the
[Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

If you are unsure if an issue is a security vulnerability, please err on the
side of caution and email
security@postgresql.org.

## Reporting non-PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

Please see below for how you can report security vulnerabilities in
PostgreSQL-related projects:

* For security vulnerabilities in the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org),
  please email
  pgsql-jdbc-security@lists.postgresql.org.
* For security vulnerabilities in [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/),
  please email security@pgadmin.org.
* If you wish to report a security vulnerability for any other open source project in
  the PostgreSQL ecosystem (e.g. a driver, an extension, or an installer) and
  need a secure communication channel, please email
  security@postgresql.org.

## PostgreSQL Security Releases

The PostgreSQL Project releases security fixes as part of
[minor version updates](/support/versioning/). You are always
advised to use the latest minor version available, as it will contain other
non-security related fixes.

A new PostgreSQL major release, which contains new features, has every prior
security fix.

If you find a security vulnerability in PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL Security
Team will credit you in the release notes and register a CVE for the
vulnerability. **Please do not register a CVE independently of the
PostgreSQL Security Team**.

## PostgreSQL Security Notifications

To receive notifications about security releases or other security
related news, you can subscribe to
the [pgsql-announce](/list/) mailing list. If you set your
subscription to only include the tag *Security*, it will
exclude all other announcements that are sent to this list.

## Known PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group believes that accuracy, completeness
and availability of security information is essential for our users. We choose
to pool all information on this one page, allowing easy searching for security
vulnerabilities over a range of criteria. This includes:

* Which major versions a security vulnerability is present in
* Which minor version update releases a security vulnerability is fixed in
* Whether an exploit requires a valid login
* CVSS score

You can find more detailed information about a security vulnerability by
clicking on the links in the table below.
