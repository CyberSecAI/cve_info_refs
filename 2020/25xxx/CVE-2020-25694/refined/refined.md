Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25694:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL client applications handle reconnections. Some applications reuse only basic connection parameters (host, user, port) and drop security-related parameters like encryption settings (e.g., `sslmode`, `requirepeer`, `gssencmode`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Downgraded Connection Security:** When a client application creates additional database connections, it might not reapply security-relevant parameters from the original connection string. This leads to a downgrade of connection security.
- **Information Disclosure:** The lack of encryption (due to dropped parameters) can expose sensitive data transmitted over the network, allowing for eavesdropping.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can exploit the downgraded security to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, intercepting and potentially modifying communications between the client and the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can observe cleartext transmissions, gaining access to sensitive data.
- **Data Integrity Compromise:** Attackers can modify data in transit during a MitM attack.
- **System Availability:** The vulnerability description in Red Hat bugzilla mentioned impact on "system availability", but this is less clear how this would manifest.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Level:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker positioned on the network path between a vulnerable client application and a PostgreSQL server.
- **Specific Client Applications:**  Vulnerable client applications include `clusterdb`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql`, `reindexdb`, and `vacuumdb`, invoked with a connection string containing a security-relevant parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the PostgreSQL client and server.
- **Vulnerable Client Invocation:** The attacker's opportunity arises when a vulnerable client application is invoked using a connection string with security relevant parameters.
- **No User Authentication Bypass:** Exploitation relies on a client application's behavior after a successful user authentication, not a bypass.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- **Affected Versions:** PostgreSQL versions 9.5 to 13.0 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in PostgreSQL versions 9.5.24, 9.6.20, 10.15, 11.10, 12.5, and 13.1.
