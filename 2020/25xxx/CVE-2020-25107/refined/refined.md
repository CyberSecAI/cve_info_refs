  "description": "The function in Nut/Net that processes DNS questions/responses has several issues: there is no check on whether a domain name is NULL-terminated; the DNS response data length is not checked (can be set to arbitrary value from a packet); the number of DNS queries/responses (set in DNS header) is not checked against the data present; the length byte of a domain name in a DNS query/response is not checked and is used for internal memory operations.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation when processing DNS queries and responses in Nut/Net. Specifically, there are no checks for null termination of domain names, validation of DNS response data length against the packet size, verification of the number of DNS queries/responses against the data, and checking of the length byte of a domain name before using it in memory operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending crafted DNS packets to a vulnerable device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted network packets to the vulnerable device. No special privileges are needed."
