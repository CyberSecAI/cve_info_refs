Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw in the `ports` component of the Observium application. Specifically, the `ports.inc.php` file includes another file based on a user-controlled `format` parameter without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary local file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes files specified by the user-supplied `format` parameter. The application doesn't sanitize this input, allowing attackers to include arbitrary local files.
*   **Unrestricted File Loading:** The vulnerability allows loading any file with `.inc.php` extension.
*   **Path Traversal:**  Attackers can use ".." sequences to traverse up the directory tree, allowing access to files outside of the intended webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, and database credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not direct, the attacker could potentially achieve RCE if they can include a PHP file containing malicious code or any php file which is controllable from the outside (e.g.: log file).
*   **Further Attack Vectors:** The LFI vulnerability could serve as a stepping stone for further attacks by giving attackers additional information about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/ports/` endpoint.
*   **`format` Parameter:** The `format` parameter within the query string is manipulated to include a path to a malicious or sensitive local file, which will then be processed by the include statement.
    *Example:*  `GET /ports/?format=../../../includes/polling/wmi HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Users:** Although the vulnerability exists within an authenticated page, the report does not mention authentication is necessary for exploitation.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `/var/opt/observium/html/pages/ports.inc.php` at line 355:
    ```php
    include($config['html_dir'].'/pages/ports/'.$vars['format'].'.inc.php');
    ```
*   The `$vars['format']` variable is directly used in the include statement, making it vulnerable to LFI.
*   The example shows the inclusion of `/var/opt/observium/includes/pooling/wmi.inc.php`, which should not be reachable from the webroot, via path traversal.
*   The server response shows the content of the included file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical description of CVEs, including specific code locations and a sample HTTP request.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mariusz Pop≈Çawski from AFINE.com.
*   The affected versions are Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631.
