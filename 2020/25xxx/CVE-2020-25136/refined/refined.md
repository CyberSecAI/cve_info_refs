Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25136

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `device/proto` component of the application. Specifically, the application allows the inclusion of arbitrary `.inc.php` files through the `proto` parameter in a GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where the application can be tricked into including local files, including those outside of the intended web root directory. The code snippet `include($config['html_dir']."/pages/device/routing/".$vars['proto'].".inc.php");` illustrates how the `$vars['proto']` parameter is directly used in an include statement without validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can include any file with the `.inc.php` extension, even those outside the web root directory, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration files or code.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the vulnerability directly allows local file inclusion, this can be leveraged for RCE. By including a file containing malicious PHP code, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `/device/device` endpoint with a modified `proto` parameter.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can use directory traversal techniques (e.g., `../../../../`) within the `proto` parameter to navigate to files outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application. The provided description specifies "Remote - authenticated users" as the attack type.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.

**Additional Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable code is located in `/var/opt/observium/html/pages/device/routing.inc.php` on line 53: `include($config['html_dir']."/pages/device/routing/".$vars['proto'].".inc.php");`
* The example request demonstrating the vulnerability is: `GET /device/device=345/?tab=routing&proto=../../../../includes/polling/wmi HTTP/1.1`.
*   The vulnerability is present in Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community version 20.8.10631.
