Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper escaping of a custom field's name when displayed in `bug_actiongroup_page.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- HTML Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the `bug_actiongroup_page.php` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML injection can lead to various issues including, but not limited to:
    - Displaying malicious content to users.
    - Potential phishing attacks or session hijacking through JavaScript execution.
    - Defacement of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user with administrative access can create a custom field with a crafted name containing HTML elements, which are not properly escaped when rendered by the system.
- The custom field is then used when updating issues with the "Update" action on `view_all_bug_page.php`, which then triggers the vulnerability when displaying the page `bug_actiongroup_page.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges in MantisBT to create custom fields and link it to a project.
- The attacker needs to have a way to select issues from the `view_all_bug_page.php` to trigger the `bug_actiongroup_page.php`
- No special network position is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `bug_actiongroup_page.php`
- The vulnerable line was:
  ```php
  $t_question_title = sprintf( lang_get( 'actiongroup_menu_update_field' ), lang_get_defaulted( $t_custom_field_def['name'] ) );
  ```
- The fix was to escape the custom field name using `string_attribute` before displaying it:
  ```php
  $t_question_title = sprintf( lang_get( 'actiongroup_menu_update_field' ),
  string_attribute( lang_get_defaulted( $t_custom_field_def['name'] ) )
  );
  ```
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.24.3.
