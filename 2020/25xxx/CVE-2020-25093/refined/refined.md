The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25093.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple PHP files within the "Ecommerce-CodeIgniter-Bootstrap" project. Specifically, the code was directly outputting POST and GET parameters without escaping special characters, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to missing output sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application by manipulating input fields or URL parameters. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Defacing the website
*   Stealing sensitive user information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user input fields (forms) and URL parameters (GET requests) that are not sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious code into user-controlled input fields or manipulate URL parameters. This typically requires the attacker to be able to interact with the application's forms or send specially crafted requests to the web server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

The code changes show that the fix was to use the `htmlspecialchars()` function to sanitize the user inputs before displaying them on the web page, preventing XSS attacks. The commit message "xss fixes" and the code changes themselves strongly indicate this as the vulnerability being addressed.
