      "content_type": "exploit-db",
      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the email field during login.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the login page (login.php or LoginAsAdmin.php) with a crafted SQL payload in the email field."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable login pages of the application.",
      "technical_details": "The attacker injects the SQL payload `' or 1=1 -- -` into the email field during the login process. Due to a lack of proper input sanitization, the injected SQL code alters the query logic, causing the application to authenticate the attacker regardless of the password entered. The injection can be performed in both login.php and LoginAsAdmin.php pages."
