Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Observable timing discrepancy in the implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a side-channel attack due to a timing discrepancy in the execution of ECC operations.
- The vulnerable algorithms include Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), Elliptic Curve Schnorr (EC SCHNORR) and Elliptic Curve Direct Anonymous Attestation (ECDAA).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially extract the ECC private key from the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the Nuvoton Trusted Platform Module NPCT75x (versions 7.2.0.1, 7.2.0.2, and 7.2.1.0).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical presence to carry out the side-channel attack.
- Ability to observe and measure timing differences during cryptographic operations on the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2020-25082.
- The affected product is Nuvoton's NPCT75x Trusted Platform Module with firmware versions 7.2.0.1, 7.2.0.2 and 7.2.1.0.
- A fixed firmware version 7.2.2.0 addresses the issue.
- The severity is rated as medium.
- This advisory is linked to research presented at http://tpm.fail and researchers from Masaryk University.
- The attack type is categorized as physical.
