{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Hyland OnBase web login process does not use a CSRF token.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on the login page. Lack of CSRF token during login.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can authenticate a victim using known credentials. This allows the attacker to gather user data, perform spoofing, and potentially execute other malicious activities by leveraging XSS vulnerabilities to extract data remotely.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, can perform actions on behalf of the attacker.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know valid user credentials, such as default credentials, and needs to induce the user to trigger the malicious request."
