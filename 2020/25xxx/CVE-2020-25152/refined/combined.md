## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update A part 1 of 1 ---------**

B. Braun has released software updates to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities:

**Within the United States and Canada:**

Battery pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 028U00093 (SN 138852 and lower).

Battery pack SP with Wi-Fi, software 054U00093 (SN 138853 and higher).

For more information, see the [B. Braun’s Vulnerability Advisory](https://www.bbraun.com/en/products-and-solutions/temp/b--braun-coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure/security-advisory.html).

**--------- End Update A part 1 of 1 ---------**

In addition, B. Braun recommends users of the affected products consider the following best practices:

* All facilities utilizing SpaceCom 2, and Battery Pack SP with Wi-Fi should review their IT infrastructure to ensure a network zone concept has been implemented whereby critical systems, such as infusion pumps, are housed in separate (e.g., by firewalls or VLAN) environments that are not accessible directly from the Internet or by unauthorized users.
* Wireless networks should be implemented using industry standard encryption and should be equipped with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and/or intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely. These vulnerabilities have a low attack complexity.
