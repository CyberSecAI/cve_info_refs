Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25776

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the iTISPlugin module of Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac. It stems from the improper handling of symbolic links, which allows an attacker to manipulate file permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability:** The software is susceptible to symbolic link attacks, where a malicious user can create a symbolic link to a protected file or directory and trick the vulnerable application into performing operations on the target by accessing the symlink.
*   **Improper Permission Handling:** The product does not properly validate operations against the symbolic links which leads to potential permission issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the symbolic link vulnerability, a local attacker can elevate their privileges to root.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.
*   **File Permission Modification:** An attacker can modify permissions of files within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker must create a malicious symbolic link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the target machine.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to run a program or script on the target system, to set up the symbolic link.
