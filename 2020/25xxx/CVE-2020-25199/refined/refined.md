The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in WECON LeviStudioU, including CVE-2020-25199.

**CVE-2020-25199:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing project files.
*   **Weaknesses:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code under the privileges of the application. This could lead to full compromise of the system running the software.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Opening a specially crafted project file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires a user to open a malicious project file, meaning the attacker needs to trick the user into doing so. The attack vector is local, meaning the malicious file needs to be delivered to the system through other means (e.g. USB drive, email, etc.).  A low skill level is needed for exploitation.

The document also mentions other vulnerabilities:
* **CVE-2020-16243**: Stack-based buffer overflow when processing project files.
