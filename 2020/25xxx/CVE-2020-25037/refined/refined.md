Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities, focusing on the identified CVEs:

**CVE-2020-25037**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper filtering of arguments passed to the `host` command in the Ucopia CLI.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Arbitrary command execution:** By injecting a crafted parameter (`-t \&data/test.sh`) into the `host` command, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell scripts that were previously uploaded via `scp`.
    *   **Unrestricted file upload:** The `scp` command preserves file permissions allowing an attacker to upload executable scripts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the system by executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the CLI user (admin).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user.
    *   The attacker must use the `host` command, with crafted parameters, to execute an uploaded file.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Authenticated access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user. This is facilitated by the default, unchanged CLI password and knowledge of CVE-2017-17743.

**CVE-2020-25036**

*   **Root Cause:** Unprotected command execution within the `less` pager, which is accessible via the `showDhcpLeases` command.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The `less` pager allows execution of shell commands via the `!` operator.
    *   **Unrestricted Shell Access:** The attacker can escape the restricted Ucopia CLI and gain access to a restricted shell (`rbash`).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Escalation from the restricted Ucopia CLI to a restricted shell.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  The attacker must have access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user.
    *  The attacker must use the `showDhcpLeases` command, and then execute `less` and the `!` operator to run commands, resulting in a restricted shell.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Authenticated access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user.

**CVE-2020-25035**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in `chroothole_client` which allows executing arbitrary php code with root privileges via a crafted call through the chroot.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** The `chroothole_client` allows execution of php code by passing arbitrary file path to the php interpreter.
    *   **Root privileges:** The php interpreter is run as root which leads to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete compromise of the system due to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user.
    *   The attacker must upload a malicious PHP file through `scp`.
    *   The attacker must then use `chroothole_client` with the path to the uploaded php file as a parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Authenticated access to the Ucopia CLI as the `admin` user.

**Summary of Exploitation Chain:**

1.  **Initial Access:** Leveraging the default `admin` CLI password (CVE-2017-17743), the attacker logs into the restricted CLI.
2.  **File Upload:** The attacker uses `scp` to upload a shell script or a php script.
3.  **Code Execution:**
    *   **CVE-2020-25037:**  Execute the uploaded shell script by using the vulnerability in the `host` command.
    *    **CVE-2020-25036:** Escape to `rbash` via `showDhcpLeases` and `less`.
    *  **CVE-2020-25035**: Use the `chroothole_client` to execute the uploaded php file with root privileges.
4. **Root Access:** By exploiting CVE-2020-25035, the attacker gains root privileges.

The blog post also describes failed attempts at exploitation (e.g. via `less`'s command execution, `host` command parameter injection), providing useful context.  The post emphasizes the danger of running php as root and the importance of proper user input validation. The content provides more information than the official CVE description.
