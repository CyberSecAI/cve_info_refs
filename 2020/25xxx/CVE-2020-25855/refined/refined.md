{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AES_UnWRAP()` function due to a missing bounds check on the size of the data being copied into a local buffer during AES unwrapping operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on WPA2 clients using the vulnerable Wi-Fi module, leading to complete compromise of the device. Alternatively, a denial-of-service can be triggered by overwriting the return address of functions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the vulnerable function during the WPA2 4-way handshake process, specifically while decrypting the key data.",
     "An attacker needs to know the PSK of the network the victim is connected to"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in the proximity of the target and have knowledge of the networkâ€™s Pre-Shared Key (PSK). They must also be able to capture or manipulate EAPOL packets during the WPA2 handshake process. They may create a malicious access point with the same SSID as the target network to force the target to connect to it and perform the exploit."
