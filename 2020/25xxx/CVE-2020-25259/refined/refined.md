{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hyland OnBase relies heavily on client-side validation, leading to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities on the server-side.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure deserialization using ASP.NET's BinaryFormatter.Deserialize which allows direct bytecode injection through SOAP messages.",
    "Insecure XML deserialization using several XML deserialization libraries.",
    "Insecure JSON deserialization."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the OnBase server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending crafted SOAP messages containing malicious bytecode.",
    "Exploiting insecure XML deserialization vulnerabilities.",
     "Exploiting insecure JSON deserialization vulnerabilities."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send crafted payloads to the OnBase server. No authentication or user interaction is required."
