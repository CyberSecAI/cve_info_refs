RAUC controls the update process on embedded Linux systems. It is both a target
application that runs as an update client and a host/target tool
that allows you to create, inspect and modify update files ("*bundles*").

### Usage

Please see the [documentation](https://rauc.readthedocs.org/) for
details.

### Prerequisites

#### Host (Build) Prerequisites

* build-essential
* meson
* libtool
* libdbus-1-dev
* libglib2.0-dev
* libcurl3-dev
* libssl-dev

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential meson libtool libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libcurl3-dev libssl-dev

```

For HTTP(S) streaming support, you also need netlink protocol headers:

```
sudo apt-get install libnl-genl-3-dev

```

If you intend to use json-support you also need

```
sudo apt-get install libjson-glib-dev

```

#### Target Prerequisites

Required kernel options (either `y` or `m`):

* `CONFIG_MD`
* `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM`
* `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP`
* `CONFIG_DM_VERITY`
* `CONFIG_SQUASHFS`
* `CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256`
* `CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NBD` (for streaming support)
* `CONFIG_DM_CRYPT` (for encryption support)
* `CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES` (for encryption support)

For using tar archive in RAUC bundles with Busybox tar, you have to enable the
following Busybox feature:

* `CONFIG_FEATURE_TAR_AUTODETECT=y`
* `CONFIG_FEATURE_TAR_LONG_OPTIONS=y`

Depending on the actual storage type and/or filesystem used, further target
tools might be required.
The documentation chapter
[Required Target Tools](http://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration.html#required-target-tools)
gives a more detailed list on these.

### Building from Sources

Note

RAUC is intended to be built both as a host tool as well as a target
tool (service). Therefore it is fully prepared for cross-compilation with meson.

```
git clone https://github.com/rauc/rauc
cd rauc
meson setup build
meson compile -C build # or 'ninja -C build' on meson < 0.54.0

```

### Manual Installation

Note

To prepare RAUC for the target device, it is highly recommended to
use an embedded Linux distribution build suite such as Yocto/OE, PTXdist or
Buildroot.

On the host system RAUC can be used directly from the build dir, or optionally
be installed. On the target instead, installing is highly recommended as it
also unpacks service and D-Bus configuration files required to run RAUC
properly:

```
meson install

```

### Running the Test Suite

```
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 time squashfs-tools python3-pytest python3-pydbus
# Optional to run all tests:
# sudo apt-get install faketime casync grub-common openssl softhsm2 opensc opensc-pkcs11 libengine-pkcs11-openssl mtd-utils
./qemu-test

```

### Creating a Bundle (Host)

Create a directory with the content that should be installed:

```
mkdir content-dir/
cp $SOURCE/rootfs.ext4 content-dir/

```

Create a manifest describing which image to install where together with some
meta info:

```
cat >> content-dir/manifest.raucm << EOF
[update]
compatible=FooCorp Super BarBazzer
version=2019.01-1
[image.rootfs]
filename=rootfs.ext4
EOF

```

Let RAUC create a bundle from this:

```
rauc --cert autobuilder.cert.pem --key autobuilder.key.pem bundle content-dir/ update-2019.01-1.raucb

```

### Starting the RAUC Service (Target)

Create a system configuration file in `/etc/rauc/system.conf` and start the
service process in background:

```
rauc service &

```

### Installing a Bundle (Target)

To install the bundle (from local storage) on your target device, run:

```
rauc install update-2023.02-1.raucb

```

To install a bundle from a webserver (using RAUC's built-in HTTP(S) streaming), run:

```
rauc install https://example.com/update-2023.02-1.raucb

```

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;

* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service.

# dm-verity[¶](#dm-verity "Permalink to this heading")

Device-Mapper’s “verity” target provides transparent integrity checking of
block devices using a cryptographic digest provided by the kernel crypto API.
This target is read-only.

## Construction Parameters[¶](#construction-parameters "Permalink to this heading")

```
<version> <dev> <hash_dev>
<data_block_size> <hash_block_size>
<num_data_blocks> <hash_start_block>
<algorithm> <digest> <salt>
[<#opt_params> <opt_params>]

```

<version>

This is the type of the on-disk hash format.

0 is the original format used in the Chromium OS.

The salt is appended when hashing, digests are stored continuously and
the rest of the block is padded with zeroes.

1 is the current format that should be used for new devices.

The salt is prepended when hashing and each digest is
padded with zeroes to the power of two.

<dev>

This is the device containing data, the integrity of which needs to be
checked. It may be specified as a path, like /dev/sdaX, or a device number,
<major>:<minor>.

<hash\_dev>

This is the device that supplies the hash tree data. It may be
specified similarly to the device path and may be the same device. If the
same device is used, the hash\_start should be outside the configured
dm-verity device.

<data\_block\_size>

The block size on a data device in bytes.
Each block corresponds to one digest on the hash device.

<hash\_block\_size>

The size of a hash block in bytes.

<num\_data\_blocks>

The number of data blocks on the data device. Additional blocks are
inaccessible. You can place hashes to the same partition as data, in this
case hashes are placed after <num\_data\_blocks>.

<hash\_start\_block>

This is the offset, in <hash\_block\_size>-blocks, from the start of hash\_dev
to the root block of the hash tree.

<algorithm>

The cryptographic hash algorithm used for this device. This should
be the name of the algorithm, like “sha1”.

<digest>

The hexadecimal encoding of the cryptographic hash of the root hash block
and the salt. This hash should be trusted as there is no other authenticity
beyond this point.

<salt>

The hexadecimal encoding of the salt value.

<#opt\_params>

Number of optional parameters. If there are no optional parameters,
the optional parameters section can be skipped or #opt\_params can be zero.
Otherwise #opt\_params is the number of following arguments.

Example of optional parameters section:

1 ignore\_corruption

ignore\_corruption

Log corrupted blocks, but allow read operations to proceed normally.

restart\_on\_corruption

Restart the system when a corrupted block is discovered. This option is
not compatible with ignore\_corruption and requires user space support to
avoid restart loops.

panic\_on\_corruption

Panic the device when a corrupted block is discovered. This option is
not compatible with ignore\_corruption and restart\_on\_corruption.

ignore\_zero\_blocks

Do not verify blocks that are expected to contain zeroes and always return
zeroes instead. This may be useful if the partition contains unused blocks
that are not guaranteed to contain zeroes.

use\_fec\_from\_device <fec\_dev>

Use forward error correction (FEC) to recover from corruption if hash
verification fails. Use encoding data from the specified device. This
may be the same device where data and hash blocks reside, in which case
fec\_start must be outside data and hash areas.

If the encoding data covers additional metadata, it must be accessible
on the hash device after the hash blocks.

Note: block sizes for data and hash devices must match. Also, if the
verity <dev> is encrypted the <fec\_dev> should be too.

fec\_roots <num>

Number of generator roots. This equals to the number of parity bytes in
the encoding data. For example, in RS(M, N) encoding, the number of roots
is M-N.

fec\_blocks <num>

The number of encoding data blocks on the FEC device. The block size for
the FEC device is <data\_block\_size>.

fec\_start <offset>

This is the offset, in <data\_block\_size> blocks, from the start of the
FEC device to the beginning of the encoding data.

check\_at\_most\_once

Verify data blocks only the first time they are read from the data device,
rather than every time. This reduces the overhead of dm-verity so that it
can be used on systems that are memory and/or CPU constrained. However, it
provides a reduced level of security because only offline tampering of the
data device’s content will be detected, not online tampering.

Hash blocks are still verified each time they are read from the hash device,
since verification of hash blocks is less performance critical than data
blocks, and a hash block will not be verified any more after all the data
blocks it covers have been verified anyway.

root\_hash\_sig\_key\_desc <key\_description>

This is the description of the USER\_KEY that the kernel will lookup to get
the pkcs7 signature of the roothash. The pkcs7 signature is used to validate
the root hash during the creation of the device mapper block device.
Verification of roothash depends on the config DM\_VERITY\_VERIFY\_ROOTHASH\_SIG
being set in the kernel. The signatures are checked against the builtin
trusted keyring by default, or the secondary trusted keyring if
DM\_VERITY\_VERIFY\_ROOTHASH\_SIG\_SECONDARY\_KEYRING is set. The secondary
trusted keyring includes by default the builtin trusted keyring, and it can
also gain new certificates at run time if they are signed by a certificate
already in the secondary trusted keyring.

try\_verify\_in\_tasklet

If verity hashes are in cache, verify data blocks in kernel tasklet instead
of workqueue. This option can reduce IO latency.

## Theory of operation[¶](#theory-of-operation "Permalink to this heading")

dm-verity is meant to be set up as part of a verified boot path. This
may be anything ranging from a boot using tboot or trustedgrub to just
booting from a known-good device (like a USB drive or CD).

When a dm-verity device is configured, it is expected that the caller
has been authenticated in some way (cryptographic signatures, etc).
After instantiation, all hashes will be verified on-demand during
disk access. If they cannot be verified up to the root node of the
tree, the root hash, then the I/O will fail. This should detect
tampering with any data on the device and the hash data.

Cryptographic hashes are used to assert the integrity of the device on a
per-block basis. This allows for a lightweight hash computation on first read
into the page cache. Block hashes are stored linearly, aligned to the nearest
block size.

If forward error correction (FEC) support is enabled any recovery of
corrupted data will be verified using the cryptographic hash of the
corresponding data. This is why combining error correction with
integrity checking is essential.

### Hash Tree[¶](#hash-tree "Permalink to this heading")

Each node in the tree is a cryptographic hash. If it is a leaf node, the hash
of some data block on disk is calculated. If it is an intermediary node,
the hash of a number of child nodes is calculated.

Each entry in the tree is a collection of neighboring nodes that fit in one
block. The number is determined based on block\_size and the size of the
selected cryptographic digest algorithm. The hashes are linearly-ordered in
this entry and any unaligned trailing space is ignored but included when
calculating the parent node.

The tree looks something like:

> alg = sha256, num\_blocks = 32768, block\_size = 4096

```
                            [   root    ]
                           /    . . .    \
                [entry_0]                 [entry_1]
               /  . . .  \                 . . .   \
    [entry_0_0]   . . .  [entry_0_127]    . . . .  [entry_1_127]
      / ... \             /   . . .  \             /           \
blk_0 ... blk_127  blk_16256   blk_16383      blk_32640 . . . blk_32767

```

## On-disk format[¶](#on-disk-format "Permalink to this heading")

The verity kernel code does not read the verity metadata on-disk header.
It only reads the hash blocks which directly follow the header.
It is expected that a user-space tool will verify the integrity of the
verity header.

Alternatively, the header can be omitted and the dmsetup parameters can
be passed via the kernel command-line in a rooted chain of trust where
the command-line is verified.

Directly following the header (and with sector number padded to the next hash
block boundary) are the hash blocks which are stored a depth at a time
(starting from the root), sorted in order of increasing index.

The full specification of kernel parameters and on-disk metadata format
is available at the cryptsetup project’s wiki page

> <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/DMVerity>

## Status[¶](#status "Permalink to this heading")

V (for Valid) is returned if every check performed so far was valid.
If any check failed, C (for Corruption) is returned.

## Example[¶](#example "Permalink to this heading")

Set up a device:

```
# dmsetup create vroot --readonly --table \
  "0 2097152 verity 1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 4096 4096 262144 1 sha256 "\
  "4392712ba01368efdf14b05c76f9e4df0d53664630b5d48632ed17a137f39076 "\
  "1234000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

```

A command line tool veritysetup is available to compute or verify
the hash tree or activate the kernel device. This is available from
the cryptsetup upstream repository <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/>
(as a libcryptsetup extension).

Create hash on the device:

```
# veritysetup format /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2
...
Root hash: 4392712ba01368efdf14b05c76f9e4df0d53664630b5d48632ed17a137f39076

```

Activate the device:

```
# veritysetup create vroot /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 \
  4392712ba01368efdf14b05c76f9e4df0d53664630b5d48632ed17a137f39076

### Description and Impact

A time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerability exists in the code that checks

and installs a firmware bundle.

When running "rauc install bundle.raucb" or using the 'Install/InstallBundle'

D-Bus methods, RAUC does the following:

1. check\_bundle() – verify the bundle signature via OpenSSL by opening it using

   the file name
2. mount\_bundle() – mount the bundle via a loopback device, re-opening it by

   file name
3. install the content of the bundle, possibly executing hook scripts

If the attacker is able to replace the bundle file between steps 1. and 2.,

RAUC will mount and install the modified bundle. Also, if the attacker is able

to modify the bundle file after step 2., they can modify the payload to be

installed or cause arbitrary hooks to be executed during the installation.

### Requirements for the Attack

This vulnerability requires the attacker to be able to replace or modify the

bundle file on disk, while RAUC is installing it (required privileges depend on

where the file is originally stored).

If an attacker has no write access to the location where bundles are installed

from and cannot trigger an installation, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.

Thus, if the rauc service is disabled (via the --disable-service option to

configure) and bundles are only installed by root from a safe location, the

vulnerability is not exploitable by other users.

If the system contains an update service accessible from the network and this

service stores the bundle to always the same location and does not deny uploads

while an installation is running, both vulnerabilities can be combined to a

remote attack. Note that the CGI example included with RAUC denies uploads

while an installation is running.

### Recommendation

If the attack is applicable to your system, you should update to RAUC version

1.5.

As part of preparing the update, verify that the new version is still able to

install further updates. More information on the migration process is available

in the Integration chapter under Bundle Format Migration (docs/integration.rst

in the source).

### Technical Background

While the vulnerability to replacing the bundle file could be fixed through

avoiding any re-opening of the bundle, this is not enough to protect against

concurrent modification of the mounted bundle file.

RAUC's original bundle format consists of a payload (a squashfs filesystem)

protected by a CMS signature. This means that the payload must be authenticated

as a whole before accessing it and any subsequent modification cannot be

detected.

As most systems using RAUC have little spare storage space, making a temporary

private copy of the to-be-installed bundle is not feasible. This means that

with the original bundle format the only possible mitigation is to ensure that

no concurrent modification by an attacker is possible.

### Solution

The solution implemented in RAUC version 1.5 consists of three parts:

A: opening the bundle file only once

B: protecting the bundle file against modification during installation

C: introducing a new bundle format

Part A solves the issue of re-opening the bundle after signature verification.

RAUC will now create the loop-back device directly from the open file

descriptor without using the losetup tool.

Part B protects against concurrent modification of the open bundle after

signature verification. This is done by taking ownership of the bundle file,

restricting write permissions and then checking for pre-existing open file

descriptors using the lease mechanism provided by the Linux kernel (fcntl with

F\_SETLEASE). Additionally, filesystems which could be provided by the attacker

(such as FUSE or NFS) are rejected.

With A and B, installations of bundles using the original ("plain") bundle

format are protected against the vulnerability.

As a longer-term solution, part C adds a new bundle format based on the

dm-verity [1] device mapper target. With this format, the payload is not

authenticated as a separate step, but directly by the kernel during every

payload access. This way, even bundles located on untrusted storage can be

safely installed. In the future, this will allow incrementally downloading a

bundle over the network, even with an untrusted connection or server.

RAUC automatically detects the bundle format and can be configured to reject

formats.

Until a fixed version is available in your build system, you may want to

integrate it yourself. For OpenEmbedded/Yocto, PTXdist and Buildroot, we have

prepared examples to help with the update to 1.5:

<https://github.com/rauc/rauc-1.5-integration>

If your system uses an unsupported version of OpenSSL (<1.1.1), a backport

patch is available in the rauc-1.5-integration repository above. Note that this

patch does not have the same breadth of testing as the 1.5 release.

![Vulnerability Discovered in RAUC Embedded Firmware Update Framework](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29124451/863_300-RAUC.jpg)

JFrog’s security research team (formerly Vdoo) are constantly researching leading embedded devices and their supply chain. As part of this research, we discovered CVE-2020-25860, a potentially critical vulnerability with CVSSv3 8.8 score in a Robust Auto-Update Controller ([RAUC](https://github.com/rauc/rauc)), an open-source framework for [firmware](https://www.vdoo.com/learn/what-is-firmware) updates. JFrog has responsibly disclosed this vulnerability and have worked closely with the vendor Pengutronix on verifying the fix to the vulnerability. Customers have been notified by Pengutronix that also published a [security advisory](https://github.com/rauc/rauc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgf3-h62j-w9vv) on the official GitHub repository. This vulnerability exists in all versions of RAUC until 1.5, which contains the patch.

The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use ([CWE-367](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html)) issue which allows an attacker with access to the firmware update file to overwrite it after it has been verified (but before installation is completed), which consequently allows installing an arbitrary firmware update, bypassing the cryptographic signature check mechanism.

## Effects of this vulnerability

As always with supply-chain vulnerabilities, it is difficult to estimate exactly how many devices are affected by it. This estimation is even more complex given that this is an open-source tool and it can be used by many different companies who have no relationship with the vendor. As such, Pengutronix can attest to its prevalence based on their customers, which they estimate at up to 100,000 devices in the field, but we believe the numbers are much higher as RAUC provides a core capability that most devices need. We have seen RAUC used in several different devices in multiple verticals such as industrial, smart buildings and medical. As we will elaborate below, this vulnerability also requires certain conditions in order to be exploited, especially remotely. We have seen these conditions met in at least one real-world device. However, currently, to the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability was not exploited in the field, and therefore, did not lead to any concrete privacy violation or security threat to anyone who uses RAUC.

## Background on RAUC

RAUC is a project that started in 2015 and was developed to be a lightweight tool that performs fail-safe secure image updates for Linux-based embedded devices.

RAUC allows embedded Linux developers to integrate a robust update client on their embedded device, with minimal effort and while avoiding writing any boilerplate update code. The RAUC framework supports many common bootloaders (U-Boot, grub, etc.)  and storage technologies (ext4, UBIFS, etc.) out of the box, and as such tries to be as close as possible to a “turnkey” solution for embedded device firmware updates.

RAUC’s key features are safety (atomic, fail-safe update operation), security (cryptographic signature checking) and customizability (adding user hooks in the installation process).

## Technical Deep-Dive

RAUC uses a bundle file as an archive that holds a new firmware. We found that during the firmware upgrade process this file can be replaced by an attacker (after the initial validation step) and by doing so a malicious firmware will be installed, effectively allowing the attacker to take control over the system.

When running `rauc install bundle.raucb` RAUC runs the following internal functions:

1. check\_bundle() – validates the bundle using an openssl library call
2. mount\_bundle() – mounts the bundle using a “mount” shell invocation

After these steps, the mounted bundle is extracted and overwrites the current firmware.

The critical issue is that once check\_bundle() finishes running, the bundle file is closed, and the verified data is not retained in any way.

When mount\_bundle() starts running, the mount shell invocation causes a re-read of the bundle data:

```
gboolean mount_bundle(RaucBundle *bundle, GError **error)
{
...
g_message("Mounting bundle '%s' to '%s'", bundle->path, mount_point);
res = r_mount_loop(bundle->path, mount_point, bundle->size,
...

gboolean r_mount_full(const gchar *source, const gchar *mountpoint, const gchar* type, goffset size, const gchar* extra_options, GError **error)
{
...
if (getuid() != 0) {
g_ptr_array_add(args, g_strdup("sudo"));
g_ptr_array_add(args, g_strdup("--non-interactive"));
}
g_ptr_array_add(args, g_strdup("mount"));
...
g_ptr_array_add(args, g_strdup(source));
...
sproc = r_subprocess_newv(args, G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_NONE, &ierror);
...

```

Consequently – an attacker can switch the bundle file between the calls check\_bundle() and mount\_bundle(). This lets the attacker deploy an arbitrary malicious firmware which essentially provides root privileges on the device:

![the attack flow](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29125244/1_the-attack-flow.png)

Figure 1: the attack flow, by the time the process reaches mount\_bundle() the attacker can replace the bundle file so RAUC will mount an unauthorized bundle

The chances of winning the race condition (replacing the bundle file between the check/mount bundle calls) are very high, since there is a non-negligible amount of code between the two operations including a shell invocation (the “mount” command), which is a very slow operation.

## Observed remote attack scenario

Although in most cases we believe the vulnerability will be exploitable as a local privilege escalation, we have observed a real-world scenario where the vulnerability was exploitable by a remote attacker, while leveraging a set of default hardcoded credentials.

The target device used a set of default hard coded credentials (username and password set to “admin”) which were not required to be changed on first login.

These credentials can be easily extracted by an attacker that has access to the device firmware, or guessed via a simple brute force attack.

Looking at the device’s attack surface:

1. The target device exposed an authenticated CGI endpoint `upload.cgi` which allowed arbitrary file upload to a hardcoded file path – `/tmp/rauc/bundle.raucb`
2. The target device exposed an authenticated CGI endpoint `install.cgi` which ran the hardcoded shell command `– rauc install /tmp/rauc/bundle.raucb`
3. There was no locking mechanism in place between the two CGI endpoints

In this case, an attacker can remotely take over the device, simple by invoking:

1. `upload.cgi` with a properly signed firmware
2. `install.cgi`
3. (very quickly) `upload.cgi` with a malicious firmware

![Observed remote attack scenario](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29125712/2_Observed-remote-attack-scenario.png)

## Local attack scenario and PoC

Assuming the local user has privileges for invoking RAUC (for example, through a sudo configuration that allows only the rauc command), but does not have the private key needed to sign a RAUC bundle, exploitation is trivial:

Copy a properly signed firmware to some path, for example: `./bundle.raucb`

Invoke RAUC – `sudo rauc install ./bundle.raucb`

Quickly replace `./bundle.raucb` with a malicious firmware

This scenario can also be exploited if the local user cannot invoke the RAUC command, assuming that the privileged user that invokes the RAUC command uses a path which the attacker can write to.

We have developed a proof-of-concept that takes advantage of this exact scenario:

1. The PoC accepts the full path to the bundle file to be replaced
2. The PoC waits for another user to run `rauc install` by monitoring a default directory (`/mnt/rauc`) that gets created after the verification step but before the mounting step
3. As soon as the verification is over (directory is created) the PoC overwrites the bundle file with arbitrary input

In a real attack scenario, the attacking bundle file could be moved over the properly signed bundle file (which is quicker than writing a new file in the correct location)

## As a device vendor, how do I know if my device is affected by this vulnerability?

You can check if your version of RAUC is vulnerable by running this command on your device

```
rauc --version

```

If the reported version is lower than 1.5, then your device contains the vulnerable code.

In practice, the device is only vulnerable if there is a possibility for a local or remote attacker to modify a bundle file while it is being installed.

This could happen, for example, in the following scenarios:

1. An unprivileged user can invoke the `rauc` command with root privileges, either through the sudo mechanism, setuid mechanism or any other proprietary mechanism. For example, the following line in the `/etc/sudoers` file would allow the “vdoo” user to invoke RAUC as root:

   `vdoo ALL=(root) /usr/bin/rauc`
2. `rauc install` is invoked at any time with a bundle path that can be modified by unprivileged users. For example:

   `/usr/bin/rauc install /tmp/mybundle.raucb`

   Since /tmp is world-writable by default, usually any user can modify the files under it.

## As an asset owner, how do I know if any of my deployed devices are vulnerable?

Unfortunately, it seems hard to tell if this vulnerability exists and more importantly, applicable just with network tools or without actually looking at the device code.

Having said that, if your device vendor does provide a software bill of materials (SBOM) for the device, please look for whether RAUC is used and if so you are most likely vulnerable (unless the version is listed explicitly as 1.5) in theory as the vulnerable code is present.

This doesn’t mean that the vulnerability is exploitable though (see more details above). If the device vendor doesn’t provide a software bill of materials (SBOM), we believe you should ask it to provide one as well their explicit response on the applicability of this vulnerability.

## How do I upgrade RAUC?

Use this link for examples on integration of RAUC version 1.5 into existing projects based on Yocto/OE, ptxdist and buildroot –

<https://github.com/rauc/rauc-1.5-integration/>

You can also compile the latest version of RAUC by following these instructions:

<https://github.com/RAUC/RAUC#building-from-sources>

## How to mitigate the risk if upgrading RAUC is not possible?

As mentioned above, this is a classic Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use vulnerability, where the attack leverages a non-atomic action that involves a check of the resource and usage of the resource. In this case the check is the signature check and the usage is the mount/upgrade operation.

The attack can be mitigated by making sure the installation is atomic and happens from a secure path.

Before running `rauc install`, copy the bundle file from the world-writable location to a secure location (root-writable only) and run the installation from that path. Use the existence of the secure location as a locking mechanism. This will ensure no unprivileged users (either local or remote) can meddle in the installation process.

This can be done with this example shell script:

```
# Assuming firmware is uploaded to /tmp/uploads/bundle.bin
# Assuming /data/fw_upgrade can be written to only by root
if [ ! -e /data/fw_upgrade/bundle.bin ]; then
cp /tmp/uploads/bundle.bin /data/fw_upgrade/bundle.bin
/usr/bin/rauc install /data/fw_upgrade/bundle.bin
rm /data/fw_upgrade/bundle.bin
fi

```

Please note that changing an installation script may not be significantly easier than switching to a fixed RAUC version when using a build system like Yocto. Please see below for details on how to upgrade. For more mitigation details, we refer you back to the [official advisory](https://github.com/rauc/rauc/security/advisories/GHSA-cgf3-h62j-w9vv).
