Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the file upload mechanism of Typesetter CMS version 5.1. Specifically, the CMS fails to properly restrict the upload of malicious PHP files when they are contained within a ZIP archive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper file type validation, allowing an attacker to upload a ZIP archive containing a PHP file, despite direct PHP uploads being blocked.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system does not properly sanitize or validate the contents of uploaded ZIP files, leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target operating system via a malicious PHP webshell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Typesetter CMS, specifically the file upload functionality within the admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative privileges to access the file upload functionality within the CMS.
- **Knowledge of Upload Mechanism:** The attacker needs to know the bypass method of uploading a malicious php file by putting it inside a zip file.
- **Malicious PHP File:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PHP file (webshell) to upload.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The Typesetter CMS version 5.1 is vulnerable to a file upload bypass which leads to command execution. An attacker with admin access can upload a zip file containing a php file. When extracted and opened, the PHP file allows arbitrary code to be executed on the system.
