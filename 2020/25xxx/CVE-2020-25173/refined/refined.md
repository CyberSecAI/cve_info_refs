The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25173.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Reolink P2P protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321).
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319), although this is related to CVE-2020-25169.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information
- Potential for further compromise of Reolink P2P cameras, including access outside the local network.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local network access is required to obtain the fixed cryptographic key.
- An attacker with network access can leverage the exposed key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local network access to the affected Reolink devices.
- Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The document also discusses CVE-2020-25169 which is related to cleartext transmission of sensitive information, although the main focus of the provided content is the hardcoded key which is associated to CVE-2020-25173
- The affected products are Reolink devices that use the P2P protocol, including RLC-4XX, RLC-5XX, and RLN-X10 series.
- Mitigation includes disabling P2P feature and upgrading the firmware.
