- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The protection of user-defined functions (UDFs) in LOGO! program files is implemented in the software that displays the information, not in the file itself.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate protection of user-defined functions (UDFs) within LOGO! program files. The software relies on the display software for protection, rather than encrypting the UDFs within the file itself. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended password protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reverse engineer the user-defined functions (UDFs) directly from the stored program files, potentially gaining access to sensitive logic, algorithms or intellectual property implemented in the UDFs.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the LOGO! program files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the stored program files which are generated by the affected software components. The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction.
