Hello **Techie**,

Hope you are doing well, So today discussion is about well known bug i.e: Full Path disclosure.

Although, It is low/medium in severity depends upon attack vector (Looping this issue with another).

In Owasp TOP 10 category comes under

Vulnerability Category: **A6- Security Misconfiguration**

Without further delay, I am sharing well known bug which i got in one of well known product.

Let’s take site name as **redacted**.com, So normally we found full path in error message.

But the question is how we can get those ?

Here, **I achieved this error message by playing with sessions timeout features.**

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Login into product.

[http://redacted.co](https://www.redacted.com)m

2. Next, Once you login into product, Leave the session for more than 2 hours once server automatically terminate the current session.

3. After, Session terminate i got the error message like “session timeout” and also even with that internal path disclose where file reside.

![]()

It work for me, Hope in your case works too.

After this, submit to them and got the appreciation from them.

Rewards: Got appreciation and recommendation.

**Conclusion -**

“When an active session is closed due to timeout on user’s inactivity, the error message contain the path of connection component.”

Keep Hacking,

Viraj Mota

# Privileged Session Manager

|  | CyberArk may choose not to provide maintenance and support services for theCyberArk Privileged Session Manager with relation to any end-user client machine or target platforms which have reached their formal End-of-Life date, as published by their respective vendors from time to time. For more details, contact your CyberArk support representative. |
| --- | --- |

The Privileged Session Manager (PSM) is a CyberArk component that enables you to initiate, monitor, and record privileged sessions and usage of administrative and privileged accounts. The PSM does not require a dedicated machine. However, it must be installed on a machine that is accessible to the network.

|  | To achieve optimal concurrency it is recommended to install PSM on a dedicated machine. |
| --- | --- |

## Supported Operating Systems

PSM can be installed on the following platforms:

* Windows 2022
* Windows 2019

  |  | Due to RDS licensing enforcement in Windows 2019, a per-user license is no longer supported for local users. We recommend using a per-device RDS license.  To work with a per-user license on a Windows 2019 machine, PSM users must be moved to the domain level. See [PSMConnect and PSMAdminConnect Domain Users](../pas%20inst/optional-moving-the-psmconnec-and-psmadminconnect-users-to-your-domain.htm) for details. |
  | --- | --- |

## Software Requirements

* .NET Framework 4.8
* Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Session Host

  |  | Make sure you have the required number of RDS CALs to enable you to access the RDS server. For more information, refer to [Connect to the PSM server with Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Session Host](../pas%20inst/considerations-before-installing-psm.htm#_Ref332289750). |
  | --- | --- |

* Remote Desktop Gateway (optional)
* Before installing PSM, make sure that the Users group has the Allow Logon Locally Windows permission in the local security policy. This ensures that the PSMShadowUsers group created during PSM installation will have the required permissions. Alternatively, you can set this local security policy permission for the PSMShadowUsers group directly after PSM installation.
* PSM can be installed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platforms
* You must set the Windows locale on the PSM server to the correct location if you are using non-English characters.

## Minimum system requirements

The minimum requirements for the PSM are as follows:

| Platform: | 8 core processor (Intel compatible) |
| --- | --- |
| Disk space: | 80GB free disk space for installation, and additional 80GB space for temporary workspace |
| Minimum memory: | 8 GB |
| Communication: | TCP/IP connection to the Digital Vault Server |

## Requirements for end-user machines

| Required Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| RDP ActiveX Client | 5.2 or later for environments set up to use an ActiveX connection method for PSM connection) |
| CyberArk PSM codec | For viewing high compression session recordings with an external player (for example, Windows Media Player). The PSMCodec.exe is included in the PSM installation package and is required to enable users to view PSM recordings with a regular media player (not PSM Direct Playback). |
| JRE (Java Runtime Environment) | JRE 1.4, or later (for SSH transparent connections) |

## PSM supported connections

PSM supports connections to remote machines using IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with the following platforms out-of-the-box. Additional platforms can be supported and monitored using the PSM Universal Connector. For more information, see [Deploy PSM Connectors](../psm/psm_universalconnectors.htm).

| Platform | Additional Information |
| --- | --- |
| Unix, Linux and Network for any SSH-based devices | Support using the following protocols:   * SSH (including file-transfer capabilities)  * Telnet |
| Windows RDP (including file-transfer capabilities) | |  | * Connections to and from Windows 2003 and earlier Windows versions are not supported. * Target Windows servers must not enable the Always prompt for password policy setting. | | --- | --- | |
| Windows Remotely Anywhere |  |
| AS400 (iSeries) |  |
| OS/390 (Z/OS) |  |
| Web-based interfaces, client, and custom applications |  |
| PSM for Databases | PSM can monitor Oracle DBA sessions through the following DBA tools:   * Toad - Toad for Oracle offline edition v16.x 64bit is supported * SQL\*Plus - SQL\*Plus x64 12.2.0.0 is supported   PSM can monitor Microsoft SQL Server DBA sessions through the following DBA tools:   * SQL Server Management Studio 2008,2012, 2016, 16.x, and 17.x |
| PSM for Virtualization | PSM can monitor VMWare administration session through the following tools:   * vSphere Client to connect to vSphere / ESX hosts * vSphere Client to connect to vCenter   To monitor VMWare administrator sessions, install the following software on the PSM machine:   * vSphere Client v4.0, v4.1, v5.0, and v6.0   |  | vSphere Client does not work on a hardened machine. | | --- | --- | |

## Storage requirement for PSM recordings

The Privileged Session Manager stores the session recordings on the Digital Vault server or an external storage device. For details on storing recordings on an external device, see [External storage device](../pasimp/externalstorage.htm).

The estimated storage requirement is approximately 50-250 KB for each minute of a recording session. The recording size is affected by the type of session recording (console vs. GUI recording) as well as by the type and number of activities that are performed during the session. For details, see [Planning capacity](../pas%20inst/considerations-before-installing-psm.htm#_Ref465255572).

To more accurately establish a recording size for your session recordings, we recommend checking the size of an average session recording in your customer environment.

## CyberArk component compatibility

PSM is compatible with the following CyberArk components:

* Digital Vault server
* Password Vault Web Access
* Privileged Session Manager SSH Proxy
* CPM

Each version of PSM is compatible with all versions of these components that have not reached the [End of Development Date](https://docs.cyberark.com/Portal/Legal/en/Content/EndOfLifePolicy.htm#PrivilegedAccessSecurity) at the time the PSM version was released.

For example, PSM 11.6 was released in August 2020 and is compatible with version 10.5 and higher of these components, but PSM 11.5, which was released in June 2020, is compatible with version 10.4 and higher of these components.

## HTML5 Gateway

Hardware specifications

| Small + Mid-range implementation  (1-50 concurrent RDP/SSH sessions) | Mid-range + Large implementation  (51-100 concurrent RDP/SSH sessions) | Very large implementation  (101-200 concurrent RDP/SSH sessions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * 2 core processors (Intel compatible) * 4 GB RAM | * 4 core processors (Intel compatible) * 8 GB RAM | * 8 core processors (Intel compatible) * 16GB RAM |

|  | * Tests are based on 40% SSH and 60% RDP concurrent sessions running with full HD resolution. * These requirements are based on a dedicated machine for HTML5 Gateway. |
| --- | --- |

Files that are transferred during an HTML5 Gateway session are temporarily stored on the HTML5 Gateway machine, so the machine must have enough available storage space. For example, if there will be 20 sessions that transfer files at the same time, and each session will transfer at most 5GB, you need 100GB of available storage.

Software specifications

If you are installing the PSM Gateway using a container:

* Docker - Ubuntu 20.x or 22.x versions
* Podman - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x or 9.x versions, or RockyLinux 8.x versions

If you are installing the PSM Gateway using an RPM package:

* The PSM Gateway supports any Web service, such as Tomcat v 9, that can support Java 1.6 or later and that can support WAR files.

  |  | We recommend using Tomcat as your Web service. |
  | --- | --- |
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x and 9.x versions, and Rocky 8.x versions

  + Required libraries:

    - libpng
    - libjpeg-turbo
    - libcairo
    - OpenSSL v1.1.x
    - Java SDK
    - Initscripts

    The libraries must be installed with dnf:
