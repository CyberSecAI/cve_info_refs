Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25875 (though the description is a placeholder, the provided content matches the description on the CVE Details page for CVE-2020-25875 which states "Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Codoforum v5.0.2 allows attacker to execute arbitrary code via the 'Smileys' function.")

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization/encoding of user-supplied input when creating or editing "Smileys" within the Codoforum administrative panel. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode HTML entities, allowing a malicious user to inject and store a malicious payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper output encoding when rendering the smiley codes.  The application stores the user-provided payload without sanitizing it.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Although not explicitly stated, the provided details imply that the application does not properly validate the input being received for "Smiley Code".
*   **Improper HTML Entity Encoding:** The vulnerability exists because the application's removal of script tags is insufficient. It needs to encode HTML entities instead of only removing `<script>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who visit the page where the manipulated smiley is displayed.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker might steal session cookies, potentially leading to account compromise or control of administrative accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  The attacker could use the XSS to redirect users to malicious sites, spreading malware.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the forum's appearance, potentially damaging its reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Admin Panel:** The attack vector involves a malicious, authenticated user accessing the administration panel of Codoforum.
*   **Smiley Feature:**  The vulnerability is located in the "Smileys" feature, specifically when creating or editing a smiley.
*   **Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious payload into the 'Smiley Code' input field.
*  **Retrieval by Other Users:** The XSS vulnerability is triggered when another user visits a page displaying the manipulated smiley.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with access to the Codoforum admin panel.
*   **Admin Privilege:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to modify smileys via the admin panel.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft a malicious payload and understand XSS vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details from Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** The 'Smileys' feature within Codoforum V.5.0.2
*   **Specific Input Field:** 'Smiley Code' field when editing/creating a smiley.
*   **Payload Example:**  The report provides `'><details/open/ontoggle=confirm(1337)>` as a functional example payload.
*   **Exploitation Steps:** The exploit steps are provided: login into the admin panel, navigate to smiley editor, inject the payload, save, view the page where smiley is displayed and trigger the alert.
*  **Insufficient mitigation:** Removal of script tags is not sufficient to prevent the XSS attack.
