    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-25079",
      "root_cause": "The D-Link devices are vulnerable to two issues: command injection via the /cgi-bin/ddns_enc.cgi and unauthenticated admin password disclosure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authenticated Command injection",
        "Unauthenticated credential disclosure"
     ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device due to the command injection vulnerability. The unauthenticated admin password reveal allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The command injection is triggered by accessing the `/cgi-bin/ddns_enc.cgi` endpoint.",
	"The unauthenticated password disclosure is accessed via an unspecified vector"
      ],
     "required_capabilities": [
       "For command injection, the attacker requires authentication to the device.",
       "For password disclosure, no authentication is required."
