DCS-2530L, (non-US) DCS-2670L, (non-US) DCS-P703, and DCS-46xx/47xx/48xx Series:: Authenticated Command Injection and Unauthenticated Credential Disclosure

**Overview**

On June 11, 2020, a 3rd Party security researcher brought two (2) security-related events to D-Link's attention.  Two vulnerabilities were noticed on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com) about the DCS-2530L IP Camera. Upon investigation, D-Link noticed the (non-US) DCS-2670L IP Camera also was reported by some Twitter users.

D-Link has investigated and confirmed the security-related issues.

On August 28, 2020, a 3rd Party security research firm, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd, reported using this vulnerability could escalate exploit of additional cameras (non-US) DCS-P703, and DCS-46xx/47xx/48xx Series.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.
