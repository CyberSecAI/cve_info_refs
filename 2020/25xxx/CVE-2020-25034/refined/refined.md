- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing sanitization of user-controlled input in the web application when searching for processed emails.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89). Multiple SQL injection vectors were identified, primarily time-based blind injection. The most potent vector uses a UNION query via the "sort" parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to extract data from the underlying database due to the SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker can gain read access to the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted GET requests to the web GUI using the cookies for an active session with parameters such as "sort", "sort_by", "search[URL]", and "search[attachment]".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs authorized access to the web application with low-level privileges, such as "monitor", "analyst", "operator", or "admin". The "auditor" role does not have access to the vulnerable functionality.
