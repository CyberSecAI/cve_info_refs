  "CVE-2020-25212": {
    "Description": "A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability exists in the NFS client code in the Linux kernel before 5.8.3. A local attacker could exploit this issue to corrupt memory or have other unspecified impacts because a size check is in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c instead of fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c.",
    "Root cause": "The size check for security labels in the NFS client implementation was done in `fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c` instead of `fs/nfs/nfs4xdr.c`. This created a TOCTOU race condition, where a malicious local attacker could potentially modify the size after the check but before the actual memory copy, which would lead to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "TOCTOU vulnerability",
      "Incorrect bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash), memory corruption or possibly achieve arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to a system running a vulnerable kernel is required. The vulnerability is present in the NFS client implementation, so exploitation would likely involve interacting with a malicious NFS server (possibly a locally emulated server).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system, which is also a NFS client. They must be able to control the behavior of the NFS server (either a malicious server on the network or a locally emulated one). They need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path in the NFS client by sending specially crafted replies from the server which manipulate the size parameter."
