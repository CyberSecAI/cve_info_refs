| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1881409#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2020-09-22 11:22:29 UTC  ``` A null pointer dereference issue was found in the IDE disk emulator of QEMU. It could occur while cancelling an i/o operation via ide_cancel_dma_sync() routine, if a block drive pointer is null. A guest may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

Subject: QEMU: NULL pointer derefrence issues

   Hello,

1. CVE-2020-25741 QEMU: fdc: null pointer dereference during r/w data transfer

A null pointer dereference issue was found in the Floppy disk emulator of
QEMU. It could occur while transferring data via fdctrl_read_data(),
fdctrl_write_data() routines, if current drive has a null block pointer. A
guest may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS
scenario.

2. CVE-2020-25742 QEMU: scsi: lsi: null pointer dereference during memory move

A null pointer dereference issue was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus
Adapter emulator of QEMU. It could occur while processing 'Memory Move'
instructions to move data between dma memory and i/o address space via
lsi_memcpy(). A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process
resulting in DoS scenario.

3. CVE-2020-25743 QEMU: ide: null pointer dereference while cancelling i/o operation

A null pointer dereference issue was found in the IDE disk emulator of QEMU.
It could occur while cancelling an i/o operation via ide_cancel_dma_sync()
routine, if a block drive pointer is null. A guest may use this flaw to crash
the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

   -> <https://ruhr-uni-bochum.sciebo.de/s/NNWP2GfwzYKeKwE?path=%2Fide_nullptr1b>

* These issues were reported by Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann, Simon
   Wrner of Ruhr-University Bochum.

* CVE-2020-2574[123]? assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.
