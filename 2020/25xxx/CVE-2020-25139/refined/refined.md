Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it. Specifically, the `alert_test_id` parameter, which can be controlled by an attacker, is directly included in the output message within the `print_message` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the unsanitized user input directly in the HTML response. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks such as:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the victim.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting the victim to a malicious website.
    - **Information theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
    - **Malware distribution:** Serving malware to the victim.

**Attack vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `alert_test_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL and send it to a user. The user needs to be authenticated to the application.
- The attacker does not need to have direct access to the server; the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional technical details from the provided content:**

- **Vulnerable Code:** The `print_message` function in `alert_check.inc.php` (specifically line 119) is used to display the unsanitized `alert_test_id`.
- **Example Request:** The provided GET request demonstrates how to inject a malicious SVG tag with an `onload` event into the `alert_test_id` parameter. This tag executes the `alert(document.domain)` Javascript when the browser renders the HTML.
- **Affected Product:** The vulnerability affects Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631 and potentially earlier versions.
- **Affected Component:** The `alert_check` component, specifically the `delete_alert_checker` action, is vulnerable.
- **Mitigation Note:** The code snippet in the content does not perform any sanitization on the `alert_test_id` parameter.
