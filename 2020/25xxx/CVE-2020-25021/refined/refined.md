Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd()` method of the Noise-Java library. The method lacked sufficient boundary checks, specifically for the `plaintextOffset` and `length` parameters when copying data using `System.arraycopy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code did not properly validate the `plaintextOffset` and `length` parameters. Specifically, it did not verify that `plaintextOffset + length` was within the bounds of the `plaintext` array and that `plaintextOffset` was not negative.
*  **Bypassable Length Checks:** The initial check for `ciphertextOffset` being within bounds could be bypassed with a negative `ciphertextOffset` because the code would then incorrectly increase the available space rather than decreasing it.
*   **Out-of-bounds Access:** The use of `System.arraycopy` without proper bounds checking could lead to out-of-bounds read or write operations.
*   **Integer overflow:** Addition of `plaintextOffset + length` could result in an integer overflow, causing the check to pass when it should not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read/write:** If the JVM does not throw an exception, an attacker could read or write data outside the bounds of the allocated memory for the `plaintext` or `ciphertext` arrays.
*  **Information disclosure**: OOB read could lead to disclosure of sensitive data in memory.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some JVM implementations, such as the Avian JVM, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of service:** The vulnerability could lead to a crash or denial of service.
*   **Data loss**: OOB write could overwrite data leading to data loss.
*   **JVM Exception**: Depending on the underlying JVM implementation, the vulnerability could cause an exception to be thrown by the JVM instead of the intended `ShortBufferException`

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input to the `encryptWithAd` method with a large `plaintextOffset` or negative `ciphertextOffset` or negative `length`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to call the vulnerable `encryptWithAd` method and control the parameters to this method.
*   The attacker needs to know how to exploit the specific conditions of the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by improving boundary checks in the `AESGCMFallbackCipherState.java`, `AESGCMOnCtrCipherState.java` and `ChaChaPolyCipherState.java` files.
*   The fix involves validating the parameters before performing copy operations.
*   The provided commit diff shows the changes made to address the issues including a check for integer overflows when checking bounds.
