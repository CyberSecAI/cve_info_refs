Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within PI ProcessBook files when imported into PI Vision.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** A remote attacker with write access to PI ProcessBook files can inject malicious code that is then imported and executed within PI Vision.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive PI System data or other data accessible with the victim's user permissions.
*   **Modification of Data:** An attacker could modify PI System data or other data.
*   **Deletion of Data:** An attacker could delete PI System data or other data.
*   **Code Execution:** The injected code could potentially perform malicious actions on the victim's machine or within the application context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
*   **PI ProcessBook File Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code into PI ProcessBook files.
*   **Import by PI Vision:** The malicious code is then executed when PI Vision imports the compromised file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access to PI ProcessBook Files:** The attacker needs to have the ability to modify or create PI ProcessBook files.
*   **Low Skill Level to Exploit:** The document indicates a low skill level is needed to exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a victim to view or interact with the infected display in PI Vision.

**Additional details:**

*   The document also references CVE-2020-25167, an "Incorrect Authorization" vulnerability, but it is distinct from CVE-2020-25163 and is therefore not included in the above breakdown.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of PI Vision prior to PI Vision 2020.
*   The document includes CVSS v3 base score and vector for CVE-2020-25163: 7.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)

This content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, outlining the specific attack vector involving PI ProcessBook files and the specific consequences of exploiting the XSS vulnerability.
