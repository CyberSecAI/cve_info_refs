Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-25262:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to deletion of pages in PyroCMS.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the action to delete pages in PyroCMS is performed via a GET request, without proper CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to prevent forged requests.
*   **GET Request for Sensitive Action:**  Using a GET request for a state-changing operation like deleting pages is a bad practice and makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete pages from the PyroCMS site.
*   This can lead to data loss and disruption of the website's content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker would create a malicious HTML page with JavaScript that sends the delete request to the vulnerable PyroCMS site.
*   The attacker then tricks an authenticated administrator into visiting the malicious page via a link through social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a web page and host it on their server.
*   The attacker needs to entice the victim (an authenticated PyroCMS administrator) to visit the attacker-controlled web page while logged in to PyroCMS.
