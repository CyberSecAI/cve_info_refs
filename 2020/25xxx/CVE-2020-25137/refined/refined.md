Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `alert_check` component of the application. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode user-provided values for alert names and messages before displaying them in the HTML context of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code injected through user input is stored and then executed when the page is rendered. The application does not properly handle special characters in the "alert\_name" and "alert\_message" parameters, allowing the injection of `<svg onload=alert(1)>` payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By successfully injecting XSS payloads, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking, where the attacker steals a user's session cookies and takes control of their account.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could potentially steal sensitive data, such as user credentials or personal information.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could deface the application, displaying malicious content to users.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The XSS vulnerability can be used to distribute malware to the application's users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/alert_check/alert_test_id=6/` endpoint.
*   **Payload Injection:** Malicious JavaScript code is embedded within the "alert\_name" and "alert\_message" parameters of the POST request. For instance:
    ```
    alert_test_id=6&alert_name=xyz1231337%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%281%29%3E&alert_message=xyz1231338%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%282%29%3E&alert_delay=111&alert_send_recovery=1&alert_severity=crit&action=alert_details&requesttoken=d00602b321a321c97928d8d9cfe030f402b6c056fecedea31cd73639afee9d01
    ```
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected payload is stored and executed when the page displaying the alert information is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** Knowledge of the `/alert_check/` endpoint and the vulnerable parameters ("alert\_name", "alert\_message") is necessary.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP POST requests:** The attacker must be able to construct and send a POST request with the malicious payload.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not necessarily need any special privileges on the vulnerable system other than the ability to make HTTP requests, and potentially have a valid session to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Gist includes a detailed example of the vulnerable request and a partial server response, demonstrating how the XSS payload is reflected in the HTML output.
*   The Gist also identifies the affected product versions as Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631 of Observium, and the vulnerable component as `alert_check`.
* The discovered recommends mitigations based on OWASP guidelines, highlighting the lack of proper input validation and output encoding.
* The Gist notes the vulnerability was discovered by Mariusz Pop≈Çawski / AFINE.com team.
