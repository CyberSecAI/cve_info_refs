The content is related to CVE-2020-25705.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in ICMP packets within the Linux kernel, specifically regarding the use of insufficiently random values for UDP source port randomization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Insufficiently random values are used for UDP source port randomization in ICMP packets.
  - The vulnerability allows bypassing UDP source port randomization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Successful exploitation could compromise confidentiality and integrity by allowing an attacker to quickly scan open UDP ports on a target.
  - Software that relies on UDP source port randomization is indirectly affected.

**Attack vectors:**
  - The attack can be carried out remotely.
  - The attack is off-path, meaning the attacker does not need to be on the direct network path.
  - Exploitation is possible through the network layer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker does not require any privileges.
  - The attacker does not require any user interaction.
  - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted ICMP packets to the target.
