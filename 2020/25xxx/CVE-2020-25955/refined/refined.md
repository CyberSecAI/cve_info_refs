Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "student management system project" which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the system's database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means that malicious scripts injected by an attacker are permanently stored within the application's database and are executed when other users access that data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    -   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    -   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
    -   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    -   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website.
    -   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attacker injects the malicious script through the "Add subject tab," which is vulnerable to stored XSS.
- The injected script is then stored in the database.
- When other users edit or view the subject information, the stored malicious script is executed within their browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Add subject tab" and inject the malicious script.
-  No specific privilege level is mentioned; this suggests that even a regular user may have access to the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the "student management system project"
- The affected software is a PHP-based student management system.
- The vulnerability was tested on Windows 10 and Kali Linux.
