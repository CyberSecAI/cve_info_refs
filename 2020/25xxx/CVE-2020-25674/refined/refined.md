```
Root cause of vulnerability:
An improper exit condition in a for loop in `WriteOnePNGImage` allows an out-of-bounds read via heap-buffer-overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Out-of-bounds read

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service due to application crash
- Potential impact to system availability

Attack vectors:
- Processing a specially crafted PNG image file with a colormap that has less than 256 valid values.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted PNG image file to be processed by ImageMagick.
