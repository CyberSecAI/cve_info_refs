Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application, Nifty-PM, implemented insufficient input sanitization on the task module. While it attempted to filter out `<script>` tags, it did not properly handle HTML encoded payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Initially, the application exhibited reflected XSS when an attacker entered `<svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>`. The payload wasn't stored, but it did execute in the user's browser.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By HTML-encoding the payload to `&lt;svg/onload&equals;alert(document.cookie)&gt;`, the attacker was able to bypass the input filters. The application then stored this encoded payload in the task module. When the task was viewed, the browser decoded the HTML entities, leading to the execution of the malicious JavaScript code, thus resulting in stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the task module. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data displayed on the page or within the application.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the application for malicious purposes.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Task Input Field:** The primary attack vector was the input field within the task module where users could enter text.
*   **HTML Encoding Bypass:**  Attackers could circumvent the application's basic filtering by using HTML encoded payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Nifty-PM application to access the task module and inject malicious scripts.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTML Encoding:** The attacker must be aware of HTML encoding techniques to bypass the application's basic input sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched, and the content confirms the CVE ID as CVE-2020-25071.
* The blog post highlights the importance of thorough input validation and sanitization, and how encoding can be used to bypass basic filtering.
