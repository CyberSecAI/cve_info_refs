The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25087. This commit addresses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it in HTML, specifically in the `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability present is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Untrusted user input from POST and GET parameters is directly embedded into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed by other users visiting the site. This could lead to various impacts, including:

*   Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacing the website.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
*   Gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious URLs or POST requests that contain JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters (e.g., username, email, discount codes, blog content, etc.).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit data through HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This usually involves being able to access the application's forms or by crafting HTTP requests with the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
The commit addresses the issue by using the `htmlspecialchars()` function to encode the output of variables like `$_POST['username']`, `$_POST['email']`, `$_GET['editLang']`, `$_POST['image']`, `$_POST['amount']`, `$_POST['code']`, `$_POST['valid_from_date']`, `$_POST['valid_to_date']`, `$_POST['folder']`, `$_POST['quantity']`, `$_POST['position']`, `$_POST['virtual_products']`, and `$_GET['edit']` before displaying them in the HTML. This function converts special characters (e.g., <, >, ", &) into their corresponding HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code.
