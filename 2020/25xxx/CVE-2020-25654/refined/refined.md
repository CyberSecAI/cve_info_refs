  "CVE-2020-25654": {
    "description": "An ACL bypass flaw was found in pacemaker. When ACLs are not in use, any user in the haclient group has full access to the configuration, which effectively gives them the ability to run any code as root. When ACLs are in use, users still must be in the haclient group, but their read and write access to various parts of the configuration is limited by configured ACLs. The vulnerability is that users may use IPC communication with the various daemons directly to perform certain tasks that they would be prevented by ACLs from doing if they went through the configuration.",
    "root_cause": "Pacemaker daemons do not properly enforce ACL restrictions when users interact with them directly via IPC, bypassing ACL checks meant to limit access to the cluster configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "ACL restrictions bypass",
      "Insufficient input validation",
	  "Improper access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Users in the 'haclient' group can bypass configured ACL restrictions, potentially gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code as root, leading to confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attacker can use IPC communication with Pacemaker daemons to perform actions that ACLs should have restricted.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a local account on the cluster and be a member of the 'haclient' group."
