# CVE-2020-25654 pacemaker: ACL restrictions bypass

---

*From*: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <huzaifas () redhat com>

*Date*: Tue, 27 Oct 2020 13:23:01 +0530

```
Hi All,

Pacemaker is a high-availability cluster manager comprising multiple
daemon processes that interact with each other and with user requests
via IPC.

Users must either be root or in the haclient group to access Pacemaker
daemon IPC.

One of these daemons, pacemaker-based, manages the Pacemaker
configuration, known as the Cluster Information Base (CIB). Pacemaker
may be built with support for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in which case
pacemaker-based applies configured ACLs when processing user requests to
read or write any part of the configuration.

When ACLs are not in use, any user in the haclient group has full
access to the configuration, which effectively gives them the ability
to run any code as root. (This is intentional, as the point of a
cluster manager is to run arbitrary services.)

When ACLs are in use, users still must be in the haclient group, but
their read and write access to various parts of the configuration is
limited by configured ACLs.

The vulnerability is that users may use IPC communication with the
various daemons directly to perform certain tasks that they would be
prevented by ACLs from doing if they went through the configuration.
This is not difficult; Pacemaker provides command-line tools to send
many types of IPC requests.

More details along with patches is available at:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1888191>

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Hi all,

A vulnerability was found in Pacemaker allowing a user who is in the
haclient group but restricted by ACLs to bypass those ACLs. It has been
assigned the ID CVE-2020-25654.

This will be fixed in the 2.0 and master branches today, along with a
2.0.5-rc2 release that includes the fix. It will also be fixed in the
1.1 branch along with a 1.1.24-rc1 release that includes just this. I
will also post patches for the 2.0.3 and 2.0.4 releases to the
[developers at clusterlabs.org](https://lists.clusterlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/users) list.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-14 10:49:00 UTC  ``` An acl bypass flaw was found in pacemaker. When ACLs are not in use, any user in the haclient group has full access to the configuration, which effectively gives them the ability to run any code as root.   When ACLs are in use, users still must be in the haclient group, but their read and write access to various parts of the configuration is limited by configured ACLs.  The vulnerability is that users may use IPC communication with the various daemons directly to perform certain tasks that they would be prevented by ACLs from doing if they went through the configuration.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c7)  Ken Gaillot    2020-10-19 20:20:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1722698](attachment.cgi?id=1722698&action=diff "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream master branch as of 2020-10-18)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1722698&action=edit "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream master branch as of 2020-10-18)") Fix for pacemaker [CVE-2020-25654](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25654) (upstream master branch as of 2020-10-18)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c8)  Ken Gaillot    2020-10-19 20:21:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1722699](attachment.cgi?id=1722699&action=diff "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 2.0.4 release)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1722699&action=edit "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 2.0.4 release)") Fix for pacemaker [CVE-2020-25654](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25654) (upstream 2.0.4 release)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c9)  Ken Gaillot    2020-10-19 20:22:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1722700](attachment.cgi?id=1722700&action=diff "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 2.0.3 release)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1722700&action=edit "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 2.0.3 release)") Fix for pacemaker [CVE-2020-25654](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25654) (upstream 2.0.3 release)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c10)  Ken Gaillot    2020-10-19 20:22:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1722701](attachment.cgi?id=1722701&action=diff "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 1.1.23 release)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1722701&action=edit "Fix for pacemaker CVE-2020-25654 (upstream 1.1.23 release)") Fix for pacemaker [CVE-2020-25654](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25654) (upstream 1.1.23 release)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1888191#c11)  Ken Gaillot    2020-10-19 20:25:04 UTC  ``` Patches attached.

Package        : pacemaker
Version        : 1.1.24-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16877 CVE-2018-16878 CVE-2020-25654

Several security vulnerabilities were addressed in pacemaker, a cluster
resource manager.

CVE-2018-16877

    A flaw was found in the way pacemaker's client-server authentication was
    implemented. A local attacker could use this flaw, and combine it with
    other IPC weaknesses, to achieve local privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16878

    An insufficient verification inflicted preference of uncontrolled processes
    can lead to denial-of-service.

CVE-2020-25654

    An ACL bypass flaw was found in pacemaker. An attacker having a local
    account on the cluster and in the haclient group could use IPC
    communication with various daemons directly to perform certain tasks that
    they would be prevented by ACLs from doing if they went through the
    configuration.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.1.24-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pacemaker packages.

For the detailed security status of pacemaker please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pacemaker>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
