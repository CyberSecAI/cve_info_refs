- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the network session authentication process between the BD Alaris PC Unit and the BD Alaris Systems Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the authentication process, specifically within the handling of network session authentication requests. This allows for a denial-of-service attack by modifying configuration headers of data in transit.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, specifically a drop in the wireless capability of the Alaris PC Unit. This forces manual operation, preventing network-based services like EMR Interoperability and wireless updates of the Alaris System Guardrails. Note that the vulnerability does not grant administration access to the affected devices, and any PHI/PII is encrypted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs access to the network associated with the affected devices. The attacker would then redirect the BD Alaris PC Unitâ€™s authentication requests with a custom code and complete an authentication handshake based on the information extracted from the authentication requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected devices' network and low-level skills to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to intercept and modify network communication between the BD Alaris PC Unit and the BD Alaris Systems Manager.
