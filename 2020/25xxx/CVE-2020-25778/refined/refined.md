Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac's `KERedirect` kext (kernel extension). An error message generated by this kext includes sensitive information, specifically a kernel pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive kernel memory information through an error message. Specifically, a kernel pointer is being leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain a kernel pointer and potentially leak several bytes of memory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The leaked information can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and potentially execute arbitrary code within the kernel context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target macOS system. This indicates a prerequisite of prior compromise of the system.
- **Exploitation of Error Message:** The vulnerability is triggered by an error message generated by the `KERedirect` kernel extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute code with high privileges on the target machine.
- **Local Access:** The attack must be performed locally, not remotely.

**Additional Details:**
- Trend Micro has released a patch via ActiveUpdate for the 2020 (v10.x) versions of Antivirus for Mac. Users with versions 10.x will receive the patch automatically.
- Users with version 9.x or below are advised to upgrade to the latest version.
- The vulnerability was reported by Cees Elzinga from Danish Cyber Defence, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.

**CVSS Score:** 6.0 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
