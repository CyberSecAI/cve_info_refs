{
  "CVE-2020-25142": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, specifically the absence of a unique, unpredictable token in HTTP requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can induce a logged-in user to perform unintended actions on the web application by submitting malicious requests on their behalf, such as adding a server with attacker-controlled parameters.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in user, submits a forged POST request to the vulnerable endpoint."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page.",
      "The victim must be logged into the vulnerable application when visiting the malicious page."
    ],
    "details": "The provided text outlines a CSRF vulnerability in the `addsrv` component of Observium. It includes an example of a legitimate request, a vulnerable server response, and a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the attack. The lack of a CSRF token allows an attacker to craft a form on a separate website that, when submitted by an authenticated user, would execute arbitrary actions on their behalf on the targeted application. The exploit showcases how a simple HTML form can be used to submit a POST request to the /addsrv endpoint, which is then accepted as a legitimate request."
