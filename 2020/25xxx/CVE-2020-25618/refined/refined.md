Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-25618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the 'nable' user, which runs the main web interface of the SolarWinds N-Central backend, having the ability to execute specific scripts with root privileges via a `sudoers` file entry.
*   Specifically, the 'nable' user can execute the `nable_wrapper.pl` script as root without further authentication. This script acts as a wrapper for various other scripts and shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Sudo Configuration:** The `sudoers` file allows the 'nable' user to execute the `nable_wrapper.pl` script as root, without any restrictions or authentication, which creates a vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Script:** The `nable_wrapper.pl` script, and potentially the underlying scripts and commands it invokes, can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization**: Underlying scripts lack proper input validation leading to the ability to execute arbitrary code in a root context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has gained access as the 'nable' user can escalate their privileges to root, the highest level of privilege on the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With root access, the attacker can execute any code, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the SolarWinds N-Central backend server as the 'nable' user. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Exploiting a separate vulnerability
    *   Compromising a user account with nable privileges.
    *   Gaining shell access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have obtained initial access to the system with the privileges of the 'nable' user.
*   The attacker does not need any further authentication to trigger the privilege escalation, once they have the nable user access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content mentions that the vulnerability was found in SolarWinds N-Central version 12.3.0.670
*   The vulnerability was fixed in SolarWinds N-Central 2020.1 HF2.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of six vulnerabilities discovered during a research project on Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions.
