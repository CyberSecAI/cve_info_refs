# [CVE-2020-25565] SapphireIMS: Unprivileged user remote command execution on server

Posted on
Sep 19, 2020

# Description

In SapphireIMS 5.0, it is possible to use the hardcoded credential in clients (username: sapphire, password: ims) and gain access to the portal. Once the access is available, the attacker can inject malicious OS commands on “ping”, “traceroute” and “snmp” functions and execute code on the server.

# CVSS 3.0 Base Score

9.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
