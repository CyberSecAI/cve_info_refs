Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject malicious OS commands into the "ping", "traceroute", and "snmp" functions of the SapphireIMS application. This occurs after logging in with a hardcoded credential.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded credentials (username: sapphire, password: ims) on clients, allowing attackers to bypass initial authentication.
*   **Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to command injection, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server hosting the SapphireIMS application. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the application.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends GET and POST requests to trigger the command injection vulnerability, exploiting the `CmdProcess` endpoint and related functionalities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SapphireIMS server.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the hardcoded username and password (`sapphire/ims`) to log in to the application.
*   **Low Privilege:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user after gaining access to the application with the hardcoded credentials, which means they do not require a high level of access to execute commands.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates the exploitation process using `ipconfig` command, and also shows the requests for viewing the results.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tanoy Bose.
*   The vendor was informed on May 7th, 2020, but there was no successful response. Cert-CC and Cert-In were informed on September 16th, 2020.
