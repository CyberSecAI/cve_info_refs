The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25856.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `DecWPA2KeyData()` function of Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi modules. Specifically, the `rtl_memcpy` operation within this function, used when handling WPA2 key exchange, copies data from a user-controlled source (`v12__tmp2`) to a fixed-size destination buffer (`decrypted_data`). The size of the copy (`v10__keylen`) is also user-controlled, allowing an attacker to overwrite the stack by providing a `keylen` value greater than the size of the `decrypted_data` buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient bounds checking on the size of the data being copied by `rtl_memcpy`.
- The use of user-controlled values as the size parameter in `memcpy` operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the vulnerable device if the attacker can overwrite the return address with a valid address.
- Denial of Service (DoS) if the overflow corrupts the stack but doesn't result in controlled code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious WPA2 EAPOL key messages during the 4-way handshake process.
- The attacker needs to know the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) of the WPA2 network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker must know the PSK of the Wi-Fi network to successfully perform the attack. This is because `DecWPA2KeyData()` receives the PTK as a key, derived from the PSK, which is required for correctly decrypting the data before the memcpy operation, to overwrite the stack correctly for controlled code execution.
- The attacker may also need to de-authenticate the victim device from the network to force re-connection.
- The attacker may need to impersonate an access point (AP) with the same SSID to intercept the victim's connection attempt.
