## Siemens Totally Integrated Automation Portal vulnerable to privilege escalation due to Node.js paths

#### Vulnerability Note VU#466044

Original Release Date: 2021-02-09 | Last Revised: 2021-02-09

---

### Overview

Siemens Totally Integrated Administrator (TIA) fails to properly set the module search path to be used by a privileged Node.js component, which can allow an unprivileged Windows user to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The PCS neo administration console is reported to be affected as well.

### Description

Siemens TIA runs a privileged Node.js component. The Node.js server fails to properly set the module search path. Because of this, Node.js will look for modules in the `C:\node_modules\` directory when the server is started. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create this directory and place a specially-crafted `.js` file in it to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges when the server starts.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted JS file in the `C:\node_modules\` directory, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Siemens TIA or PCS neo administration console software installed.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

This issue is addressed in TIA Administrator [V1.0 SP2 Upd2](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/114358/). PCS neo administration console users should apply the mitigations described in [Industrial Security in SIMATIC PCS neo](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109771524).

//support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109771524

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

TIA Administrator is a web-based framework that can incorporate different function modules for adminis-
trative tasks, as well as functions for managing SIMATIC software and licenses.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25238

Manipulating certain ﬁles in speciﬁc folders could allow a local attacker to execute code with SYSTEM
privileges.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with a valid account and limited access
rights on the system.
