Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Siemens TIA (Totally Integrated Automation) Portal and PCS neo administration console's Node.js component fails to properly set the module search path.
- Specifically, the Node.js server searches for modules in `C:\node_modules\` by default when the server is started.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** Unprivileged Windows users can create directories and files under the system root (C:\).
- **Insecure Module Loading:** The Node.js server doesn't restrict its module search path, leading it to look in a user-writable location (C:\node_modules).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges:** An attacker can create the `C:\node_modules\` directory and place a malicious `.js` file within it. When the vulnerable server starts, it loads and executes this file, resulting in code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user gains SYSTEM level access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with a valid account and limited access rights on the system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create a directory and place a file in a specific location within the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs a valid, but unprivileged, local account on the Windows system.
- The attacker must have write access to create folders and files under the system root.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious JavaScript file.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the Node.js application not properly setting the module search path. When the Node.js component starts, it searches for modules in the `C:\node_modules\` directory. Since standard users can create this directory and its contents, they can inject malicious JavaScript that gets executed with SYSTEM privileges when the Node.js application starts up. This allows for privilege escalation from unprivileged user to SYSTEM.

The Siemens Security Advisory (SSA-428051) confirms the information in the CERT vulnerability note. It states that the vulnerability allows local users to escalate privileges and execute code as local SYSTEM user and that the CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 7.8, with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C` and the CWE being `CWE-284: Improper Access Control`.
