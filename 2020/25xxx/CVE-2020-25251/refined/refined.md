{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hyland OnBase relies heavily on client-side validation, leading to insufficient authorization checks on the server-side.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Client-side validation reliance",
    "Server-side authorization bypass",
    "Lack of proper authentication checks for administrative functions",
      "Authorization checks performed after action or even when user lacks permission",
      "Failure to verify user authentication in some cases"

  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated and underprivileged users can gain access to administrative and non-administrative actions, including reading and writing arbitrary medical records, modifying server configurations, accessing user lists and data, modifying user permissions, reconfiguring the SQL server, accessing configured DCNs, and adding custom filters.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct access to the server, bypassing client-side authorization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the server. No prior authentication might be required for certain actions."
