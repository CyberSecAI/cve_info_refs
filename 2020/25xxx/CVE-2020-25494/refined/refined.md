  "CVE-2020-25494": {
    "description": "The outputform and toclevels parameters in SCO Openserver's printbook CGI script are vulnerable to OS command injection. By injecting shell metacharacters, an attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server. Although the direct output of injected commands is not returned in the application's response, time delay commands can be used to confirm the vulnerability. External domain interactions can also verify command execution.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied parameters in the `printbook` CGI script, specifically the `outputform` and `toclevels` parameters.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "OS command injection"
    ],
     "impact": "Arbitrary OS commands execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `/cgi-bin/printbook` script, injecting malicious commands within the `outputform` and `toclevels` parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request. No authentication or special privileges are needed. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server where the vulnerable application is hosted. "
