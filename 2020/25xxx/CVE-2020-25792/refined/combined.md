|  |  | // |
|  |  | // \* An alignment is always power of 2. Therefore, with a pair of alignments, one is always |
|  |  | // a multiple of the other (one way or the other). |
|  |  | // \* A struct is aligned to at least the max alignment of each of its fields. |
|  |  | // \* A repr(C) struct follows the order of fields and pushes each as close to the previous one |
|  |  | // as allowed by alignment. |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // By placing two "fake" fields that have 0 size, but an alignment first, we make sure that all |
|  |  | // 3 start at the beginning of the struct and that all of them are aligned to their maximum |
|  |  | // alignment. |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // Furthermore, because we don't know if usize or A has bigger alignment, we decide on case by |
|  |  | // case basis if the header or the elements go first. By placing the one with higher alignment |
|  |  | // requirements first, we align that one and the other one will be aligned "automatically" when |
|  |  | // placed just after it. |
|  |  | // |
|  |  | // To the best of our knowledge, this is all guaranteed by the compiler. But just to make sure, |
|  |  | // we have bunch of asserts in the constructor to check; as these are invariants enforced by |
|  |  | // the compiler, it should be trivial for it to remove the checks so they are for free (if we |

### Description

Chunk:

* Array size is not checked when constructed with `unit()` and `pair()`.
* Array size is not checked when constructed with `From<InlineArray<A, T>>`.
* `Clone` and `insert_from` are not panic-safe; A panicking iterator causes memory safety issues with them.

InlineArray:

* Generates unaligned references for types with a large alignment requirement.

## Description

![@Qwaz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5073807?u=2ce3c5e94d4fa1db409878d8812e2dfe6cb164bf&v=4&size=48)[Qwaz](https://github.com/Qwaz)opened [on Sep 6, 2020](https://github.com/bodil/sized-chunks/issues/11#issue-694545650)

Hello, we have noticed a soundness issue and/or a potential security vulnerability in this crate while performing a security scan on crates.io.

# Description

Chunk:

* Array size is not checked when constructed with `unit()` and `pair()`.
* Array size is not checked when constructed with `From<InlineArray<A, T>>`.
* `Clone` and `insert_from` are not panic-safe; A panicking iterator causes memory safety issues with them.

InlineArray:

* Generates unaligned references for types with a large alignment requirement.

# Demonstration

* Crate: sized-chunks
* Version: 0.6.2
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Rust: rustc 1.46.0 (04488afe3 2020-08-24)
* Cargo flags: --release

```

    // Other issues that should be fixed but probably minor to include in the advisory:

    // https://github.com/bodil/sized-chunks/blob/40aa74b824688a4d4b1e1c65a50c679abb58b41e/src/sized_chunk/mod.rs#L564-L617
    // `insert_from` relies on the behavioral correctness of `ExactSizeIterator`.
    // However, `ExactSizeIterator` is a safe trait, which has the same safety guarantee with `size_hint()`.
    // Programs should not assume that they will yield a correct value in unsafe code.
    // From Rust std doc: "An incorrect implementation of `size_hint()` should not lead to memory safety violations."
    //
    // Applying `take(insert_size)` and adjusting `left` and `right` field based on the number of items that are actually moved
    // (instead of using `insert_size`) will fix the problem.

    // https://github.com/bodil/sized-chunks/blob/40aa74b824688a4d4b1e1c65a50c679abb58b41e/src/inline_array/mod.rs#L167
    // This states an actual contract, so it should be `assert!()` instead of `debug_assert!()`
    // From Rust std doc: "Replacing `assert!` with `debug_assert!` is thus only encouraged after thorough profiling, and more importantly, only in safe code!"
