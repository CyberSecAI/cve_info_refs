## Description

![@FitzBC](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22186948?u=3f7b596e8e0534ac6d76cdc556c9cd02f1e2eb2a&v=4&size=48)[FitzBC](https://github.com/FitzBC)opened [on Aug 26, 2020](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/issues/994#issue-686137898)

I am using `nfstream` to detect traffic, and the `dissect` option is turned on, which means that nfstream will use `nDPI` to complete this task. But I encountered a **memory leak** problem during use. Nfstream is developed based on the python language, memory leaks are rarely encountered, so I started to locate the cause.

In nfstream, I located the reason for this line of code : [plugin.py](https://github.com/nfstream/nfstream/blob/a57358b40d00bfaba3bf7c2f026f8350b99d97c1/nfstream/plugin.py#L373). In fact, the code calls the `ndpi_flow_free()` function in nDPI: [ndpi\_main.c](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/blob/5e1bb0dbc12f779151d386c63d7b7992b5940006/src/lib/ndpi_main.c#L6225). By comparing the memory release operation in [ndpi\_flow\_free()](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/blob/5e1bb0dbc12f779151d386c63d7b7992b5940006/src/lib/ndpi_main.c#L6225) and the [prototype of the ndpi\_flow\_struct structure](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/blob/5e1bb0dbc12f779151d386c63d7b7992b5940006/src/include/ndpi_typedefs.h#L1148), I think that ndpi\_flow\_free() has not completely released all the variables in ndpi\_flow\_struct.

I think this may be the root cause of the memory leak.
