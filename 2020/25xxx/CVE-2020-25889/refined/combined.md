# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

# Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com>
# Software Link:
<https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14438/online-bus-booking-system-project-using-phpmysql.html>
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on Windows 10/Kali Linux

SQL Injection:
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of injection attack that makes it possible
to execute malicious SQL statements. These statements control a database
server behind a web application. Attackers can use SQL Injection
vulnerabilities to bypass application security measures. They can go around
authentication and authorization of a web page or web application and
retrieve the content of the entire SQL database. They can also use SQL
Injection to add, modify, and delete records in the database.

Attack Vector:
online-bus-booking-system-project-using-PHP-MySQL version 1.0 has SQL
injection at the login page. By placing SQL injection payload on the login
page attacker can bypass the authentication and can gain the admin
privilege.

Vulnerable Parameter: Login Page

# Version: 1.0
# Tested on Windows 10/Kali Linux

Stored cross-site scripting:
Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on
the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log,
comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the
server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also
sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.

Attack Vector:
student management system project version 1.0 is vulnerable to stored XSS.
Each time while editing the subjects XSS popup will reflect.

# Online Bus Booking System Project Using PHP/MySQL

Submitted by [oretnom23](/users/tips23 "View user profile.") on Wednesday, September 9, 2020 - 21:01.
Language
[PHP](/language/php)

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020-09/images/home-img.png?itok=kC5wA1ko)](/sites/default/files/2020-09/images/home-img.png)

The Online Bus Booking System is a project using PHP/MySQL. This project also used jQuery and Ajax to make user interaction or experience be much better when handling a form. To develop the system, I used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery/ Ajax), and Bootsrap.

## About the Project

The Online Bus Booking System is a system that manages the bus company booking or ticketing processes. On the system administrator side, admin can manage the list of buses, locations, schedules and list of booked schedules. Passenger can simply go the site and find his/her desired schedule and location and copy the reference number for his/her booking ticket. Admin will update the passenger booked schedule for payment when they arrive to the departure location.

## Features

### Admin Side

* Home Page - This page is the welcoming page of administrator after logging into the system.
* Bus List Page - This is the page where buses are listed and also where can admin users can manage the buses.
* Location - This page helps to organize the bus company location route. At this page, admin can manage the list of locations.
* Schedule Page - This is the page where all bus route schedules are listed. At this page, admin can create, update and delete and bus route schedule for booking.
* Booked Page - The page where the passengers booked schedules are listed. Admin can update the details and payment status of passenger schedule.
* Users Page - The page where are admin users of the system are listed and can be managed.

### Passenger Side

* Home Page - The welcoming page for the passenger when he/she browses the website. On this page, passenger can find his/her desired location and schedules.
* Schedule Page - The page where can passenger see all bus company route schedules.

## Installation

1. Download the source code and extract the zip file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs PHP script.
3. Open your web server database and create a new database name it **bus\_booking**.
4. Import the **SQL** file located in the **database folder** of the **source code**.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. Example for XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. e.g [ http://localhost/online-bus-booking-system ]

Then there you go, you can now explore and modify the system.

## Admin Default Access

**Username: admin**

**Password: admin123**

### **Note**

To access the admin login page, browse the **admin.php** in your URL . For example **http://localhost/online-bus-booking-system/admin.php**

I hope this project will help you for what you are looking for. Feel free to download and modify.

Explore to this website for more source code or tutorial.

Enjoy!

Dear Team,

Please find attached POC and detailed information for CVE-2020-25889 &
CVE-2020-25955.

For CVE-2020-25889:
# Exploit Title: online bus booking system project using PHP MySQL - SQL
Injection
# Exploit Author: Krishna Yadav
# Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com>
# Software Link:
<https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14438/online-bus-booking-system-project-using-phpmysql.html>
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on Windows 10/Kali Linux

SQL Injection:
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of injection attack that makes it possible
to execute malicious SQL statements. These statements control a database
server behind a web application. Attackers can use SQL Injection
vulnerabilities to bypass application security measures. They can go around
authentication and authorization of a web page or web application and
retrieve the content of the entire SQL database. They can also use SQL
Injection to add, modify, and delete records in the database.

Attack Vector:
online-bus-booking-system-project-using-PHP-MySQL version 1.0 has SQL
injection at the login page. By placing SQL injection payload on the login
page attacker can bypass the authentication and can gain the admin
privilege.

Vulnerable Parameter: Login Page

==========================================================================================================================================

 For CVE-2020-25955
# Exploit Title: student management system project PHP - Stored cross-site
scripting
# Exploit Author: Krishna Yadav
# Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com>
# Software Link:
<https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14443/student-management-system-project-php.html>
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on Windows 10/Kali Linux

Stored cross-site scripting:
Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on
the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log,
comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the
server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also
sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.

Attack Vector:
student management system project version 1.0 is vulnerable to stored XSS.
Each time while editing the subjects XSS popup will reflect.

Vulnerable Parameter: Add subject tab is vulnerable to stored XSS.

NOTE: For better understanding, please look at the attached POCs for both
CVE IDs.

Kindly publish the details ASAP.

Thanks & Regards,
Krishna Yadav
