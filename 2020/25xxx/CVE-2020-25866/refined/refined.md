{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-25866",
  "description": "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.6 and 3.0.0 to 3.0.13, the BLIP protocol dissector has a NULL pointer dereference because a buffer was sized for compressed (not uncompressed) messages. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-blip.c by allowing reasonable compression ratios and rejecting ZIP bombs.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BLIP dissector used a statically allocated buffer of 16 Kb for decompressing compressed messages. This buffer was sized for compressed, not uncompressed messages, leading to a buffer overflow when processing larger uncompressed data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient buffer size for decompressed data",
       "Lack of input validation/size checking",
       "NULL pointer dereference due to failed decompression"
    ],
    "impact": "A malformed packet, either injected on the wire or read from a capture file, could cause Wireshark to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This can be used for a denial of service attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network injection of malformed BLIP packets",
      "Opening a malformed BLIP packet trace file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send a crafted BLIP packet or have a user open a crafted packet capture file with Wireshark.",
    "patches": [
          "The fix involves changing the decompression buffer from static allocation of 16kb to a preference with a 64kb default, and adding a null check in the dissector to display an error message instead of crashing."
