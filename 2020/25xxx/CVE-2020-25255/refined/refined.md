```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Hyland OnBase server fails to properly sanitize data before writing it to logs and directly exposes logging methods to attackers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Log injection through exposed logging methods without proper input validation.",
    "Log injection through exception handling by concatenating user input directly into the exception message.",
    "Lack of rate limiting or size constraints on user-supplied log data."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can create arbitrary log entries, potentially ruining the integrity of the logs, and cause a denial of service by writing frequently or excessively large log entries, rendering the server unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "Attackers can send malicious requests directly to the OnBase server logging methods or trigger exception handling with malicious user input.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers can be unauthenticated and can make network requests to the OnBase server."
