    },
     "FreeBSD Advisory": {
          "Background": "login.access(5) is a system configuration file allowing administrators to define policy around system login access by specific users and groups. It is implemented by a pam(3) module, pam\\_login\\_access(8), and is configured by default for accesses via sshd(8), telnetd(8) and the system console.",
          "Problem Description": "A regression in the login.access(5) rule processor has the effect of causing rules to fail to match even when they should not. This means that rules denying access may be ignored.",
          "Impact": "The configuration in login.access(5) may not be applied, permitting login access to users even when the system is configured to deny it.",
          "Workaround": "No workaround is available. Systems not relying on login.access(5) to enforce custom login policies are not affected.",
         "Solution": "Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date."
     },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "A regression in the login.access(5) rule processor",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "rules to fail to match even when they should not",
        "rules denying access may be ignored"
      ],
     "Impact": "The configuration in login.access(5) may not be applied, permitting login access to users even when the system is configured to deny it.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Accesses via sshd(8), telnetd(8) and the system console."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to have some access to system login to exploit this vulnerability."
    }
  }
