{
  "CVE-2020-25673": {
    "Root cause": "The `llcp_sock_connect()` function in the Linux kernel's NFC subsystem does not properly handle non-blocking sockets. Specifically, when a non-blocking socket is used, the `sock_wait_state` function returns immediately with `-EINPROGRESS`, and the connection attempt does not complete. This leaves the socket in a state where resources such as `llcp_sock->dev`, `llcp_sock->local`, `llcp_sock->ssap`, and `llcp_sock->service_name` are not freed. Also the socket is linked to `local->connecting_sockets`. Repeated calls to `llcp_sock_connect()` with a non-blocking socket and invalid service name leads to resource leakage.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Resource Leak",
       "Improper handling of non-blocking sockets",
       "Double linking of socket to local->connecting_sockets"
    ],
    "Impact": "Repeated calls to `llcp_sock_connect()` with non-blocking sockets causes a resource leak leading to a denial of service. Also, double linking of the socket in `local->connecting_sockets` can lead to an infinite loop, causing a system hang.",
     "Attack vectors": "A local user can create a non-blocking NFC socket and repeatedly attempt to connect using the `llcp_sock_connect()` function with an invalid service name.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with the ability to create and interact with NFC sockets."
