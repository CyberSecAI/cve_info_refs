The provided content describes a vulnerability in Hyland OnBase software, which is related to the use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and initialization vectors (IVs). This aligns with CVE-2020-25256 which is a placeholder, meaning it's highly likely the described vulnerability is what would be assigned to that CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Hardcoded PKI certificates (including public and private keys) within the OnBase binaries.
*   Hardcoded AES CBC initialization vectors (IVs), often set to all zeros, used across all messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Cryptographic Keys:** The use of static, hardcoded PKI certificates allows attackers to potentially impersonate legitimate entities or decrypt data.
*   **Predictable IVs:** The use of constant and predictable IVs (such as all zeros) in AES CBC mode makes it easier for attackers to decrypt ciphertext.
*   Lack of key or IV variation between installations and versions (except for some certificates between versions).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Decryption:** Attackers can use the hardcoded certificates and predictable IVs to decrypt sensitive data that was encrypted using these keys.
*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can potentially use the hardcoded certificates for unauthorized access or impersonation of legitimate entities within the system.
*   Potential for manipulation of encrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Reverse engineering or decompilation of the OnBase binaries to extract the hardcoded keys and certificates.
*   Network interception of encrypted communications to perform decryption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to obtain or access Hyland OnBase binaries.
*   Ability to intercept network traffic between OnBase components (for decryption).
*   Technical knowledge to perform reverse engineering/decompilation, and cryptography-related tasks.
