Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25664

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `PopShortPixel` function within the `MagickCore/quantum-private.h` file of the ImageMagick library.
- The root cause lies in an improper call to `AcquireVirtualMemory()` and `memset()` in `WriteOnePNGImage()` function of the PNG coder at `coders/png.c`. This leads to an out-of-bounds write when `PopShortPixel()` is called. Specifically, the `AcquireVirtualMemory` call doesn't allocate enough memory and the subsequent memset may write past allocated memory. The patch corrects this issue by adding `256` to `rowbytes` in these calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Out-of-bounds memory write

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A specially crafted image can cause an out-of-bounds memory write, leading to a crash.
- The primary impact is to system availability. There is a low impact to data integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path in ImageMagick.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted image file.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick versions 7.0.8-68 and 6.9.10-68.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are not affected by this vulnerability due to being out of support scope.
- Inkscape is not affected as it no longer bundles ImageMagick in RHEL 8.
- The fix involves adjusting the memory allocation size when processing PNG images.
