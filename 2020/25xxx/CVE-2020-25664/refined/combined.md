| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-11-24 18:57:31 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-11-24 18:57:33 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1891605,1901226  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c2)  Fedora Admin user for bugzilla script actions    2021-10-13 00:14:24 UTC  ``` This package has changed maintainer in Fedora. Reassigning to the new maintainer of this component.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c3)  Fedora Admin user for bugzilla script actions    2021-10-13 12:11:03 UTC  ``` This package has changed maintainer in Fedora. Reassigning to the new maintainer of this component.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c4)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 13:40:44 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c5)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 14:10:18 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life.

Soon you'll be able to install the update with the following command: `sudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing --advisory=FEDORA-2021-b58af96f33` You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-b58af96f33>  See also [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for more information on how to test updates.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c9)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-30 16:08:33 UTC  ``` Fedora 33 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2021-11-30. Fedora 33 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226#c10)  Fedora Update System    2021-12-05 01:37:41 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-b58af96f33 has been pushed to the Fedora 34 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-10-26 19:48:51 UTC  ``` In ImageMagick, there is a heap-buffer-overflow at MagickCore/quantum-private.h:227:12 in PopShortPixel.  Reference: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1716>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/1f450bb5ba53d275de6d1cd086c98a0b549ad393>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c1)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-28 20:40:05 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  In WriteOnePNGImage() of the PNG coder at coders/png.c, an improper call to AcquireVirtualMemory() and memset() allows for an out-of-bounds write later when PopShortPixel() from MagickCore/quantum-private.h is called. The patch fixes the calls by adding 256 to rowbytes. An attacker who is able to supply a specially crafted image could affect availability with a low impact to data integrity.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c2)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-28 21:13:09 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Suhwan Song (Seoul National University)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c3)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-29 19:10:26 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Inkscape is not affected because it no longer uses a bundled ImageMagick in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. For more information regarding support scopes, please see <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata> .   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c4)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-11-24 18:57:40 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1901225](show_bug.cgi?id=1901225 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25664 ImageMagick: heap-based buffer overflow in PopShortPixel in MagickCore/quantum-private.h [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1901226](show_bug.cgi?id=1901226 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25664 ImageMagick: heap-based buffer overflow in PopShortPixel in MagickCore/quantum-private.h [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1891605#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-24 23:33:56 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-25664>   ``` |  |
