Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25677:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `ceph-ansible` component creates the `/etc/ceph/iscsi-gateway.conf` configuration file with insecure default permissions. Specifically, the file is created without specifying mode 600 (read/write for owner, no access for others).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The configuration file has overly permissive file permissions allowing any user on the system to read it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Any local user on the system can read the contents of `/etc/ceph/iscsi-gateway.conf`. This file contains sensitive information, potentially including credentials or other configuration details, leading to a confidentiality breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the system where the vulnerable configuration file exists to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** Any user on the system can exploit this vulnerability by reading the file. No special privileges are needed to read the file due to its insecure permissions.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects `ceph-ansible` specifically, leading to insecure permissions on `/etc/ceph/iscsi-gateway.conf`.
- The fix involves specifying the correct permissions (mode 600) when creating this file.
- The issue was addressed in `ceph-ansible-4.0.41` as indicated in the "Fixed In Version" field of the bug report.
- A Red Hat Security Advisory `RHSA-2021:0081` was released to address the vulnerability in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4.2.
- Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 shipped with the vulnerable code, but it does not deploy `ceph-iscsi-gw` in supported scenarios. Thus, it was not fixed for RHOSP 13.
