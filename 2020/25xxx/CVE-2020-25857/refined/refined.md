{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ClientEAPOLKeyRecvd() function within the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi module's firmware.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability occurs within the `ClientEAPOLKeyRecvd` function. A call to `rtl_memcpy` copies data into a local buffer `decrypted_data` with a fixed size of 128 bytes. The length of data to be copied is derived from a user controlled value in `EapolKeyMsgRecvd.Octet` without sufficient validation or bounds checking, leading to a stack buffer overflow. Specifically, the length of data to copy is determined by `v23__EapolKeyMsgRecvd[94] + (v23__EapolKeyMsgRecvd[93] << 8)`.",
       "The destination buffer, `decrypted_data`, has a fixed size of 128 bytes, while the source size to be copied can be larger, causing a stack overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service by overwriting the return address of `ClientEAPOLKeyRecvd()`. However, because the source buffer `GTK` is not controlled by the attacker, arbitrary code execution is not possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted EAPOL packets during the WPA2 handshake process.",
      "The attacker does not need to know the network's PSK to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker within Wi-Fi range of a vulnerable device can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious WPA2 EAPOL key message to the device when it is acting as a client."
