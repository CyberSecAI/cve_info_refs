**Content Analysis:**

The provided content from `docs.craftercms.org` directly references CVE-2020-25803 within a list of security advisories.  The github content is not relevant to this CVE.

**CVE-2020-25803 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the deep inspection of FreeMarker template exposed objects. This indicates that the application allows developers to access and manipulate objects within FreeMarker templates in a way that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Template Processing:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient restrictions on what can be accessed and executed through FreeMarker templates. This allows for deep inspection and access to internal objects and methods not intended for external exposure.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By manipulating FreeMarker templates, attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the Crafter CMS. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Template Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the ability to inject malicious code via FreeMarker templates.
    *   **Deep Object Inspection:** The core issue is the ability to deeply inspect and use objects exposed within the FreeMarker context, which allows for execution of commands.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with developer privileges in Crafter Studio. This implies a high level of access and permission within the application.

**Summary**
This vulnerability allows authenticated developers to execute arbitrary operating system commands by exploiting the deep inspection capabilities of FreeMarker templates within CrafterCMS.
