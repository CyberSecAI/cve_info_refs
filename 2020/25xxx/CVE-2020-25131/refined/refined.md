Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25131

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling user-supplied data. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the `role_name` and `role_descr` parameters in a POST request to `/roles/`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected JavaScript payload is stored within the application's database or file system and is executed whenever a user views the affected data.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the user-supplied `role_name` and `role_descr` parameters, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected.
*  **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The application fails to encode the stored data when it is rendered in HTML, which would prevent the browser from interpreting the malicious script as executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which is then executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information through the execution of malicious code.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance or behavior of the application.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could manipulate the application to perform phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/roles/` endpoint.
*   **Form Data:** The payload is injected through the `role_name` and `role_descr` parameters, which use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.
*   **Payload Example:** The provided payload, `%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%281%29%3E`, demonstrates how an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code using an SVG `onload` event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided example does not appear to require user authentication, meaning that any network-adjacent attacker may be able to exploit this.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know which parameters are vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a full request and partial response, demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community version 20.8.10631
*   The affected component is within the "Roles" feature
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Remote" attack type.
