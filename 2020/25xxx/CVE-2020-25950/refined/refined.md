{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the CSRF token when deleting a contact.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a victim into deleting their contact information without their consent or knowledge.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a delete request to the server. The attacker then tricks the victim into visiting the malicious page via a link. The victim's browser sends the delete request with the victim's session cookie, bypassing the CSRF protection due to the server's failure to validate the token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page and trick the victim into opening it while they are logged into the application."
