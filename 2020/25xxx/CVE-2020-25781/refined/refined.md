Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25781:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2020-25781. The provided text includes:

*   A description of the vulnerability, matching the CVE description: "Users without access to view private issue notes are able to download the (supposedly private) attachments linked to these notes by accessing the corresponding file download URL directly."
*   Links to the MantisBT bug tracker issue ([https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=27039](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=27039)) that addresses the vulnerability.
*   References to the specific commits ([http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/5595c90f11c48164331a20bb9c66098980516e93](http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/5595c90f11c48164331a20bb9c66098980516e93) and [http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/9de20c09e5a557e57159a61657ce62f1a4f578fe](http://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/9de20c09e5a557e57159a61657ce62f1a4f578fe)) that fix the vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient access control check in `file_download.php`. The system was not verifying if a user had permission to view the bug note before allowing them to download associated attachments. This allowed a user with access to an issue but not its private notes, to bypass access controls and download private attachments directly via the file's download URL.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks at the bugnote level when downloading attachments. The system only verified access to the bug itself, not to the specific note where the attachment was added.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability is exploitable by using a direct file download URL that doesn't adequately check access permissions based on the context of the bugnote it's associated with.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a confidentiality breach. Users who should not have access to private attachments are able to download them, exposing sensitive information that was intended to be restricted.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker can access the file download URL directly by crafting a URL with the known `file_id` and `type=bug`, bypassing the normal access control mechanisms.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to bug ID and file ID:** The attacker needs to be aware of a valid bug ID that contains attachments on a private bug note, along with a valid file ID for a private attachment.
*   **Basic User Access:** The attacker needs to have basic access to the project that the issue belongs to, but does not require specific access to private notes.
*   **Ability to construct a URL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a file download URL.

**Additional Technical Details:**

The provided content includes:

*   **Code Changes:** The commit diffs in `core/file_api.php` and `file_download.php` show the specific code changes made to introduce the bugnote-level access checks. These include the addition of `file_can_view_bugnote_attachments` and `file_can_download_bugnote_attachments` functions. These changes ensured that attachments associated with private bug notes could not be accessed by users who lacked access to those notes. The `file_get_visible_attachments` function was also modified to exclude attachments the current user could not access at bugnote level.
*   **MantisBT Issue #27039:** This issue describes the vulnerability in detail, including the steps to reproduce it. It shows the communication between the reporter and developers which provides great context.
*   **Patch:** A patch was provided as part of the bug report that can be used to fix the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-25781 is a vulnerability in MantisBT where a lack of proper access control allowed unauthorized users to download private attachments through a direct URL manipulation. The fix involved adding granular permission checks for bug notes attachments, ensuring users can only access files they are authorized to view, including when accessing the download URL directly.
