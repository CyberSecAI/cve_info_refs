Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin.php` file of the Online Bus Booking System 1.0. Specifically, the login authentication mechanism is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-provided `username` and `password` parameters into the SQL query without sanitizing or escaping special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `username` and `password` input fields in the login form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.

- **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing authentication, the attacker gains administrative privileges.

- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly demonstrated, successful SQL injection can sometimes be leveraged to achieve remote code execution depending on the database setup and permissions. This is a significant impact because it means an attacker can potentially run commands on the server, which is beyond the scope of just bypassing authentication. The provided information states "Impact Code execution - true", indicating the presence of this risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the admin login page (`admin.php`) and `login_auth.php`

- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to `login_auth.php` with malicious SQL injection strings in the `username` and `password` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a POST request with the malicious payloads.
- **No user account is needed:** The vulnerability is present in the login process, and therefore does not require prior access to any user account.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker achieves login bypass by sending the following payload in the POST request to `login_auth.php`:

```
username=admin' or '1'='1
password=admin' or '1'='1
```

This payload, when inserted directly into the SQL query, effectively bypasses the authentication logic, because the resulting SQL query always returns a true condition, which causes the application to grant login access to an attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

- The affected software is identified as "Online Bus Booking System 1.0" from SourceCodester.
- The vulnerability is present in the `bus_booking/admin.php` and `bus_booking/login_auth.php` files.
