- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TCP stack of the affected products does not correctly validate the sequence number for incoming TCP RST packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of specified index, position, or offset in input (CWE-1285)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could terminate arbitrary TCP sessions, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device.
