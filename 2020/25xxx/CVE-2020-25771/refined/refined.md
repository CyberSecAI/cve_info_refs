Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-25771:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `scanServer64` module of Trend Micro Apex One. This insufficient validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-Bounds Read: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This is caused by the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. The information disclosed is from memory, which could potentially contain sensitive data.
- Privilege Escalation: Although not the primary impact, the advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the target system, meaning they need to be able to execute code on the system. This could be via compromised user account or an existing foothold.
- Code Execution: The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system, which is a prerequisite for triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Code Execution: The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to trigger the vulnerability.
- User-Supplied Data: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating user-supplied data, which is then improperly handled by the `scanServer64` module.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-05-13.
- Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The ZDI advisory number is ZDI-20-1223.
- The CVSS score is 5.5 with the vector string being AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. This indicates a local attack with low privilege and no user interaction is required to achieve a high confidentiality impact.
