Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of **hard-coded credentials** for a system account on Rubetek cameras. This account is used to access the Telnet service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The cameras have a default, static password for a high-privileged system account.
*   **Unchangeable Default Password:** The default password for the Telnet service cannot be changed via standard functionality.
*   **Un-disableable Telnet Service:** The Telnet service cannot be disabled, which exposes a potential attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain full control of the affected camera with root-level privileges.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can potentially cause a denial of service by disrupting the device's normal operation.
*   **Escalation of Privileges:** The attacker gains access with a highly privileged account, allowing for privilege escalation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can access sensitive information stored on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Any attacker with network access to the cameras can attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Telnet Service:** The attack vector is through the Telnet service, which is exposed by default.
*   **Default Credentials:** Exploitation involves using the static default password to authenticate with the Telnet service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the affected Rubetek camera.
*   **Telnet Client:** The attacker requires a Telnet client to connect to the service.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker must be aware of the hard-coded default password for the system account.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability affects Rubetek camera models RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411, specifically with firmware versions 339 and 342.
* The vendor was notified of the vulnerability, but no fixed versions were available at the time of the report.
* The advisory also provides a link to the Jet Infosystems website, the discoverer's employer.
