An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash) via specially crafted packets.",

  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the certificate list syntax verification within the `certificateListValidate` function in `servers/slapd/schema_init.c` of OpenLDAP. A separate flaw was also identified in the handling of CSN normalization.",

      "attack_vector": "Network. Sending specially crafted packets.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the affected service. No authentication is required.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, without requiring any prior authentication. Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the slapd daemon, causing a denial of service. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited."
