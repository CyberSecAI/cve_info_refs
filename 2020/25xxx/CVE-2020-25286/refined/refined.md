The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25286.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the fact that WordPress was displaying comment excerpts from password-protected posts and pages under certain conditions, which it should not do.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: Comment excerpts from password-protected posts were being displayed when they shouldn't be. This could leak information that was intended to be private.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive content within comments of password-protected posts or pages could be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who can trigger the display of comment excerpts.
- This would most likely be through the use of a block that shows recent comments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to view the comment excerpts if the conditions to display the excerpts are met.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the display of comments, likely through a "latest comments" block on a page.
