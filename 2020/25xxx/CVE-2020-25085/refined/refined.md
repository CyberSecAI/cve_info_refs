Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25085:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read/write access issue within the SDHCI (SD Host Controller Interface) emulator in QEMU, specifically during multi-block SDMA (System Direct Memory Access) transfers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Access:** When performing multi-block SDMA, if the transfer block size exceeds the allocated buffer size (`s->fifo_buffer[s->buf_maxsz]`), the data pointer `s->data_count` may point beyond the buffer's boundary.
- **Lack of Proper Size Validation:** The code does not correctly validate the transfer block size against the maximum buffer size. Specifically, the 'Transfer Block Size' field was not properly masked, allowing for values exceeding the maximum.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The initial patch for a related issue (CVE-2020-17380) was insufficient to fully address this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user/process can exploit this vulnerability to cause QEMU to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition for the host system.
- **Potential for Information Disclosure and Modification:** The out-of-bounds access could potentially be leveraged for unauthorized data access and modification within the QEMU process. This is mentioned in the NetApp advisory but not explicitly stated in the original report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest Exploitation:** A malicious user or process running within a virtual machine (guest OS) can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the SDHCI device within a QEMU guest.
- **Control over SDMA Transfers:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the SDHCI controller to initiate multi-block SDMA transfers and control the block size.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks` function within `hw/sd/sdhci.c`
- The `s->data_count` is used as the offset into `s->fifo_buffer`. If the block size is set too high, `s->data_count` will exceed the allocated size of the fifo buffer, resulting in out of bounds memory access when the subsequent DMA read/write operation is performed.
- The fix involves ensuring that the block size is masked to 12 bits when writing the SDHC_BLKSIZE register, and additionally includes assertions to check the validity of `s->data_count`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from Ruhr-University Bochum.
*   A patch was developed to address the incorrect masking of the block size value.
*   The initial fix was found to be incomplete, and a new series of patches was proposed (and assigned CVE-2021-3409).
*   Multiple vendors, including Debian and NetApp, were impacted, requiring them to release security updates.
