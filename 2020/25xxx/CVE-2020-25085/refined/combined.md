Subject: CVE-2020-25085 QEMU: sdhci: out-of-bounds access issue while doing
 multi block SDMA

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds r/w access issue was found in the SDHCI Controller emulator
of QEMU. It may occur while doing multi block SDMA, if transfer block size
exceeds the 's->fifo_buffer[s->buf_maxsz]' size. It'd leave the current
element pointer 's->data_count' pointing out of bounds. Leading the subsequent
DMA r/w operation to OOB access issue. A guest user/process may use this flaw
to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS scenario.

Upstream patches:

   -> <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg01439.html>

* This issue was reported by Sergej Schumilo, Cornelius Aschermann, Simon
   Wrner of Ruhr-University Bochum.

* 'CVE-2020-25085' assigned via <https://cveform.mitre.org>

Thank you.

Subject: CVE-2021-3409 QEMU: sdhci: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2020-25085

Hello,

QEMU upstream commit [1] was supposed to fix CVE-2020-17380 and
CVE-2020-25085, both involving a heap buffer overflow in the SDHCI
controller emulation code. In fact, commit [1] turned out to be
incomplete, in that it was still possible to reproduce the same
issue(s) with specially crafted input, inducing a bogus transfer and
subsequent out-of-bounds read/write access in sdhci_do_adma() or
sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks().

A new series has been proposed (not merged yet) to address those
issues, and CVE-2021-3409 was assigned to facilitate
tracking/backporting of the new patch.

Old patch:
[1] <https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=dfba99f17feb6d4a129da19d38df1bcd8579d1c3>

New patch series:
<https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-03/msg00949.html>

CVE-2021-3409 assigned by Red Hat, Inc.

Best regards.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

qemu-system-i386: hw/sd/sdhci.c:632: void
sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks(SDHCIState *): Assertion `s->data_count
<= s->buf_maxsz && s->data_count > begin' failed.

Tested-by: Philippe Mathieu-DaudÃ© <f4bug@amsat.org>

If you don't mind I might split the assert in 2 when applying:

-            assert(s->data_count <= s->buf_maxsz && s->data_count > begin);
+            assert(s->data_count <= s->buf_maxsz);
+            assert(s->data_count > begin);

To directly display the problem straight:

qemu-system-i386: hw/sd/sdhci.c:635: void
sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks(SDHCIState *): Assertion `s->data_count
> begin' failed.

Thanks,

Phil.
