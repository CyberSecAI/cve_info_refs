{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Several Ansible modules were missing `no_log=True` for `privatekey_content` (and similar) options.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "The `privatekey_content` options in the affected modules were not marked with `no_log=True`.",
    "This caused the private key content to be unintentionally dumped into system logs and returned in the registered results' invocation field."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of private key material in system logs and registered results, leading to a confidentiality breach.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to system logs or Ansible task results could potentially recover the exposed private key material.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs access to the system logs or Ansible task results where the private key content was exposed."
