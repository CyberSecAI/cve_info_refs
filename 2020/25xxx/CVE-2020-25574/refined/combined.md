* `>=0.1.20`

Affected Functions
Version
`http::header::HeaderMap::reserve`

* `<0.1.20`

### Description

`HeaderMap::reserve()` used `usize::next_power_of_two()` to calculate the increased capacity.
However, `next_power_of_two()` silently overflows to 0 if given a sufficiently large number
in release mode.

If the map was not empty when the overflow happens,
the library will invoke `self.grow(0)` and start infinite probing.
This allows an attacker who controls the argument to `reserve()`
to cause a potential denial of service (DoS).

The flaw was corrected in 0.1.20 release of `http` crate.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# HTTP

A general purpose library of common HTTP types

[![CI](https://github.com/hyperium/http/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hyperium/http/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
[![Crates.io](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f302e33a6a8396bfd078a1ac10e1d8e0454ea12505ef4190a680899291d32a13/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6372617465732f762f687474702e737667)](https://crates.io/crates/http)
[![Documentation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b1ba9841485b8b7b8ee5eaa3428eac550256c26fab788c5205c6dc11195513cb/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e72732f687474702f62616467652e737667)](https://docs.rs/http)

More information about this crate can be found in the [crate
documentation](https://docs.rs/http).

## Usage

To use `http`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
http = "1.0"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```
use http::{Request, Response};

fn main() {
    // ...
}
```

## Examples

Create an HTTP request:

```
use http::Request;

fn main() {
    let request = Request::builder()
      .uri("https://www.rust-lang.org/")
      .header("User-Agent", "awesome/1.0")
      .body(())
      .unwrap();
}
```

Create an HTTP response:

```
use http::{Response, StatusCode};

fn main() {
    let response = Response::builder()
      .status(StatusCode::MOVED_PERMANENTLY)
      .header("Location", "https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html")
      .body(())
      .unwrap();
}
```

## Description

[http/src/header/map.rs](https://github.com/hyperium/http/blob/9c05e391e00474abaa8c14a86bcb0fc5eff1120e/src/header/map.rs#L622-L640)

|  | pub fn reserve(&mut self, additional: usize) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | // TODO: This can't overflow if done properly... since the max # of |
|  | // elements is u16::MAX. |
|  | let cap = self.entries.len() |
|  | .checked\_add(additional) |
|  | .expect("reserve overflow"); |
|  |  |
|  | if cap > self.indices.len() { |
|  | let cap = cap.next\_power\_of\_two(); |
|  |  |
|  | if self.entries.len() == 0 { |
|  | self.mask = cap - 1; |
|  | self.indices = vec![Pos::none(); cap].into\_boxed\_slice(); |
|  | self.entries = Vec::with\_capacity(usable\_capacity(cap)); |
|  | } else { |
|  | self.grow(cap); |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  | } |

[`usize::next_power_of_two()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.usize.html#method.next_power_of_two) method silently overflows to 0 in release mode. This makes it possible to shrink the size of the map to 0 with `HeaderMap::reserve()`.

* If the map doesn't contain any entry, it sets the mask value to `usize::MAX` which is inconsistent but doesn't create any immediate harm.
* If the map contains any entry, the code will call `self.grow(0)` and start infinite probing in [this line](https://github.com/hyperium/http/blob/9c05e391e00474abaa8c14a86bcb0fc5eff1120e/src/header/map.rs#L1623).

Another problem is that the assertion for `MAX_SIZE` doesn't exist here, so it is possible to grow the map larger than `MAX_SIZE`.
