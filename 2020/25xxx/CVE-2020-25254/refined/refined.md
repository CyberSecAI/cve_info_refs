```
Root cause of vulnerability: Direct string concatenation is used to build SQL queries. Client-side validation is relied on, with inadequate server-side validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: SQL injection, including connection string injection. Over 50 vulnerable methods found in OnBase 19, and several hundred in OnBase 18, with many methods containing multiple vulnerable parameters (e.g. "TableName", "ColumnName", "Name", "UserId", and "Password"). Some vulnerable methods do not require authentication.

Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed as the database administrator. The database can be modified, deleted, or have data inserted or read. Backend services can be probed. OnBase can be connected to a malicious or attacker-controlled SQL server.

Attack vectors: Sending SOAP requests to the OnBase server querying the vulnerable service method and using the injection point.

Required attacker capabilities/position: In many cases, no authentication is needed. Some attacks require a basic user account. Some require special (but not admin) permissions.
