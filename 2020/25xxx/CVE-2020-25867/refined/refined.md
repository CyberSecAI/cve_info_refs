{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the usage of `strcmp` for comparing the sharing key in `includes/header.inc`. The `strcmp` function returns NULL when one of the parameters is an array, and due to PHP's type juggling, a non-strict comparison between NULL and 0 evaluates to true.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHP Type Juggling",
      "Use of non-strict comparison with strcmp"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the sharing key authentication mechanism and access the calendar content without providing the correct sharing key.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a request with a specific crafted query parameter for the sharing key (`cle[]`), an attacker can cause the `strcmp` to return NULL, which is then loosely compared with 0 and evaluates to true, therefore granting unauthorized access.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests with custom parameters to the vulnerable application."
  },
  "fix": "The vulnerability can be fixed by either using a strict comparison (`===`) with `strcmp` or by performing the comparison directly with the strict comparison operator (`===`) without using the `strcmp` function.",
