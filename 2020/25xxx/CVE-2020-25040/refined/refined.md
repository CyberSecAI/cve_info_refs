Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25040:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions on temporary directories used during container build operations (both explicit and implicit) in Sylabs Singularity versions up to 3.6.2. This is a distinct issue from CVE-2020-25039, which involves insecure permissions during container execution with fakeroot or user namespaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary Directory Permissions:** When Singularity builds a container, it creates temporary directories to store intermediate files. These directories are created with insufficient permission restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the system can read the contents of the container image during the build process due to the insecure permissions on the temporary directories.
*   **Arbitrary Content Injection:** If the container image contains a world-writable file or directory, an attacker can inject arbitrary content into the running build.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected content could lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process and/or when the built container is later run. This arises because the injected content might alter the container's build or runtime environment in unexpected ways.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the system where the Singularity container build operation is being performed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **System Access:**  The attacker requires access to the system where the vulnerable Singularity build operation is taking place. This access can be as a regular user on the system, and does not require root privileges

**Additional Details:**

*   **Mitigation:** Setting `TMPDIR` to a location only accessible to the user will prevent other users from accessing these insecurely created directories. This is a difficult to enforce configuration, therefore it is not recommended as the only mitigation.
*   **Affected Versions:** Sylabs Singularity versions up to and including 3.6.2 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The issue is resolved in Singularity version 3.6.3 and later.
*   **CVSS Scores:**
    *   **NVD:**
        *   CVSS v2: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P)
        *   CVSS v3: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
    *   **SUSE:**
        *   CVSS v3: 6.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

The SUSE information indicates a discrepancy in the CVSS v3 scores between the NVD and SUSE. The NVD lists a network attack vector while SUSE lists a local vector, with the difference in impact being a result. This is important to note, as the attack vector greatly determines the potential impact and exploitability. The SUSE scoring seems more accurate given the nature of the vulnerability.
