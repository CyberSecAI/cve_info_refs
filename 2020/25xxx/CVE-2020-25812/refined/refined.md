  "vulnerability": "CVE-2020-25812",
  "description": "The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the MediaWiki software. It is triggered by the use of unescaped messages in HTML on the Special:Contributions page.",
  "affected_component": "mediawiki",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-generated or dynamic content (messages) which are directly inserted into HTML without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `SpecialContributions.php` file is affected, which generates the content of the Special:Contributions page.",
  "vulnerability": "XSS vulnerability due to lack of proper output escaping of messages.",
  "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Special:Contributions page, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the page. This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites, all within the context of the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.",
  "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a crafted message that is displayed on the Special:Contributions page. The injected script is executed when a user views the affected page.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to create or alter messages that are displayed on the `Special:Contributions` page. The attacker does not need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability, as the XSS happens when any user views a page with the crafted message.",
   "additional_notes": "The fix involves ensuring that messages displayed on Special:Contributions are properly escaped to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.  This vulnerability is addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.31.9 and 1.34.3, and is included in the 1.35.0 release, as well as Fedora 33 update `FEDORA-2020-a4802c53d9`"
