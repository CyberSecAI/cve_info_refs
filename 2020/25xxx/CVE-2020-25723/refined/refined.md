  "CVE-2020-25723": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation of QEMU. It could occur while processing USB requests due to DMA memory map failure not being properly detected. This was fixed in the following commit by checking the return value of usb_packet_map(), thus preventing a reachable assertion issue from occurring in a later call of usb_packet_unmap().",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an improper check of the return value of `usb_packet_map()` during USB request processing in the EHCI controller emulation. A DMA memory map failure was not properly detected leading to a reachable assertion issue in a later call to `usb_packet_unmap()`",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of DMA memory map failure",
      "Reachable assertion in usb_packet_unmap()"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious privileged user within the guest can send bogus USB requests, crashing the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exploitable through the USB EHCI controller emulation, by sending malicious USB requests.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the guest operating system."
