Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue that stems from insufficient input validation on the `filename` parameter within the `AttachmentController.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application allows a user to manipulate the `filename` parameter in a file deletion request. By including directory traversal sequences like `../`, attackers can access and delete files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `filename` parameter is not sanitized or validated, allowing arbitrary file paths to be passed to the deletion function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server accessible to the web application's user, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts the file deletion request and modifies the `filename` parameter to include directory traversal sequences.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed through the web interface, specifically the attachment deletion functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user to access the file deletion feature.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the web application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to modify them.

**Technical Details**

The provided text shows step by step how the vulnerability is exploited.
1.  Deploy the RKCMS locally.
2.  Create a file (e.g. `111.txt`).
3.  Log in to the application.
4.  Capture the attachment delete request.
5.  Modify the `filename` parameter to include `../../../../111.txt`.
6.  Submit the modified request which deletes `111.txt`.

**Additional Notes**

The provided information gives a more detailed view of the exploitation process than a typical CVE description. It includes screenshots of the steps of the exploitation. The source code location `AttachmentController.php` and the lack of filtering of the filename parameter.
