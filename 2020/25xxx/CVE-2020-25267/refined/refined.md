Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25267:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type restrictions in the "Question Pools" feature of the ILIAS learning management system. Although PHP and other common executable file types were blocked, the system failed to prevent the upload of HTML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a stored XSS vulnerability. By uploading a malicious HTML file, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content.
*   **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The system allowed HTML files to be uploaded, even though they could contain active content (JavaScript) that could be abused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Victim's Browser:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of any user who views the affected content.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or credentials, leading to account compromise.
*   **Malicious Redirects/Defacement:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites, deface the user interface or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker may be able to exfiltrate sensitive data available to the user within the application's context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the "Question Pools" feature. Specifically, the attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file containing the malicious JavaScript.
*   **Preview Feature:** The XSS is triggered when a user opens the uploaded HTML file in preview within the "Question Pools" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with "mid-level permissions" capable of creating Question Pools.
*   **File Upload Access:** The attacker requires the ability to upload files within the "Question Pools" functionality.
*   **Awareness of the Preview Functionality:** The attacker must understand that opening the uploaded HTML file in preview will trigger the XSS.
