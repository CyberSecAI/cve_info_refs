Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25768

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject insert tags within front-end forms. These insert tags are then processed and replaced when the page is rendered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insert tag injection in form fields.
-  Unsanitized user input in form fields, specifically with array keys (e.g., `fieldname[]`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary insert tags, leading to various impacts:
-  **Information Disclosure:** Injecting tags to reveal sensitive information processed by the system.
-  **Code Execution:** If insert tags can execute code, this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
-  **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):**  If the injected tags include JavaScript, the attacker could perform XSS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through front-end forms, by submitting specially crafted form data including insert tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with a front-end form.
- No authentication is required based on the description, implying that unauthenticated users could exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the input of the form fields to inject the desired tags.

**Affected Versions:**
The following versions of Contao are affected:
- Contao 4.0
- Contao 4.1
- Contao 4.2
- Contao 4.3
- Contao 4.4 up to 4.4.51
- Contao 4.5
- Contao 4.6
- Contao 4.7
- Contao 4.8
- Contao 4.9 up to 4.9.5
- Contao 4.10 up to 4.10.0

**Suggested Solution:**
Update to one of the following versions:
- Contao 4.4.52
- Contao 4.9.6
- Contao 4.10.1

**Workaround:**
- Disable the front-end login form.
- Avoid using form fields with array keys (e.g., `fieldname[]`).
