Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25498:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is the lack of server-side input validation and client-side filtering for malicious script injection in specific endpoints of the Beetel 777VR1 router's web interface.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts can be injected and stored in the router's configuration through vulnerable endpoints. These scripts are then executed each time a user accesses those endpoints in the admin panel.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious requests that, when triggered by a logged-in user, result in the injection of malicious scripts on the vulnerable endpoints.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Device Takeover:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts through CSRF to take over the device.
*   **Network Compromise:** By taking over the router, an attacker can potentially compromise the entire network connected to it.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** After taking over the device through stored XSS, the attacker could potentially perform any action on behalf of the router administrator, such as changing settings, executing commands, or redirecting traffic.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL with POST Request:** An attacker can send a malicious URL containing a POST request with a crafted payload to exploit the vulnerability via CSRF.
*   **Specific Vulnerable Endpoints:**
    *   NTP Server Name field within the System Time configuration module
    *   Keyword field in the URL Filter endpoint within the Firewall module

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable endpoints and their parameters.
*   **CSRF Exploit:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page containing a CSRF exploit, which includes a POST request to a vulnerable endpoint on the targeted router.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator user to visit or trigger the malicious HTML (e.g., by clicking a link).

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code that demonstrates how to inject malicious script into the "ntpserver" and "ntpserver2" fields of the NTP settings page using a CSRF attack.
*   The PoC also mentions a vulnerability in the URL Filter, suggesting multiple points of injection are possible within the router's web interface.
*   Videos are linked which demonstrate the exploit in the real world (although are not available).
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sayli Ambure (twitter: @sayli_ambure).
