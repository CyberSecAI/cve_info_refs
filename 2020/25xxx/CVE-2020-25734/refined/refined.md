{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the web application allows unauthenticated users to view the directory where files uploaded by authenticated users are stored.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "File Listing Directory: Unauthenticated users can view the list of files uploaded by authenticated users.",
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can view the filenames of uploaded files, which can be leveraged to create a remote shell by combining it with the file upload vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated user can directly access the directory listing page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires no authentication and can be in any position where they can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server."
