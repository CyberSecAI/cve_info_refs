Moshe Kol and Shlomi Oberman of JSOF discovered several
vulnerabilities in dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP
server. They could result in denial of service, cache poisoning or the
execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.80-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.

# DNSpooq - Kaminsky attack is back!

### 7 new vulnerabilities are being disclosed in common DNS software dnsmasq, reminiscent of 2008 weaknesses in Internet DNS Architecture

## Overview- DNSpooq

### Vulnerabilities threaten DNS integrity (again)

The JSOF research labs are reporting 7 vulnerabilities found in *dnsmasq*, an open-source DNS forwarding software in common use. Dnsmasq is very popular, and we have identified approximately 40 vendors whom we believe use dnsmasq in their products, as well as major Linux distributions.

The DNS protocol has a history of vulnerabilities dating back to the famous 2008 Kaminsky attack. Nevertheless, a large part of the Internet still relies on DNS as a source of integrity, in the same way it has for over a decade, and is therefore exposed to attacks that can endanger the integrity of parts of the web.

### DNSpooq

The Dnspooq vulnerabilities include DNS cache poisoning vulnerabilities as well as a potential Remote code execution and others. The list of devices using dnsmasq is long and varied. According to our internet-based research, prominent users of dnsmasq seem to include Cisco routers, Android phones, Aruba devices, Technicolor, and Red-Hat, as well as Siemens, Ubiquiti networks, Comcast, and others listed below. Depending on how they use dnsmasq, devices may be more or less affected, or not affected at all.

The origin of the name DNSpooq is a merge of 3 elements: DNS spoofing, the idea of a spook spying on Internet traffic, and the ‘q’ at the end of dnsmasq, replacing the ‘k’ of spook with a ‘q’. The spy or spook graphic illustrates the effects of an effective DNS spoofing on the ability to spy on internet traffic. The JSOF-pink glasses show how looking through tainted glasses, or a compromised middleman may alter your perception of the reality.

DNSpooq demonstrates that DNS implementations are still insecure, even today, 13 years after the last major attack was described.

Given the vulnerabilities in DNS over the years, you would think that the security-enhancement mechanisms that have been developed in response,  would be ubiquitous by now. However, in reality, DNSSEC is still not very widely deployed, and neither is HSTS. For example, according to research from 2017, adoption of HSTS among the 1M most popular websites [was only at about 5%](https://www.cs.umd.edu/sites/default/files/scholarly_papers/Petrov%2C%20Ivan_1801.pdf)). According to some rough estimates performed by JSOF with the help of large Internet companies, and matching external sources, around [15-20% of Internet traffic](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/keeping-up-with-performance-demands-of-encrypted-web-traffic) is still completely unencrypted, and users still click through to insecure websites.

### History

In 2008, well-known security researcher Dan Kaminsky found and disclosed a fundamental flaw in the Internet naming scheme that affected the most common DNS software and the integrity of the way the Internet worked at the time.

Kaminsky proved that attackers can impersonate any website name and steal data. (This has since become known as the “Kaminsky Attack”).

DNS has been considered a somewhat insecure protocol for decades, ever since the Kaminsky disclosure and even before that, though it is assumed to guarantee a certain level of integrity. This is the reason it is still heavily relied upon. At the same time, mechanisms have been developed to improve the security of the original DNS protocol. These mechanisms include HTTPS, HSTS, DNSSEC, and other initiatives. Browsers also try to increase users awareness by alerting them before accessing insecure sites with messages such as [“Your Connection is Not Private”](https://www.pandasecurity.com/en/mediacenter/panda-security/your-connection-is-not-private/).

![](https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DNSpooq-IMG1-1024x350.png)

Nevertheless, even with all these mechanisms in place, a DNS hijack is still a dangerous attack in 2021. A large part of the Internet still relies on DNS in a similar manner as in 2008, and is exposed to attacks of the same types.

##

## Impact

The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:

1. **DNS cache poisoning attacks**, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.
2. **Buffer overflow vulnerabilities** that could lead to remote code execution.

**(1)** **DNS Cache Poisoning:** The impact of DNS cache poisoning of the routing equipment DNS forwarding server can potentially lead to different kinds of fraud if users believe they are browsing to one website but are actually routed to another.

Traffic that might be subverted includes regular Internet browsing as well as other types of traffic, such as emails, SSH, remote desktop, RDP video and voice calls, software updates, and so on. Some of these protocols have built-in measures to mitigate this type of attack, with varying degrees of effectiveness and so YMMV (Your mileage may vary).

### **DNS Cache Poisoning**

![](https://www.jsof-tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/תמונה6.png)

**(2) Device take over:** In addition to cache poisoning, every device on which an attacker can perform DNS cache poisoning can also potentially be taken over by the attacker. For example, in the case of a router, the attacker would then have complete control over all traffic going in and out of the network.

There are additional impacts possible for these types of attacks. ***These are hypotheticals***, since to our knowledge they have never been performed by a malicious actor in this way, but they are a definite possibility if the vulnerabilities are exploited correctly. Even so, given the hypothetical nature of the situation, it is hard to analyze how likely they are to actually occur and what value they could bring to different malicious actors. These possibilities include:
**(A) Massive DDOS**: Diversion of a large amount of web-traffic to an attacker-controlled website could be used to generate massive JavaScript-fueled Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Simplistic calculations show that the size of the attack could be on the same order of magnitude as the biggest DDOS attacks performed to date.

**Massive DDOS

**(B) Reverse DDOS**: Prevention of certain users from accessing a website and logging of access attempts to a domain.

### Reverse DDOS

**(C)** “**Semi-******Wormable**” **attacks****: In situations where a mobile device moves between networks, the attack may be semi-wormable. It is not wormable in the traditional sense, since there are some pre-conditions and efforts needed on the attacker side for the exploit replication, but is semi-wormable in the sense that the exploit can continue to spread between vulnerable devices without explicit user interaction and without need for additional attacker access. In this scenario, a mobile device that was previously browsing in a network which uses an infected dnsmasq server receives a bad DNS record. When the device reaches a new network, it could infect the new network as well.

### Wormable Attacks

## Technical Overview

**Below are high-level technical details of the Vulnerabilities. For in depth information, please refer to our [technical whitepaper](https://www.jsof-tech.com/dnspooq-technical-wp/).**

## Terminology

DNS: DNS (Domain Name System) is an addressing system used in order to reach a domain. A name such as ‘[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)’ would be mapped to an IP address. The DNS protocol is based on *queries*asking where an address is located and *responses*containing an IP address. This is a basic feature of the Internet and is used by almost all computer software.

Dnsmasq: Dnsmasq is a popular software used for caching of DNS responses. Storing the responses to previously asked DNS queries locally speeds up the DNS resolution process.

The software is installed on many home and commercial routers and servers in many organizations. Dnsmasq is used heavily by networking equipment, as well as being set up manually by IT personnel, usually in smaller networks. There are other uses of dnsmasq, such as providing DNS services to support Wi-Fi hot-spots, enterprise guest networks, virtualization, ad blocking, implementing a captive portal – the login screen that appears when logging in to a network in an airport or other public location and other use cases.

The DNSpooq vulnerability set divides into 2 types of vulnerabilities:

1. **DNS cache poisoning attacks**, similar to the Kaminsky attack, but different in some aspects.
2. **Buffer overflow vulnerabilities** that could lead to remote code execution.

### Cache Poisoning Vulnerabilities

This type of attack allows subverting of DNS queries in an organization or device using dnsmasq. Essentially, this means that an attacker will be able to reroute communications made by a specific target that relies on a website name such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

These vulnerabilities are similar to the *SAD DNS* attacks reported recently by researchers at UC Riverside and Tsinghua University. SAD DNS also affect dnsmasq and other prevalent DNS software. The SAD DNS and DNSpooq vulnerabilities can also be combined to make attacks even easier. Additional attacks with unclear implications were also reported by a joint effort of universities ([Poison Over Troubled Forwarders](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/zheng#:~:text=Conference%20Policies-,Poison%20Over%20Troubled%20Forwarders%3A%20A%20Cache%20Poisoning%20Attack%20Targeting%20DNS,American%2C%20and%20African%20Diaspora%20Inclusion.) and others).

The DNSpooq cache poisoning vulnerabilities are labeled:

The vulnerabilities work by reducing the entropy of the TXID and source port. They should be randomized and provide 32 bits of entropy, however, due to the use of a weak hash to identify the DNS requests and a loose matching of request to response, the entropy can be greatly reduced and only ~19 bits need to be guessed, making cache poisoning very feasible. The way that dnsmasq treats CNAME records further allows to spoof a chain of CNAME records and effectively poison 9 DNS records at the same time. To execute the attack a suitable setup must be set in place by the attacker, which is not difficult to perform. For the cache poisoning, devices that do not use the cache feature of Dnsmasq will be much less affected (but not completely immune).

For more detailed technical information, refer to the [technical whitepaper](https://www.jsof-tech.com/dnspooq-technical-wp/).

### Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities

The 4 buffer overflow vulnerabilities that are a part of DNSpooq have a different effect. The worst of these vulnerabilities could lead to a remote code execution on the vulnerable device. These vulnerabilities, in and of themselves, would pose only limited risk. But they become especially powerful since they can be combined with the cache-poisoning vulnerabilities to produce a more potent attack.

These vulnerabilities are labeled:

The buffer overflow vulnerabilities include a high severity heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that could potentially lead to remote code execution when dnsmasq is configured to use DNSSEC. The vulnerability resides in the early stages of DNSSEC validation, rendering DNSSEC’s defense against DNS attacks ineffective. We have not attempted full exploitation of this vulnerability. Other vulnerabilities we found are heap-based buffer overflows that can only lead to denial-of-service when DNSSEC is used.

For the Buffer Overflows and Remote Code execution, devices that don’t use the DNSSEC feature will be immune. DNSSEC is a security feature meant to prevent cache poisoning attacks and so we would not recommend turning it off, but rather updating to the newest version of dnsmasq.

For more detailed technical information, refer to the [technical whitepaper](https://www.jsof-tech.com/dnspooq-technical-wp/).

### A combination with Impact

One of the interesting things about these vulnerabilities is that each one of them, on its own, has limited impact. However, the vulnerabilities could be combined and chained in certain ways to build extremely effective multi-staged attacks. This is because exploiting some of the vulnerabilities makes it easier to exploit others. For example, we found that combining CVE-2020-25682, CVE-2020-25684, and CVE-2020-25686 would result in CVE-2020-25682 having a lower attack complexity (with the same impact) and result in a combined CVSS of 9.8 according to our analysis (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H ).

Combining the vulnerabilities found by JSOF with other recently-disclosed network attacks could potentially lead to much easier and more widespread attack possibilities, an area of research which can be explored further. This includes vulnerabilities such as [NAT-slipstreaming](https://samy.pl/slipstream/), found by Samy Kamkar, [SAD DNS](https://www.saddns.net/), found by researchers at University of California Riverside, and the lack of destination-side source address validation as found by [researchers at Brigham Young University](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/articles/360055856934-Destination-Side-Source-Address-Validation-Reports-from-BYU), as well as other academic research on DNS.

### Vulnerabilities List

| **Name** | **CVSS** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CVE-2020-25681** | 8.1 | Dnsmasq versions before 2.83are susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow in sort\_rrset() when DNSSEC is used. This can allow a remote attacker to write arbitrary data into target device’s memory that can lead to memory corruption and other unexpected behaviors on the target device. |
| **CVE-2020-25682** | 8.1 | Dnsmasq versions before 2.83 are susceptible to buffer overflow in extract\_name() function due to missing length check, when DNSSEC is enabled. This can allow a remote attacker to cause memory corruption on the target device. |
| **CVE-2020-25683** | 5.9 | Dnsmasq versions before 2.83 are susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow when DNSSEC is enabled. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract\_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in get\_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a Denial of Service. |
| **CVE-2020-25687** | 5.9 | Dnsmasq versions before 2.83are vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow with large memcpy in sort\_rrset() when DNSSEC is enabled. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract\_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort\_rrset() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a Denial of Service. |
| **CVE-2020-25684** | 4 | A lack of proper address/port check implemented in dnsmasq versions < 2.83 reply\_query function makes it easier to forge replies to an off-path attacker. |
| **CVE-2020-25685** | 4 | A lack of query resource name (RRNAME) checks implemented in dnsmasq’s versions before 2.83 reply\_query function allows remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic that can lead to DNS cache poisoning. |
| **CVE-2020-25686** | 4 | Multiple DNS query requests for the same resource name (RRNAME) by dnsmasq versions before 2.83 allows for remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic, using a birthday attack (RFC 5452), that can lead to DNS cache poisoning. |

## Vendors

Some of the bigger users of dnsmasq to our understanding and according to our internet research are Android/Google, Comcast, Cisco, Redhat, netgear, and Ubiquiti. There are many more. Different vendors use it for different purposes. Some vendor configurations may not be vulnerable. The following table provides examples of over 40 companies and respective products we believe are using dnsmasq, together with the relevant sources that led us to this understanding.

## Attack Scenarios

There are several possible attack scenarios, depending on the device configuration. These include:

* **Open forwarders:** For the approximately 1 million dnsmasq servers openly visible on the Internet (according to [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=dnsmasq)), attacks through the Internet are very simple. This may be possible in some cases, (we believe rare), even if the forwarder is not open to the Internet.
* **Closed network with internal attacker:** If a dnsmasq server is only configured to listen to connections received from within an internal network, and an attacker gains a foothold on any device in the network, the attacker would be able to perform the attack.
* **Browser-based attack:** This variation of the attack is more complex to pull off but *is much more dangerous*, since the attack can be performed with only a basic level of access. Even if a dnsmasq server is closed off to the outside world, and is only configured to listen to connection received from within an internal network, if attackers are able to get a device within the network to browse to their website, they could perform the attack this way. This includes cases where only a part of the website is crafted by the attacker, such as if the attacker were able to display crafted ads in a victim’s browser through an ad network. This version of the attack is more complex, may take some time, may have lower success rates, and will not work on every browser. For example, this method has been tested and shown to work on an iPhone with built-in Safari, working on a single device. It did not work in Chrome running on Windows. We have not completed extensive tests, but believe that Chrome is probably immune. Chromium-base browsers and Microsoft browsers were not tested.
* **Open Wi-Fi or wired network:** If a dnsmasq server is only configured to listen to connections received from within an internal network but the network is open, such as an airport network or a corporate guest network, an attacker will be able to perform the attack.

## Disclosure

The story of **DNSpooq** begins in the summer of 2020, when we began researching dnsmasq vulnerabilities. We identified some vulnerabilities and moved forward to reproduce them under different configurations. Once we validated the vulnerabilities, we kicked off a coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process. Given how dependent the Internet is on DNS technology, and how widespread dnsmasq, is we certainly believe the situation is of high importance to home users and enterprises.

The disclosure started on August 2020 and the Embargo ended on January 2021, marking approximately 5 months in total of Coordination of the vulnerabilities.

With the help of CERT/CC and volunteers from several companies, a working group was formed, combining the expertise and extended reach of members from JSOF, CERT/CC, Cisco, Google, Red Hat, Pi-hole, and Simon Kelley, the maintainer of dnsmasq, to ensure that the DNSpooq vulnerabilities would be effectively fixed and well documented and communicated.

Since we are coordinated DNSpooq through CERT/CC, we do not have direct visibility into what the various vendors will decide to do, in terms of integrating patches and fixes to their customers. Generally, we believe the major OS distributors and vendors will issue patches simultaneously, and the other vendors publish updates soon afterwards.

## Mitigation and Workarounds

While several workarounds exist, and are documented in our [technical whitepaper](https://www.jsof-tech.com/dnspooq-technical-wp/), the best and only full mitigation is to update dnsmasq to version 2.83 or above.

## Summary

DNSpooq is a series of vulnerabilities found in the ubiquitous open-source software dnsmasq, demonstrating that DNS is still insecure, 13 years after the last major attack was described.

Some of the DNSpooq vulnerabilities allow for DNS cache poisoning and one of the DNSpooq vulnerabilities could permit a potential Remote Code execution that could allow a takeover of many brands of home routers and other networking equipment, with millions of devices affected, and over a million instances directly exposed to the Internet.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-2e4c3d5a9d
2021-02-20 01:33:46.075545
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.84
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-23 15:24:28 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way dnsmasq extract names from DNS packets before validating them with DNSSEC data. An attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow with arbitrary data in a heap-allocated memory, possibly executing code on the machine. The flaw is in rfc1035.c:extract_name() function, which writes data to the memory pointed by `name` assuming MAXDNAME*2 bytes are available in the buffer. However, in some code execution paths it is possible extract_name() gets passed an offset from the base buffer, thus reducing in practice the number of available bytes that can be written in the buffer.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-11-04 13:50:03 UTC  ``` To trigger the flaw, dnsmasq has to be compiled with HAVE_DNSSEC flag and DNSSEC has to be enabled (e.g. with --dnssec option). Moreover, the attacker shall either control a DNS server used in the domain name resolution process or be able to inject packets on the network in such a way to trick dnsmasq into accepting them (e.g. guessing the ID, random port used, etc.). To be involved in the domain name resolution process, an attacker could trick a victim which uses dnsmasq into accessing some resources on a controlled domain, e.g. trick the user to visit a website or open an email. If the dnsmasq service is an Open Resolver (it accepts requests from the whole Internet) or the attacker is on the internal network covered by dnsmasq, the attack can be performed at will by the attacker, without requiring any other user interaction.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c18)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 11:30:12 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Moshe Kol (JSOF), Shlomi Oberman (JSOF)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 11:30:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of dnsmasq as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 as they are not compiled with DNSSEC support.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 11:30:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.jsof-tech.com/disclosures/dnspooq/>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c21)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 11:30:22 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The only known way to mitigate this flaw is to disable DNSSEC altogether, by removing the `--dnssec` command line option or the `dnssec` option from dnsmasq configuration file.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c22)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 11:56:26 UTC  ``` Created dnsmasq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1917782](show_bug.cgi?id=1917782 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25682 dnsmasq: buffer overflow in extract_name() due to missing length check when DNSSEC is enabled [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-19 13:11:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2021:0152 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0152](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0152)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-19 13:16:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:0150 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0150](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0150)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c26)  Riccardo Schirone    2021-01-19 13:22:15 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=commit;h=4e96a4be685c9e4445f6ee79ad0b36b9119b502a>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-01-19 13:34:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2021:0151 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0151](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0151)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1882014#c28)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-01-19 17:59:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-84440e87ba
2021-01-21 01:44:43.057749
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 2.83
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
