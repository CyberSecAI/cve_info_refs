  "CVE-2020-25682": {
    "description": "The provided documents describe a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `extract_name()` function of dnsmasq, a lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server. This vulnerability is triggered when DNSSEC is enabled.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a missing length check in the `extract_name()` function when processing DNS packets. The function assumes a fixed buffer size (MAXDNAME*2) but doesn't validate if the available space is actually that much, leading to a potential overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing length check"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause memory corruption on the target device, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service. This is especially critical when combined with other related vulnerabilities like cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted DNS responses",
      "Network injection"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted DNS replies to the dnsmasq server. This can be achieved by controlling a DNS server used by the target, by injecting packets on the network, or via a browser based attack if the target browses a malicious webpage. The attacker needs to guess or control certain aspects of the DNS communication like transaction IDs (TXID) and source ports, although the entropy may be reduced due to the way dnsmasq handles DNS requests and responses.",
     "affected_configurations": [
       "dnsmasq with DNSSEC enabled"
        ]
