Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `chroothole_client` executable, which is designed to allow communication between the chrooted environment and the host OS. It calls a PHP script for system configuration. However, the `chroothole_client` does not properly sanitize the path provided for the PHP script, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code with root privileges by specifying a path to a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Insecure Chroot Escape Mechanism:** The `chroothole_client` intended to provide a controlled channel for specific commands but failed to validate the path passed to the PHP interpreter.
2. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary PHP code allows for any malicious code to be executed on the system.
3. **Root Privilege Escalation:** The PHP script execution occurs with root privileges, allowing full control over the system.
4. **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability is a direct result of the missing validation of user-supplied file paths before being passed to the underlying php interpreter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the system
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Ability to execute arbitrary commands
- The ability to create a backdoor for persistence
- The ability to change or destroy data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the Ucopia's CLI using the `chroothole_client`.
- An attacker must have authenticated access to the CLI with the `admin` user. While the `admin` user is intended to be a privileged user, the default password is known, and even when the password is changed via the web interface, the CLI password remains as the default.
- The attacker then uses the `scp` command to upload a malicious PHP file to the `~/data/` directory.
- The attacker constructs a `chroothole_client` command that calls the php interpreter with the absolute path to the previously uploaded malicious php file.
- The php file is executed with root privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have network access to the Ucopia device's CLI interface.
- Attacker must have the default administrative password to log into the CLI.
- Attacker needs to know the path for the chroot directory, but this can be discovered using `status` command.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the available commands, `scp` for file transfer, and the `chroothole_client` for arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, outlining the specific steps to exploit the vulnerability.
- The blog post also discusses other vulnerabilities, CVE-2020-25036 which allows to escape the CLI environment through the `less` command and CVE-2020-25037, which is related to arbitrary code execution through the `host` command.
- The blog post also contains a clear description of the steps for discovery, analysis and exploitation of the vulnerability.
