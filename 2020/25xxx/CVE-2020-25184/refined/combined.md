Xylem Product Security Advisory

Rockwell ISaGRAF Runtime vulnerabilities for Flygt MultiSmart

June 8, 2021

Overview & Impact

Rockwell Automation recently announced security vulnerabilities which impact ISaGRAF
Runtime v5.x, which is a feature that can be enabled in the Flygt MultiSmart pump station
management system.

These vulnerabilities in Rockwell Automation’s software do not affect most MultiSmart
devices.

However, MultiSmart Gen-1 devices and MultiSmart Gen-2 devices running firmware prior to
version 3.2.0 contain a version of ISaGRAF 5.x. If ISaGRAF is enabled on those device, then
they might be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Users may refer to the MultiSmart Technical Product Information to determine their firmware
version (see Section 6.2.4 of the Installation, Operations, and Maintenance Manual). That
documentation also provides guidance on enabling and disabling the ISaGRAF feature (see
Section 6.2.5.40 of the Installation, Operations, and Maintenance Manual).

Certain pump operation architectures with MultiSmart are vulnerable if the ISaGRAF feature is
enabled, and could allow unauthorized users to read, download, or delete content from the
device.  Please refer to the recommendations in the mitigation section below to reduce the risk
of these vulnerabilities.

MultiSmart devices are NOT affected by the vulnerabilities if:

  They were purchased in the last 7 years (since 2014).
  They are running firmware versions 3.2.0 or later.
  The ISaGRAF feature has not been enabled. (It is disabled by default.)

Affected Products and Versions

ISaGRAF Runtime v5.x

  MultiSmart Gen-1 devices
  MultiSmart Gen-2 devices running firmware versions prior to 3.2.0

Mitigation

Upgrade MultiSmart firmware to version 3.2.0 or later. (Recommended for all MultiSmart Gen-2
devices.)

  Please refer to the MultiSmart release notes located on the Technical Product

Information site for instructions on how to upgrade the firmware. (See Section 8.1 of the
Installation, Operations, and Maintenance Manual.)

When applicable, upgrade the unit to the latest hardware.

  Users of Gen-1 devices should consider upgrading to Gen-2 devices.
  Please consult with Xylem’s Flygt Transport Team for assistance with upgrading the

hardware.

Xylem also recommends a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy to reduce the risk of these
vulnerabilities.  This means employing adequate network segmentation and security controls
including, but not limited to:

  Restricting network connections and confirming the devices are not accessible from the

Internet.

  Harden workstations that connect to the MultiSmart devices (e.g., maintain Endpoint

Detection & Response solutions, application whitelisting, remove administrative rights).
  Ensuring control devices are behind firewalls and isolated from the enterprise/business

network or any other wide-area network.

  Continuously monitor affected devices for security events that could warn of attempted

unauthorized use.

  Strictly managing remote access and any privileged access to all devices that can

connect to the MultiSmart.
