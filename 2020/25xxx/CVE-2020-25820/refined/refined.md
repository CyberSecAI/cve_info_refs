  "CVE-2020-25820": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of XML Linking Language (XLink) within Open Document Format (ODF) files, which are processed by LibreOffice during document conversion in BigBlueButton. When a malicious ODF file contains XLinks that reference local files or remote URLs, LibreOffice will embed the contents of those files or the responses from the remote URLs into the converted PDF, which then becomes accessible to the presentation viewer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Disclosure: The system processes ODF files without properly sanitizing or restricting XLink references, allowing an attacker to include references to local files on the server.",
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The system also fails to prevent XLink references to external URLs, enabling an attacker to force the server to make arbitrary requests to other servers or services."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to upload presentations can:\n\n*   Read arbitrary files from the BigBlueButton server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration files containing API keys and credentials.\n*   Perform server-side requests to internal network resources or external sites.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the uploading of a crafted ODF file (such as a .odt file) that contains malicious XLink references to local files (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`) or to external URLs (e.g., `http://example.com`).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to a BigBlueButton conference and the ability to upload presentations. This level of access is typically granted to presenters or moderators."
