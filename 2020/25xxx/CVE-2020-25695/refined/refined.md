Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-25695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple features within PostgreSQL failed to properly enforce the "security restricted operation" sandbox. This means certain operations that should have been confined by security restrictions were able to bypass those restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** The primary vulnerability lies in the inadequate separation of privileges. Users with the ability to create non-temporary objects in a schema could execute arbitrary SQL functions with the elevated privileges of a superuser. This implies that the "security restricted operation" sandbox did not effectively prevent actions outside the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL functions as a superuser.
- **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data can occur.
- **Data Integrity Violation:** Data can be modified or corrupted without authorization.
- **System Availability Disruption:**  The vulnerability can be used to cause a denial-of-service condition by executing malicious code, leading to system unavailability.
- **Privilege Escalation**: A low privilege user can escalate to a superuser, gaining full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Access:** The attacker requires access to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Object Creation Permission:** The attacker must have the permission to create non-temporary objects within at least one schema.
- **SQL Injection:** Arbitrary SQL functions can be executed via the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A user with the ability to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema is required.
- The attacker must be able to connect to the database server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in PostgreSQL versions prior to 13.1, 12.5, 11.10, 10.15, 9.6.20, and 9.5.24.
- Mitigation steps included disabling autovacuum and avoiding manual execution of ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, VACUUM FULL, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, or restores from pg_dump, however, this was not a fix but a workaround with performance implications.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a high severity issue, according to both Red Hat and NetApp.
- The vulnerability was fixed in multiple releases including postgresql 13.1, 12.5, 11.10, 10.15, 9.6.20, 9.5.24
-  The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202012-07 lists this vulnerability along with CVE-2020-25694 and CVE-2020-25696.
-  The Debian Security Advisory DLA-2478-1 also includes this vulnerability alongside CVE-2020-25694 and CVE-2020-25696.
-  NetApp states that they were aware of public discussion of this vulnerability, but none of their products were affected.
