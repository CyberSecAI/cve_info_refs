| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1886936#c0)  Marco Benatto    2020-10-09 18:56:26 UTC  ``` grub_usb_device_initialize() is called to handle USB device initialization. it reads out the descriptors it needs from the USB device and uses that data to fill in some USB data structures. grub_usb_device_initialize() performs very little bounds checking and simply assumes the USB device provides sane values. This behavior can trigger memory corruption. If properly exploited, this would lead to arbitrary code execution allowing the attacker to by-pass SecureBoot mechanism.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1886936#c2)  Marco Benatto    2020-12-29 14:56:58 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joseph Tartaro (IOActive), Ilja van Sprundel (IOActive)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1886936#c6)  Marco Benatto    2021-02-25 15:34:43 UTC  ``` Marking fwupdate as WONTFIX for all rhel8 streams.
