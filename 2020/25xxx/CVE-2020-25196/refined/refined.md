Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25196:

**CVE-2020-25196: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts**

*   **Root Cause:** The built-in web server allows SSH/Telnet sessions without proper restrictions on the number of authentication attempts.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of rate limiting or lockout mechanisms for failed login attempts on SSH/Telnet interfaces.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can perform brute-force attacks to bypass authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device. This can lead to complete compromise of the device.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks targeting the SSH/Telnet interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the device and has to initiate SSH/Telnet connections. No prior authentication is needed.
