- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sending specially crafted packets to TCP port 102 of affected Siemens SIMATIC NET CP 343-1 devices can cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial-of-service condition on affected devices, requiring a cold restart to recover.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted network packets to TCP port 102.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected devices on port 102. No authentication or user interaction is required.
