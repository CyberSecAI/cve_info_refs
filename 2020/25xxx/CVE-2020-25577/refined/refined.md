{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "rtsold(8) failed to perform sufficient bounds checking on the extent of the RDNSS and DNSSL options. It does not verify that the option does not extend past the end of the received packet before processing its contents.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient bounds checking on the extent of the RDNSS and DNSSL options.",
    "Improper validation of label lengths in DNSSL options leading to buffer overflow."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "It is believed that these bugs could be exploited to gain remote code execution within the rtsold(8) daemon, which runs as root. On FreeBSD 12.2, rtsold(8) runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which would limit the scope of a compromised process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malformed Router Advertisement messages containing crafted RDNSS or DNSSL options to a vulnerable rtsold(8) daemon. The attacker needs to be on the same physical link as the interface on which rtsold(8) is listening.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the same physical link as the interface(s) on which rtsold(8) is listening. No authentication or authorization is required."
