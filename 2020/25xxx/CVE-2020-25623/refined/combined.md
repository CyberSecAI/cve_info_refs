### Download Erlang/OTP

The latest version of Erlang/OTP is [27.2](/patches/OTP-27.2). To install Erlang you can either build it [from source](#source) or use a [pre-built package](#prebuilt).

Take a look at the [Erlang/OTP 27 release description](/downloads/27) to see what changes Erlang/OTP 27 brings over the previous major version.

The Erlang/OTP version scheme is described in the [Erlang/OTP Systems Principles Guide](/doc/system/versions#version-scheme).

### Compiling Erlang from source [#](#source)

You can build Erlang from source on your own, following the [building and installation instructions](/doc/system/install). In a nutshell to install a pre-built archive you need only do:

```
./configure && make && make install

```

If you clone the release from git, there may be some additional steps needed depending on which version of Erlang/OTP you are compiling. So always make sure to read the build and install instruction of the release you are compiling.

You can also use third-party tools such as [Kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl), [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/erlang.html) to compile Erlang. They help to remove the differences between Erlang/OTP releases and the OS you are compiling on.

### Pre-built Binary Packages [#](#prebuilt)

Most OS package managers provide pre-built binary packages.

* For Homebrew on macOS: `brew install erlang`
* For MacPorts on macOS: `port install erlang`
* For Ubuntu and Debian: `apt-get install erlang`
* For Fedora: `dnf install erlang`
* For ArchLinux and Manjaro: `pacman -S erlang`
* For FreeBSD: `pkg install erlang`

The OS provided packages tend to not contain the latest version of Erlang/OTP.
So [Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/) provides up to date pre-built packages for the latest stable releases. Erlang Solutions provides pre-built binary packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS and other operating systems.

[OTP-23.1](/erlang/otp/tree/OTP-23.1)

[`1b5dce9`](/erlang/otp/commit/1b5dce9313e29c320593b3bba5ca020a23019706)

Erlang/OTP 23.1 is the first maintenance patch release for OTP 23, with mostly bug fixes as well as a few improvements.

### Vulnerability fix

A vulnerability in the httpd module (inets application) regarding directory traversal that was introduced in OTP 22.3.1 and corrected in OTP 22.3.4.6. It was also introduced in OTP 23.0 and corrected in OTP 23.1 The vulnerability is registered as [CVE-2020-25623](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xm5m-7wr8-cvwh "CVE-2020-25623").

The vulnerability is only exposed if the http server (httpd) in the inets application is used. The vulnerability makes it possible to read arbitrary files which the Erlang system has read access to with for example a specially prepared http request.

### General build issues

* Adjust /bin/sh to /system/bin/sh in scripts when installing on Android.
* Changes in build system to make it build for macOS 11.0 with Apple Silicon. Also corrected execution of match specs to work on Apple Silicon.

A full list of bug fixes and improvements in the [readme](http://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.README).
