Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in the `httpd` module of the `inets` application within Erlang/OTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The `httpd` module improperly handles crafted HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: A successful exploit allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that the Erlang system has read access to. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted HTTP Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially prepared HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable Erlang/OTP instance is running.
- Knowledge of Vulnerability: The attacker needs to be aware of the directory traversal vulnerability in the `httpd` module to craft the malicious HTTP requests.

**Affected Versions:**
- Erlang/OTP versions 22.3.x before 22.3.4.6
- Erlang/OTP versions 23.x before 23.1

**Patched Versions:**
- Erlang/OTP 22.3.4.6
- Erlang/OTP 23.1
