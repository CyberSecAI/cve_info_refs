  "CVE-2020-25671": {
    "description": "kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free. A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.\n\nNadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could result in use-after-free and double-free. This has also been fixed.",
    "root_cause": "A reference counting bug in the `llcp_sock_connect()` function of the NFC LLCP implementation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Reference count leak leading to potential UAF"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local user interaction with the NFC LLCP implementation.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user capable of interacting with the NFC subsystem"
