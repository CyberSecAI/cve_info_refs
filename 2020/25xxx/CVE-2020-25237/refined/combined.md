SSA-156833: Zip-Slip Directory Traversal Vulnerability in SINEMA
Server and SINEC NMS

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.8

V1.0

SUMMARY

There exists a directory traversal vulnerability which allows arbitrary ﬁle upload to an affected system. This
type of vulnerability is also known as ‘Zip-Slip’. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
gain arbitrary code execution by uploading a new or modifying an existing ﬁle to an affected system.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected components to trusted personnel.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25237

When uploading ﬁles to an affected system using a zip container, the system does not correctly check
if the relative ﬁle path of the extracted ﬁles is still within the intended target directory. With this an
attacker could create or overwrite arbitrary ﬁles on an affected system. This type of vulnerability is
also known as ‘Zip-Slip’. (ZDI-CAN-12054)
