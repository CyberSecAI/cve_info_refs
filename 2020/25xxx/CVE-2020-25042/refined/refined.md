The provided content describes a vulnerability in Mara CMS 7.5, but it is not associated with CVE-2020-25042. The content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper file extension checks during file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The CMS allows users to upload files without validating the file extension.
- Authenticated RCE: Attackers with valid admin or manager credentials can upload a malicious PHP file (webshell) and execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain remote code execution on the server, potentially leading to:
- Full control of the web server.
- Data theft.
- System compromise.
- Further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the Mara CMS web application.
- The attacker needs to access the file upload functionality, which is located at `http://target/codebase/dir.php?type=filenew`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid admin or manager credentials to log into the Mara CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application.
