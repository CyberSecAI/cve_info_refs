Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25716:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-10783. The initial fix for CVE-2020-10783 only addressed the issue for the `EVM-Operator` group, leaving other groups vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Role-based privilege escalation:** An attacker with a specific group (other than `EVM-Operator`, which was addressed by the initial CVE-2020-10783 fix) can perform actions restricted to the `EVM-Super-administrator` group.
- This allows for the export or import of administrator files, which should only be possible by a system administrator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data confidentiality and integrity:**  The vulnerability poses a high threat to data confidentiality and integrity. Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or modification of critical system settings through imported files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Cloudforms web interface or API, where an authenticated user belonging to a vulnerable group can perform privileged actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with membership in a specific group that is not the `EVM-Operator` group, as this group's vulnerability was addressed by a previous fix.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the Cloudforms interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug report indicates that Cloudforms versions 4.7 and 5 are affected.
- The issue was resolved in CloudForms Management Engine 5.11.10.1.
- The fix is available in RHSA-2020:5554
- The vulnerability was discovered by Purnachand Pulahari (IBM) and Ranjit Kumar Singh (IBM).
