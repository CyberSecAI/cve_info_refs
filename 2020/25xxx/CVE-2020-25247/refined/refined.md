Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Hyland OnBase server fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the server concatenates user input directly into local file system calls without proper validation or escaping. This lack of input sanitization leads to path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: Attackers can read and write arbitrary files on the server by manipulating file paths within SOAP calls to vulnerable methods.
- Improper input sanitization: The server does not properly sanitize or escape user input before using it in file system calls. This lack of input validation is the root cause of the path traversal vulnerability.
- Read-only and write/append-only instances: The vulnerability is present in multiple instances, some allowing read-only access and others allowing write or append-only access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file read: Attackers can read configuration data and other arbitrary files from the server.
- Arbitrary file write/append: Attackers can create, append to, and write arbitrary files on the server, potentially allowing them to upload malicious DLLs or backdoors.
- Full system compromise: The ability to read and write arbitrary files can lead to a full system compromise if the attacker gains sufficient control over the file system and can execute malicious files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- SOAP calls: Attackers send specifically crafted SOAP calls to the server, targeting vulnerable methods that utilize the "FileName" parameter and other vulnerable parameters.
- Direct file system access via path manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: Attackers must have network access to the Hyland OnBase server to send SOAP calls.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable methods and parameters.
- Possibly require some privileges to trigger the write access, while read access seems to be available to basic users.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in all versions of OnBase up to and prior to OnBase Foundation EP1 (tested: 19.8.9.1000) and OnBase 18 (tested: 18.0.0.32).
*   The vendor, Hyland, was reportedly unresponsive to the reported vulnerability and has not provided a fix.
*   The write access is limited to the current `resourcePath` and if this is on a separate partition from the binaries, it will limit the exploitability.
* There is an associated read-only path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2020-25248), that seems to be more easily exploitable.
