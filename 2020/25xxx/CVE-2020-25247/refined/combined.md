# Hyland OnBase 19.x and below - Path Traversal

---

*From*: AdaptiveSecurity Consulting via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

```
CVSSv3.1 Score
-------------------------------------------------
AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Vendor
-------------------------------------------------
Hyland Software - (<https://www.hyland.com/en/> and <https://www.onbase.com/en/>)

Product
-------------------------------------------------
Hyland OnBase
All derivatives based on OnBase

Versions Affected
-------------------------------------------------
All versions up to and prior to OnBase Foundation EP1 (tested: 19.8.9.1000) and OnBase 18 (tested: 18.0.0.32). OnBase
Foundation EP2 and OnBase Foundation EP3 were not available to test, but Hyland's response indicates that they are not
likely to have fixed the vulnerabilities.

Credit
-------------------------------------------------
Adaptive Security Consulting

Vulnerability Summary
-------------------------------------------------
The Hyland OnBase server is vulnerable to path traversal allowing attackers to read and write to arbitrary files on the
server.

Technical Details
-------------------------------------------------
The Hyland OnBase server fails to properly sanitize and escape user input allowing path traversal on the OnBase server.
Multiple methods were found that directly concatinate user input into local file system calls without validation. Two
separate types exist, read-only and write or append-only, allowing remote attackers who send SOAP calls directly to
vulnerable methods using vulnerable parameters (typically "FileName").

Seven read-only instances and twelve write or append-only instances were found allowing the attacker to read
configuration data and arbitrary files across the server and append, create, and write to arbitrary files on the
server, including uploading malicious DLLs and backdoors.

Solution
-------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, attempts to notify Hyland of the vulnerabilities have been rebuffed as not being something that they
have to fix since fixing vulnerabilities, according to the Director of Application Security, is "creating custom code"
and no known fix is in place. Run the Hyland OnBase server in a restricted environment under a service account that can
only access those files required to operate. Restrict the ability of the service account to write to files to the
greatest extent possible.

Timeline
-------------------------------------------------
07 May 2019 - Adaptive Security Consulting discovered a series of vulnerabilities in medical records management and
search applications being considered by our client
15 May 2019 - The client was provided with the results of the assessment, including POCs for a number of high and
critical vulnerabilities
12 July 2019 - Client asked for more information and demonstrations
01 October 2019 - Client asked to test latest version of Hyland software
15 October 2019 - Client was informed that EP1 contained many of the same vulnerabilities
March 2020 - Client contacted Hyland and spoke with the Director of Application Security who said that fixing
vulnerabilities was "writing custom code" and that Hyland "doesn't write custom code"
21 April 2020 - Adaptive Security Consulting attempted to contact Hyland's Application Security Team via email on
behalf of client, but attempts were ignored

# Re: Navy Federal Reflective Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

ASC, Thanks for the follow up.

For your reference (and anyone else out there), I have verified the
exploitability of multiple of your CVEs in later versions of onbase.
Specifically 18.0.0.37.

CVE-2020-25254 - SQL Injection - this appears to be limited to
read-only and often requires more than basic user privileges on
(workview configuration privilege) in addition to a basic user. In EP3
these appear to always require workview configuration privileges,
which I don't have on my configuration yet, so maybe it's patched in
EP3? Probably not, but it demonstrates activity in the right
direction.
CVE-2020-25248 - Path traversal for read access, definitely present.
In EP3 it looks like it requires additional workview configuration
privilege but I suspect it's still present.
CVE-2020-25247 - Path traversal for write access, it's there, but
requires privilege I don't have in my configuration yet. It should be
noted that this is limited to the current resourcePath & if that is on
a separate partition than the binaries location then this may be a
significant mitigating factor to exploit chaining with the proposed
DLL hijacking vulnerability.

The SQL injection has been the most valuable, I haven't been able to
write anything but I have confirmed the ability to dump data.
