Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it fails to properly sanitize user inputs, specifically when handling parameters passed as arrays. The application's input sanitization mechanisms do not account for parameters sent as arrays, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the application's failure to properly handle user-supplied inputs, particularly array parameters. The vulnerable code lies within `includes/authenticate.inc.php`.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application's core sanitization logic fails to handle array parameters, which allows attackers to bypass intended security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Database Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database due to the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to potentially obtain credentials such as keys which can then be used in the authentication process without knowing the username and password.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can lead to data modification, deletion, or other malicious activities on the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the application's login endpoint.
- **Malicious Array Parameter:** The exploit specifically targets the `username` parameter, sending it as an array (`username[]`) containing a malicious SQL payload.
- **Login Page:** The authentication process is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need prior authentication. The vulnerability can be exploited over a network by sending HTTP POST requests.
- **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** Attackers require the ability to send HTTP POST requests with a crafted payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) request demonstrating the exploit and a sample of a server response that shows the SQL error.
- The affected code is found in the file `includes/authenticate.inc.php`.
- The vulnerability was tested on both CE (Community Edition) and PRO (Paid) versions of the software, and both were vulnerable.
