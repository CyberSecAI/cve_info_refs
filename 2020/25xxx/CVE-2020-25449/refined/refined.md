The provided content describes a **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability in Cabot 0.11.12, but it **does not relate to CVE-2020-25449**, since the exploit report declares **CVE: N/A**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the "Address" column when creating a new instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent (Stored) XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the database and executed when the data is rendered in the browser.
*   Lack of input validation/sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that, when executed by an administrator, can steal their session cookies and potentially take over their account.
*   The XSS can be triggered from any account, including the Django administrator account.
*   The attacker can use stored XSS payloads for malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker creates a user account.
*   The attacker creates a new instance with the malicious XSS payload in the "Address" column.
*   The attacker creates a service, using the instance where the malicious payload was injected.
*   The attacker adds the administrator to the notification list.
*   When the admin runs a check on the service, the stored XSS is triggered in the background.
*   The attacker can then monitor the XSS execution details (e.g., screenshots, cookies) through an external service such as xsshunter.com.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account on the Cabot platform.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create new instances and services.
*   The attacker needs to be able to notify the target user (admin) of the service using a status check.
* The attacker can execute the exploit in background without any interaction of the target user.
