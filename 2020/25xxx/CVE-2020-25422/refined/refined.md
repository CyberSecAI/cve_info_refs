The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Edit Menu" feature of Mara 7.5. This is relevant to the CVE description which mentions an XSS vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing menu items. Specifically, it attempts to remove script tags but fails to prevent XSS by not encoding HTML entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate input sanitization: The application attempts to remove script tags but does not perform HTML entity encoding, which is a necessary countermeasure against XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to:
  - Account hijacking/session theft
  - Data theft/manipulation
  - Defacement
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload that contains JavaScript code, and inserts this payload into the "Edit Menu" feature, specifically in the menuedit.php page, as described in the steps to reproduce.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the "Edit Menu" feature, which is found at `/Mara/codebase/menuedit.php`.
