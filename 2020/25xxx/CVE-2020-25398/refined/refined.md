Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CSV injection flaw present in the InterMind iMind Server. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data when exporting to CSV files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or escape data before including it in a CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker can craft malicious data within the application that, when exported to a CSV file, will execute arbitrary commands when opened by a user. This is due to spreadsheet software interpreting certain characters (like `=`, `@`, `+`, or `-`) as the beginning of a formula rather than plain text.
- Data Exfiltration/Manipulation: By injecting malicious formulas, an attacker can manipulate data in the spreadsheet, potentially leading to data exfiltration or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Data Input: The attacker inputs malicious data through the applicationâ€™s interface or API.
- CSV Export Functionality: The application's CSV export feature is the attack vector, as it fails to properly sanitize the malicious data within the generated CSV file.
- User Interaction: The user must open the malicious CSV file in a spreadsheet application for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Application: The attacker needs to have access to the iMind Server to input malicious data.
- Knowledge of Exploitable Fields: The attacker needs to identify fields within the application that are included in CSV exports and are vulnerable to injection.
- Target User Interaction: The attacker relies on a target user to open the crafted CSV file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in InterMind iMind Server through version 3.13.65
- The exploit involves exporting data to a malicious CSV file that contains code execution payloads.
- The provided content includes screenshots demonstrating the exploitation.
