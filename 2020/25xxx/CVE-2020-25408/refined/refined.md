**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25408

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the "College Management System" application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, which allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify, delete, or create new entries for students, teachers, faculties, subjects, scores, locations, and article data within the application. This can lead to data manipulation, unauthorized access, and potential disruption of the system's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
