| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2020-10-23 14:42:25 UTC  ``` The search query is reflected back to the user, and injected in a form, so that the user can click on the "next page", etc. However, a specially crafted POST request can be used to reflect a DOM XSS, which can get automatically executed.   The XSS requires the victim to have installed their RHCS certificate in the web browser. If that certificate has sufficient permissions, the XSS can be used to execute arbitrary code, including sending and signing arbitrary certificates.  Vulnerable page : /ca/ee/ca/listCerts (there might be other pages vulnerable to a similar attack)  ``` document.write( "<button NAME=begin onClick='doNext(this)' VALUE='|<<' width='72'>|<<</button>\n"+ "<button "+disabledUp+" NAME=up onClick='doNext(this)' VALUE='<' width='72'><</button>\n"+ [...] "<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=skipNonValid VALUE='"+ (result.header.skipNonValid ? result.header.skipNonValid : "") + "'>\n"+ ```  Several POST parameters, including `skipNonValid`, are being reflected back to the browser without having been sanitized by the server. An attacker can use that to inject JavaScript in the DOM.  Attack scenario : A victim authenticated in RHCS web UI (the corresponding web browser has the required key/cert installed for client authentication), is tricked into clicking a button on an attacker-controlled website. The XSS can then be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of RHCS.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c7)  Eric Christensen    2021-02-11 18:30:25 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Because the cross-site scripting (XSS) attack requires the victim to have their RHCS certificate installed in their web browser to be successful, it is recommended that web browser not hold the keys and that the user use the command line interface (CLI) instead.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2021-03-02 15:27:57 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1934142](show_bug.cgi?id=1934142 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-25715 pki-core: XSS in the certificate search results [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c11)  Cedric Buissart    2021-03-03 20:44:42 UTC  ``` Upstream fix :  <https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/commit/13f4c7fe7d71d42b46b25f3e8472ef7f35da5dd6>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-15 13:26:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2021:0819 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0819](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0819)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1891016#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-15 17:25:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
