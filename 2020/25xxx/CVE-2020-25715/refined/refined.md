Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of sanitization of POST parameters, specifically including `skipNonValid`, when they are reflected back to the browser. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the DOM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, where the injected script is executed client-side within the user's browser rather than server-side.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application reflects POST parameters back to the user without proper sanitization, creating the opportunity for injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable web application.
- **Data Integrity Threat:** The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.  It can potentially lead to unauthorized actions like sending and signing arbitrary certificates, if the user has a certificate with sufficient permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **POST Request Injection:** Attackers craft a malicious POST request that includes the malicious JavaScript in a parameter like `skipNonValid`.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a victim into clicking a malicious link or button on an attacker-controlled website that submits the crafted POST request to the vulnerable application.
- **Requirement for victim certificate:** The XSS attack requires the victim to have their RHCS certificate installed in their web browser, this certificate would also need to have sufficient permissions to perform privileged actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Attacker:** The attacker can be external and does not require initial access to the target system.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to employ social engineering to get the victim to interact with the attacker's crafted link/request.
- **Victim Requirement**: The victim must have the RHCS certificate installed on their web browser and be authenticated to the web interface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the `/ca/ee/ca/listCerts` page, and potentially other similar pages.
- The fix involves sanitizing user-provided input before reflecting it back in the HTML.
- The vulnerability was fixed in pki-core version 10.9.0.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions prior to 8.3 are vulnerable.
- Mitigation involves not storing keys in the browser and using the CLI instead.
