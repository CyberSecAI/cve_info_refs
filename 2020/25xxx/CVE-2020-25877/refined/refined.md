Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-supplied data in the "Add Page" feature of the BlackCat CMS admin panel. Specifically, the application fails to perform HTML entity encoding on the page title, which allows for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious code injected into the page title is saved in the database and executed when that title is displayed on the page, affecting other users who view the page.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to prevent XSS by removing script tags, but this is insufficient. The use of `details` tag with `ontoggle` attribute bypasses the script tag filtering.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** JavaScript code can be used to steal cookies and hijack user sessions, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify page content, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could deface the website

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the BlackCat CMS application, specifically the admin panel where the "Add Page" functionality resides.
- **Malicious Input:** The attack is performed by inserting a crafted payload into the "Title" field when adding a new page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with permissions to access the BlackCat CMS admin panel.
- **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker requires access to the "Add Page" function of the admin interface.
