Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The "View Site" function in AntSword versions up to 2.1.8.1 improperly parses HTML tags when displaying cookies in the UI. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or escape the cookie values, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript/Node.js code to be embedded within the cookie and subsequently executed when displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the input when rendering the cookie values. This lack of sanitization allows a malicious user to insert HTML tags and JavaScript code into the cookie values.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The most direct vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the cookie, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, potentially accessing sensitive information or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Due to the nature of the environment, the injected JavaScript/Node.js code can be used to execute system commands, leading to remote code execution on the machine where the application is running.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the machine running the AntSword application by injecting malicious JavaScript into cookie values.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive data by injecting JavaScript that exfiltrates data from the application.
*   **System Compromise:** Through RCE, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Cookies:** The primary attack vector is the manipulation of cookies. An attacker who can control or influence the cookies sent to the application can inject malicious code. This could potentially occur via:
    *   Compromising a server where the target application is accessing the data.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities in the same system/environment which allows modification of cookies.
*   **View Site Function:** The application's "View Site" function is the vulnerable component. It parses and displays cookies received from the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Influence Cookies:** The attacker must be able to set or modify the cookie values that are sent to the AntSword application.
*   **Access to AntSword:** The attacker needs to have access to an AntSword instance to use the "View Site" functionality to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided issue report includes screenshots demonstrating how HTML tags and JavaScript code can be injected via cookies. The JavaScript payload provided in the report shows how to execute a reverse shell as a demonstration of RCE capabilities.
*   The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization of cookie data before rendering it in the user interface, which allows for arbitrary code execution.
