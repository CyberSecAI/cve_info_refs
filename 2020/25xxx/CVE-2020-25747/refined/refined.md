Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25747:

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect Access Control

**Root Cause:** The Telnet service of Rubetek cameras allows remote access to RTSP and ONVIF services without authentication.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication for accessing the RTSP and ONVIF services. This allows unauthorized users to connect to these services without providing any credentials.
*   **Telnet Service:** The Telnet service itself is insecure and should be avoided as it transmits data in plaintext. It is not explicitly stated that Telnet itself is the vulnerability, but it is a component of the root cause as it enables unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view live streams from the camera.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can restart the camera.
*   **Unauthorized Control:** Attackers can rotate the camera, change settings (brightness, clarity, time), and reset the camera to factory settings via the ONVIF service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** Anyone with network access to the vulnerable camera can connect to the ONVIF and RTSP services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the camera or have network access to it.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Rubetek RV-3406 cameras (firmware versions 339 and 342)
*   Rubetek RV-3409 cameras (firmware versions 339 and 342)
*   Rubetek RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions 339 and 342)

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor (Rubetek) was notified about the vulnerability.
*   There are no fixed firmware versions available at the time of the report.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sergey Zelensky of Jet Infosystems.
