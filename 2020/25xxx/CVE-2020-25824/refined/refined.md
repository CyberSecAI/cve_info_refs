Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-25824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an **incorrect access control** issue in Telegram Desktop versions 2.4.3 and earlier. Specifically, the application does not enforce passcode entry when the "Export" button is pressed within the "Export Telegram Data" wizard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authorization Check:** The application fails to verify if the user is authorized to perform the export operation despite a local passcode or auto-lock being enabled.
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** This allows an attacker to bypass the expected security controls (passcode/auto-lock) intended to protect the user's data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit leads to the attacker gaining access to all chat conversations and media files associated with the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring physical access to the victim's unlocked computer.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must have already started the "Export Telegram Data" wizard, but then left the computer unattended.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the victim's computer while the Telegram Desktop application is running and the export wizard is open.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to act while the user has left the computer unattended, but the export wizard is still active.

**Summary:**

In summary, CVE-2020-25824 is a vulnerability in Telegram Desktop that allows an attacker with local access to bypass the local passcode/auto-lock protection and export the user's chat data if the user has started the Export wizard and left the computer unattended.
