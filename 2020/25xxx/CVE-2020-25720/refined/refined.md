Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25720:

**Root Cause:**

-   A delegated administrator, granted the ability to create objects in Active Directory, gains ownership of the newly created object.
-   Due to the absence of an Access Control List (ACL) at the time of object creation, and the administrator being recognized as the 'creator owner', they can write to all object attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Lack of proper ACL enforcement:**  Insufficient ACL enforcement during object creation grants excessive permissions to the creator.
-   **Implicit "creator owner" rights:** The "creator owner" designation provides unintended write access to all attributes, including security-sensitive ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A delegated administrator can modify security-sensitive attributes of newly created objects, potentially leading to unintended privilege escalation.
-  **Security Risks**: The retained rights could lead to security risks due to the misinterpretation of the capabilities of the delegated administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   A delegated administrator with the ability to create objects in Active Directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker must have the delegated privilege to create objects within Active Directory.
-   The attacker needs to be aware of the implicit rights granted to object creators.

**Additional Details:**

-  The issue is specific to Samba Active Directory (AD) environments and not applicable to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) because Samba AD is not included in those products.
-  A protection mechanism exists (mentioned in CVE-2021-42291) which can remove the implicit rights of the object creator to write to all attributes.
-   This protection is off by default and needs to be enabled through configuration settings.

**Note:** The provided content indicates that while this vulnerability is related to CVE-2020-25720, it is not directly exploitable in the context of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Gluster Storage.
