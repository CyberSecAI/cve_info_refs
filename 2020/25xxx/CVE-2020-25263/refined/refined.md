{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that plugin deletion actions are performed via a GET request, rather than using POST requests with CSRF tokens.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into deleting arbitrary plugins by loading a malicious page, leading to a denial of service or potentially further compromise of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest that sends a GET request to the plugin deletion endpoint of the vulnerable application. The victim, being an authenticated administrator of the application, visits this malicious page, triggering the deletion of a plugin.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create and host the malicious HTML page. The attacker also needs to social engineer a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page. No direct access to the application is required."
