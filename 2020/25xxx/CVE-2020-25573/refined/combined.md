# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate called `mem::uninitialized()` to create a `NonNull<T>`,
which is undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of `mem::uninitialized()`.

```

| Any chance of a release with this fix? The crate is still fairly widely used, and with [rust-lang/rust#71274](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/71274) we are turning the UB here into a panic, which breaks the released version of this crate. |

| [@Gankra](https://github.com/Gankra) is there any plan on yanking the older (unsound) versions? This crate has many reverse dependencies yanking the older ones would ensure that they obtain a sound version of this crate instead of bumping the minimum dependency to 0.5.3 |

| [@Gankra](https://github.com/Gankra) a friendly reminder - it'd be great to yank the previous version as I've been bitten by this as well when using the toml\_edit crate and had to scan the backtrace and dig a bit to find that I should bump this transitive dependency to 0.5.3.  Pretty please 🙇 (if not that's fine too ofc, just let us know 🙂) |
