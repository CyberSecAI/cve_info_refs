```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of `mem::uninitialized()` to create a `NonNull<T>` pointer in the linked-hash-map crate, which results in an uninitialized pointer and is considered undefined behavior in Rust.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The creation of an uninitialized NonNull pointer violates a non-null constraint, leading to undefined behavior."
    ],
    "impact": "The undefined behavior can lead to crashes, data corruption, or other unpredictable issues, potentially causing a denial-of-service or other security impacts. Specifically, with `rust-lang/rust#71274` the undefined behavior can trigger a panic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by any usage of the vulnerable `linked-hash-map` crate in an application."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required. The vulnerability is present in the library itself and is triggered when the code is executed. Any application using a vulnerable version of the library would be affected."
