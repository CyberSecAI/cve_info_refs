Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-25644:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory leak occurs in WildFly OpenSSL due to `SSL_SESSION_free(session)` not being called by `remove_session_cb`.

- **Weakness/vulnerability present**: Memory leak.  The leak is exacerbated when client certificate authentication is used because the session then contains certificates, leading to a larger memory footprint per session.

- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to an out-of-memory (OOM) condition.

- **Affected Products**:
  - NetApp Service Level Manager
  - OnCommand Insight
  - OnCommand Workflow Automation
  - Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
  - Red Hat Single Sign-On

- **Non-Affected Products ( list is not exhaustive, see provided content for complete list)**:
  - 7-Mode Transition Tool
  - Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
  - Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
  - Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
  - OnCommand API Services
  - Clustered Data ONTAP

- **Remediation**:
  - Apply the patches provided by NetApp for the affected products (OnCommand Insight, OnCommand Workflow Automation).
  - Upgrade WildFly OpenSSL to version 1.1.3.Final or later.

- **Attack Vectors**:
  - The advisory mentions that public discussion exists regarding the vulnerability, implying it is remotely exploitable. The CVSS vector string confirms that the attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning that a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - No privileges are required (PR:N), and no user interaction is needed (UI:N).
