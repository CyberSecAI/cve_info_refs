The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `checkinstall` package.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `checkinstall` tool does not correctly preserve file permissions when handling symlinks within a package being created. Specifically, when creating a package from a tar archive, if the archive contains a symlink, the resulting file permissions on the target of the symlink within the created package are set to world-writable (777).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of file permissions when creating packages with symlinks.
- Creation of world-writable files which are supposed to have more restrictive permissions (755).

**Impact of exploitation:**
A local user can modify the contents of the world-writable file and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution as root if a root user executes the file. This leads to local privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Create a malicious tar archive containing a symlink pointing to a file.
- Use `checkinstall` to create a package from the malicious archive.
- Install the resulting package.
- Modify the world-writable target of the symlink.
- Wait for a root user to execute the target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a tar archive and execute `checkinstall`.
- Local user access on the target system.

The content also mentions a related bug where `checkinstall` fails if the symlink and target are in the opposite order in the archive. However, this is not directly related to the described vulnerability in the CVE description but rather a usability issue that is triggered by the way files are ordered within the package being constructed.
