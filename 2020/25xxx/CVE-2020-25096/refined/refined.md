The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in LogRhythm's SIEM solution, including CVE-2020-25096.

**CVE-2020-25096: Incorrect Access Control**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LogRhythm Web Console did not enforce access controls on WebSocket traffic. While HTTP traffic was authenticated with cookies, no equivalent token was present when the protocol switched to WebSockets.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of access control enforcement on WebSocket connections. The system relied on a 4-digit parameter to identify the target agent for commands.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could bypass access controls and execute commands on any connected system with an agent installed, regardless of the user’s intended access rights. A low-privileged user could execute arbitrary code with System privileges on all connected agent hosts.
*   **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the 4-digit agent identifier in the WebSocket request, an attacker could send commands to agents that the user should not have access to. An attacker could also brute-force the 4-digit parameter to gain access to all connected agents.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need a legitimate user account for the Web Console, but with any privilege level.

**Additional Context from the Article**

The article also details other related vulnerabilities:

*   **CVE-2020-25094: Command Injection**:  By manipulating the WebSocket traffic, an attacker could rewrite the PowerShell command sent to the back-end agent, allowing for arbitrary Remote Code Execution (RCE). This was possible because the commands were being forwarded by the Web Console as Windows PowerShell commands sent inside the WebSocket.
*   **(No CVE): The agent runs as WHAT?!?**: The LogRhythm Smart Response agent runs by default as the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" account, giving any commands executed through it the highest privileges on the system.
*   **CVE-2020-25095: Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH)**: The Web Console was vulnerable to CSWH due to not validating the "Origin" header in cross-domain WebSocket initiation requests and lacking CSRF protection. This would allow an attacker to make cross-domain requests and initiate a WebSocket connection, bypassing network segmentation.

The combination of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary remote code execution with the highest privileges on all systems with an agent installed, regardless of the victim user’s configured level of access or role. An attacker could leverage a user on a compromised computer behind a firewall to attack the LogRhythm Web Console.
