- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Several folders in the %PATH% are writeable by normal users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276). The vulnerability allows for a vertical privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can place malicious DLLs in writeable %PATH% folders. When the software searches for DLLs, it could load and execute the attacker's malicious code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable locally (AV:L) by an attacker with low privileges (PR:L). The attack doesn't require user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to write to folders in the %PATH%. They need low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
