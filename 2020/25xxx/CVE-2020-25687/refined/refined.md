{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to lack of length checks in `rfc1035.c:extract_name()`. This allows `memcpy()` in `sort_rrset()` to use a negative size, resulting in a large memory copy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
       "Missing length checks in the DNS name extraction function.",
      "Vulnerability occurs in the DNSSEC validation process before entries are validated."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service due to a crash in dnsmasq. Potential memory corruption and other unexpected behaviors on the target device.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker who can create valid DNS replies can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to control a DNS server used in the domain name resolution or inject packets into the network to trick dnsmasq.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to craft valid DNS responses and must have the ability to influence DNS resolution process or have network access to inject packets. DNSSEC must be enabled on the target dnsmasq instance."
