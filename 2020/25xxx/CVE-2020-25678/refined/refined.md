Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25678:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Ceph manager (mgr) modules' passwords, which are set via the command line interface (CLI), are written in clear text to the mgr logs. This happens because the commands are logged as strings, including the password values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Passwords used by mgr modules are stored in plaintext in log files. These log files are world-readable, meaning that anyone with access to the system can read the passwords.
- **Lack of proper sanitization:** The Ceph command logging mechanism does not sanitize or filter out sensitive information such as passwords before writing them to log files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:**  An attacker with access to the system can easily gain access to the cleartext passwords stored in the mgr logs. This could lead to unauthorized access to external systems or the Ceph cluster itself, depending on the module that was configured with the disclosed password.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, these passwords might belong to administrative users.
- **Compromise of external services:** If the disclosed passwords are used to authenticate to external services such as databases or other APIs, those could also be compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access to the system:** An attacker needs to have access to the system where the Ceph mgr is running and the ability to read the log files. The logs are typically located in `/var/log/ceph/ceph-mgr.$ID.log`.
- **Direct command execution:** The commands which are being logged, such as `ceph dashboard ac-user-create` or `deepsea config-set salt_api_password`, are executed on the system via the CLI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the Ceph mgr server with the ability to read the log files (e.g., via `sudo` or being the `ceph` user).
- No network access is required, therefore this is a local attack.
- No specific user account or privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects various mgr modules like deepsea, influx, diskprediction, dashboard, and restful.
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing a mechanism to filter out passwords from log messages, either by never logging them or replacing their values with asterisks.
- Some configurations that store values via "config set" are logged in the mon logs, but this is less of an issue when password values are hashed before being stored.
- The issue affects multiple versions of Fedora and Red Hat Ceph Storage.
- The fix involved sanitizing the command logs to prevent the disclosure of cleartext passwords, instead of trying to detect password params from the parameter name.
- This vulnerability also affects OpenStack Manila users, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- The issue was resolved in ceph version 15.2.9-1.fc33.
