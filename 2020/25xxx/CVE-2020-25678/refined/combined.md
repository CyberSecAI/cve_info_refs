**Description**

A number of mgr modules need passwords set for one reason or another, either to authenticate with external systems (deepsea, influx, diskprediction), or to define credentials for users of those modules (dashboard, restful).

In all cases, these passwords are set from the command line, either via module-specific commands (``ceph dashboard ac-user-create``, ``deepsea config-set salt_api_password``, etc.) or via ``ceph config set`` with some particular key (e.g.: mgr/influx/passsword)

All module-specific commands go through `DaemonServer::_handle_command()`, which then logs the command via `audit_clog->debug()` (or `audit_clog->info()` in case of access denied). This all ends up written to `/var/log/ceph/ceph-mgr.$ID.log`, which is world-readable, e.g.:

```

2018-12-03 10:45:28.864 7f67e7f8f700  0 log_channel(audit) log [DBG] : from='client.343880 172.16.1.254:39896/3560370796' entity='client.admin' cmd=[{"prefix": "deepsea config-set", "key": "salt_api_password", "value": "foo", "target": ["mgr", ""]}]: dispatch

```

Additionally, anything that results in a "config set" lands in the mon log, e.g.:

```

2018-12-03 10:45:28.881552 [INF]  from='mgr.295252 172.16.1.21:56636/175641' entity='mgr.data1' cmd='[{"prefix":"config set","who":"mgr","name":"mgr/deepsea/salt_api_password","value":"foo"}]': finished

```

This also appears in the Audit log in the Dashboard.

Some things that land in the mon log probably don't matter; for any module that hashes passwords before saving them, only the hashed password should land in the mon log. But there's still the problem of the CLI commands in the mgr log, and in any case, modules that need to authenticate with external services will need to store plaintext passwords.

ISTM we need to either never log these things, or somehow keep the command logging, but filter the passwords out, so it renders the value as "\*\*\*\*\*" instead of the actual password.

I'm not sure how best to approach this, given the way command logging is structured. At the point commands are logged, the commands themselves are just strings. Admittedly, they're strings of JSON, but they're effectively opaque at that point - we'd have to parse the JSON, then look for things that might be passwords, blank them out, and turn the whole lot back into a string. Yuck.

I would expect the `diskprediction\_cloud` module to also be affected by this. See <http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/mgr/diskprediction/#connection-settings>

I think that is going to be very hard to detect when a command parameter should be hidden or not. Because trying to deduce this point using only the name of the parameter probably will drive us to wrong decisions.

In my view, we have two options:
1. To have a predefined list of parameters names whose value must be hidden always in the logs.
2. To add a new optional parameter for all the Ceph manager commands ( --nolog for example ) to avoid to log the command (or just log the command without parameters)

For the current log trace:

```
cmd=[{"prefix": "dashboard ac-user-create", "force_password": true, "username": "admin", "password": "admin", "rolename": "administrator", "target": ["mon-mgr", ""]}]

```
I see some ways of dealing with it:

* **Forcing sensitive information not to be passed by command line** (e.g.: read from file): as commands are kept in shell history and procfs also keeps cmdline in memory.

* **Per-command**: Adding a new MonCommand FLAG (`src/mon/MonCommand.h`), like `FLAG_SANITIZE_CMDARGS`. It'd print the command trace but with everything except the `prefix` redacted out:
  ```
  cmd=[{"prefix": "dashboard ac-user-create", "force_password": SANITIZED, "username": SANITIZED, "password": SANITIZED, "rolename": SANITIZED, "target": ["mon-mgr", ""]}]

  ```

* **Per-argument 1 (new flag)** (as we may still want to log some command args): Adding a new command option to cmddesc, like `name=password,type=CephString,sanitized=true`
  ```
  cmd=[{"prefix": "dashboard ac-user-create", "force_password": true, "username": "admin", "password": SANITIZED, "rolename": "administrator", "target": ["mon-mgr", ""]}]

  ```

* **Per-argument 2 (new Ceph Type)**: Adding a new CephType, like `name=password,type=CephSecret`
  ```
  cmd=[{"prefix": "dashboard ac-user-create", "force_password": true, "username": "admin", "password": SANITIZED, "rolename": "administrator", "target": ["mon-mgr", ""]}]

  ```

* **New Ceph Option Flag**: Adding a new flag for Ceph Options (like `FLAG_DO_NOT_LOG`):
  ```
  cmd=[{"prefix": "dashboard ac-user-create", "force_password": true, "username": "admin", "password": SANITIZED, "rolename": "administrator", "target": ["mon-mgr", ""]}]

  ```

This would be required both for ceph-mgr commands and also for ceph-mon config/config-key commands, as these Mgr commands end up stored in the Mon KV store.

Rook really would benefit from at least a simple solution that sanitizes the log for setting the dashboard password. Rook doesn't need to worry about shell history either.

What's the simplest solution to avoid logging the dashboard username/password? Couldn't the log at least be sanitized if the prefix matches certain commands like "dashboard set-login-credentials"? Let's at least get something simple for the commands that currently exist instead of waiting for the perfect solution.

Debian Bug     : 1053690

Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in Ceph, a massively scalable,
open-source, distributed storage system that runs on commodity hardware
and delivers object, block and file system storage.

CVE-2019-10222

    A Denial of service was fixed: An unauthenticated attacker could crash
    the Ceph RGW server by sending valid HTTP headers and terminating the
    connection, resulting in a remote denial of service for Ceph RGW clients.

CVE-2020-1700

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW
    Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker
    can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a
    permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to
    a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually
    leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate
    users from connecting to the system.

CVE-2020-1760

    A XSS attack was fixed: A flaw was found in the Ceph Object Gateway,
    where it supports request sent by an anonymous user in Amazon S3.
    This flaw could lead to potential XSS attacks due to the lack
    of proper neutralization of untrusted input.

CVE-2020-10753

    A Header Injection attack was fixed: It was possible to
    inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag in an Amazon S3 bucket. The
    newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file
    generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is
    made.

CVE-2020-12059

    A Denial of Service was fixed: A POST request with an invalid tagging
    XML could crash the RGW process by triggering a NULL pointer exception.

CVE-2020-25678

    An Information Disclosure was fixed: ceph stores mgr module passwords
    in clear text. This can be found by searching the mgr logs for grafana and
    dashboard, with passwords visible.

CVE-2020-27781

    A Privilege Escalation was fixed: User credentials could be manipulated
    and stolen by Native CephFS consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in
    potential privilege escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request
    access to a share to an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users.
    The access key is retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of
    the requesting OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the
    attacker to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be
    done to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator.

CVE-2021-3524

    Similar to CVE-2020-10753, a Header Injection attack was fixed:
    It was possible to inject HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader
    tag in an Amazon S3 bucket

CVE-2021-3531

    A Denial of Service was fixed: When processing a GET Request in Ceph
    Storage RGW for a swift URL that ends with two slashes it could cause the
    rgw to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3979

    A Loss of Confidentiality was fixed: A key length flaw was found in
    Ceph Storage. An attacker could exploit the fact that the key length is
    incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key,
    which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and
    integrity on encrypted disks.

CVE-2021-20288

    A Potential Privilege Escalation was fixed: When handling
    CEPHX_GET_PRINCIPAL_SESSION_KEY requests, ignore CEPH_ENTITY_TYPE_AUTH in
    CephXServiceTicketRequest::keys.

CVE-2023-43040

    A flaw was found in Ceph RGW. An unprivileged
    user can write to any bucket(s) accessible by a given key
    if a POST's form-data contains a key called 'bucket'
    with a value matching the name of the bucket used to sign
    the request. The result of this is that a user could actually
    upload to any bucket accessible by the specified access key
    as long as the bucket in the POST policy matches the bucket
    in said POST form part.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
12.2.11+dfsg1-2.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ceph packages.
