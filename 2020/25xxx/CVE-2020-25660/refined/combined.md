| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1890354#c0)  Sage McTaggart    2020-10-22 00:34:53 UTC  ``` Ceph octopus lost CEPHX_V2 replay attack, and this was backported to nautilus in v14.2.5.This is very similar to a prior CVE, but we are requesting a new CVE because it only affects nautilus and later.  This flaw is very similar to CVE-2018-1128: It was found that cephx authentication protocol did not verify ceph clients correctly and was vulnerable to replay attack. Any attacker having access to ceph cluster network who is able to sniff packets on network can use this vulnerability to authenticate with ceph service and perform actions allowed by ceph service.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1890354#c5)  Sage McTaggart    2020-10-29 18:09:35 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/30524> <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/30523>  These are the commits where the flaw was introduced.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1890354#c8)  Sage McTaggart    2020-10-29 19:04:16 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Ilya Dryomov (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1890354#c18)  Sage McTaggart    2020-11-16 22:00:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 has already had a fix shipped for this particular flaw.
