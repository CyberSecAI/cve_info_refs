The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25605.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Agora Video SDK transmitted sensitive information required to join a video call (App ID, Channel Name, and Token) in plaintext over the network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive data.
- Lack of encryption for initial call setup information.
- Developers were not enabling encryption because of the lack of a secure method to generate or communicate the pre-shared key needed for the call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could eavesdrop on ongoing private audio and video calls without the knowledge of the participants.
- An attacker could join a call without the user’s knowledge.
- Attackers could use the App ID to host their own calls at the cost of the app developer.
- Potential for blackmail, harassment, or exposure of sensitive information (e.g. medical).

**Attack vectors:**
- Network traffic sniffing: An attacker intercepts the plaintext traffic containing the necessary parameters to join an ongoing video call.
- Replaying the captured information in a custom application or through the Agora SDK.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to capture network traffic, for example by being on the same network as the victim or through a man-in-the-middle attack.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how to interpret the captured packets and then re-use the captured credentials to join the video call.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected multiple popular mobile applications, including social apps like eHarmony, Plenty of Fish, MeetMe, and Skout, as well as healthcare apps such as Talkspace, Practo, and Dr. First’s Backline.
- Agora released a new SDK (version 3.2.1) to mitigate the vulnerability by providing an option to encrypt the initial call setup information.
- Even with the use of tokens and call encryption settings, the sensitive parameters were still transmitted in plaintext over the network.
