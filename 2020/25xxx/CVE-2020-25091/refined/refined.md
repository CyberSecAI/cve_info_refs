The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25091.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before displaying it in the web pages. Specifically, the code uses `$_POST` and `$_GET` variables directly in HTML output without encoding them, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities exist because user-provided data from `$_POST` and `$_GET` is directly outputted into HTML code without using `htmlspecialchars()` for encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web pages by manipulating the `$_POST` and `$_GET` parameters. When a user visits the page, the injected script will execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacement of web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the HTTP GET and POST parameters that are used to display data on the page. By manipulating parameters such as `username`, `email`, `notify`, `editLang`, `image`, `code`, `amount`, `valid_from_date`, `valid_to_date`, `folder`, `quantity`, `position`, and `virtual_products` an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or POST requests that include malicious JavaScript within the vulnerable parameters. The attacker does not require any specific position relative to the target and can initiate an attack by simply sending the malicious URL to the victim.
