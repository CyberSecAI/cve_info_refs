  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2020-25581",
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate FreeBSD. All supported versions of FreeBSD are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "A race condition in the jail_remove(2) implementation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A process running inside a jail can avoid being killed during jail termination. If a jail is subsequently started with the same root path, a lingering jailed process may be able to exploit the window during which a devfs filesystem is mounted but the jail's devfs ruleset has not been applied, to access device nodes which are ordinarily inaccessible. If the process is privileged, it may be able to escape the jail and gain full access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A process running inside a jail that is not properly terminated during jail removal may exploit a race condition during subsequent startup of a jail with the same root path."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a privileged process running inside of a jail.",
     "affected_products": "All supported versions of FreeBSD are susceptible to this vulnerability. However, no NetApp products are listed as being affected."
