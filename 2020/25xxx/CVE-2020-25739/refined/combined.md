## Package

bundler

gon
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 6.4.0

## Patched versions

6.4.0

## Description

An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson does not honor the escape\_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS protection mechanism. To mitigate, json\_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
