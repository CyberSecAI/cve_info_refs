# Crash in URL parsing

High

Sep 29, 2020

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

envoyproxy/envoy master between 2d69e30 and 3b5acb2

## Patched versions

master that includes 3b5acb2

## Description

## Brief description

Envoy master between [2d69e30](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/2d69e30c51f2418faf267aaa6c1126fce9948c62) and [3b5acb2](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/3b5acb2f43548862dadb243de7cf3994986a8e04) may fail to parse request URL that requires host canonicalization.

## CVSS

[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) (7.5, High)

## Affected version(s)

Envoy master between [2d69e30](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/2d69e30c51f2418faf267aaa6c1126fce9948c62) and [3b5acb2](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/3b5acb2f43548862dadb243de7cf3994986a8e04)

## Affected component(s)

URL parser

## Attack vector(s)

Use of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), that requires canonicalization (Punycode encoding: to convert Unicode characters to ASCII), as the host component in the request URL.

## Details

Envoy master between [2d69e30](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/2d69e30c51f2418faf267aaa6c1126fce9948c62) and [3b5acb2](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/3b5acb2f43548862dadb243de7cf3994986a8e04) may fail to parse request URL that requires host canonicalization. The use of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) as the host component in a request URL triggers the URL parser library used by Envoy to do Punycode encoding (to convert Unicode characters to ASCII). Since the conversion data is not available, it fails the conversion, which could result in executing code in faulting address (segmentation fault).

## Detection

Abnormal termination of the Envoy proxy process with the `url::IDNToASCII()` function at the top of the stack trace.
