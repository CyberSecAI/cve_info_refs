Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding the vulnerabilities fixed in Tiny Tiny RSS:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary focus of the fixes revolves around vulnerabilities in the `af_proxy_http` plugin and other related areas. The discussion highlights issues with URL handling, specifically related to:
*   Relative URLs in feeds
*   Incorrect construction of URLs when `SELF_URL_PATH` is misconfigured
*   Issues with CSRF-related changes, particularly impacting popup dialogs.
*   The bookmarklet for subscribing to a feed not working correctly

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper URL Handling:** The system was vulnerable to issues arising from misconfigured `SELF_URL_PATH` settings, potentially leading to broken links and unexpected behavior when constructing URLs. Specifically, the usage of '.' for `SELF_URL_PATH` is problematic.
*   **Relative URL Processing:**  The `rewrite_relative_url()` function had flaws that broke URLs with absolute paths due to a regression in a specific commit.
*   **CSRF Vulnerabilities:** Changes related to CSRF protection introduced issues in popup dialogs and possibly other areas of the application.
*   **Bookmarklet Issue**: The bookmarklet for subscribing to a feed was broken, requiring users to manually enter the feed URL, instead of automatically populating it based on the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Broken Links:** Users could encounter broken links or be redirected to blank pages.
*  **Insecure Connections**: Misconfiguration could cause the application to load content via insecure HTTP, even when accessed via HTTPS.
*   **Loss of Functionality**: Features like the bookmarklet feed subscription and popup dialogs could be rendered unusable.
*  **Potential for further exploitation**: although not explicitly stated, improperly handled URLs and CSRF vulnerabilities could potentially be leveraged for more malicious attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious RSS Feeds:** Attackers could potentially craft malicious RSS feeds with carefully constructed relative URLs to cause unexpected behavior within the application.
*   **Misconfigured Server:** Attackers might exploit misconfigurations of the `SELF_URL_PATH` to cause issues with the application when processing URLs.
*  **CSRF**: Attackers could potentially exploit CSRF vulnerabilities, although the exact impact is not detailed, the content does mention that some popup dialogs were broken.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would likely need to have knowledge of Tiny Tiny RSS's configuration and how the application handles URLs and CSRF protection.
*   An attacker could potentially exploit the system by injecting malicious content via RSS feed.

**Additional Notes**

*   The discussion implies that the vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed by Daniel Neagaru and other employees of DigeeX.
*   The fixes aim to address issues arising from both vulnerabilities and regressions in the code.
*   The developers are actively responding to user reports and continuing to fix issues arising from the changes.
*   The content suggests that the primary focus is on the `af_proxy_http` plugin and related url handling functionality.
*   The `_SKIP_SELF_URL_PATH_CHECKS` option is either deprecated or not being tested against.
*   The use of a relative path for the `SELF_URL_PATH` variable is not supported and will cause issues.
