  "response": {
    "root_cause": "CentralAuth was using the metawiki's actor ID when inserting a local ipblocks entry to suppress an account globally. This resulted in the creation of a block entry in the database with an `ipb_by_actor` that doesn't exist on the local wiki database, but only in the metawiki's database. The `User::getActorId()` method would return the actor ID from the local wiki instead of the correct foreign one.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect actor ID used for local IP blocks by CentralAuth.",
       "User::getActorId() not being wiki-aware.",
      "ActorMigration service not initially loading actor IDs from the correct database."
    ],
    "impact": "The local block would not be displayed in the blocking interface (Special:Block) due to the incorrect actor ID and it would not be possible to change/alter/remove the block. The block would also not take effect. This could lead to a situation where a user is thought to be blocked but is not actually being blocked on the local wiki.",
    "attack_vectors": "CentralAuth's local suppression feature when a user is globally suppressed.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to trigger a global suppression of a user via CentralAuth."
