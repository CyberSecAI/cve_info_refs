Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `HTTP_REFERER` header value before it is printed on the webpage. Specifically, the `info.php` script uses the `HTTP_REFERER` value without escaping it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied data (the `HTTP_REFERER` header) is directly included in the server's response without proper encoding or escaping.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web application fails to sanitize or validate the `HTTP_REFERER` header before using it in the web page content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `HTTP_REFERER` header, and this code will be executed by the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the webpage or redirect the user to other malicious sites.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to create fake login forms or other phishing scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP `Referer` Header Manipulation:** An attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable page (`/info.php`) with a malicious payload embedded within the `Referer` header.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the crafted link to trigger the XSS vulnerability. The attacker would need to trick the user into visiting a malicious URL that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP headers, specifically the `Referer` header, to inject their malicious code.
- **Ability to entice users to visit the crafted URL:** The attacker must lure or trick victims into visiting the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is located in the `webinc/js/info.php` file.
- The following code demonstrates how the vulnerable `HTTP_REFERER` value is used:

```php
$referer = $_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"];
if($referer == "")
    $referer = "./index.php";

if($_GET["REASON"]=="ERR_REQ_TOO_LONG")
{
    $message = "'".i18n("The action requested failed because the file uploaded too large.")."', ".
                "'<a href=\"".$referer."\">".i18n("Click here to return to the previous page.")."</a>'";
}

echo "\t\tvar msgArray = [".$message."];\n";
echo "\t\tBODY.ShowMessage(\"".$title."\", msgArray);\n";
```
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows that by sending a `GET` request to `/info.php` with `REASON=ERR_REQ_TOO_LONG` and a malicious value within the `Referer` header, an XSS attack can be performed:

```
GET /info.php?REASON=ERR_REQ_TOO_LONG&RESULT=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: uid=94UDHPkJzD
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Referer: "><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>
```
- This will result in the JavaScript `alert(document.cookie)` being executed when the page is loaded by the victim's browser.

**Affected Models:**

- The following models are reported to be affected by the XSS vulnerability:
  - DIR-803 (Hardware Revision Ax, Firmware 1.04.B02)
  - DIR-816L (Hardware Revision B1, Firmware 2.06 & 2.06.B09_BETA)
  - Other models are potentially vulnerable, including: DIR-645, DIR-815, DIR-860L, DIR-865L.

**Additional Information:**

- The D-Link announcement states that these devices are End of Support and are no longer receiving security updates. It recommends that users discontinue the use of these devices.
- The reported vulnerability was discovered by sek1th on 08/30/2020.
