DIR-803, DIR-815, DIR-816L, DIR-860L, DIR-645, DIR-865L :: End of Support Devices : Recent Security Vulnerability Report

**Overview**

The DIR-803, DIR-815, DIR-816L, DIR-860L, DIR-645, DIR-865L all hardware revisions, have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL") of there Lifecycles.

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for the products ceases. Products  purchased in the US that have reached EOS/EOL are moved to our Legacy Products site ([legacy.us.dlink.com](https://legacy.us.dlink.com)) which is the final archive as of the EOS/EOL date. **Please read information and recommendations**below.

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it. Once a product reaches its EOL/EOS date, it is transferred to <https://legacy.us.dlink.com/> .

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware from <https://legacy.us.dlink.com/> installed, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.

# XSS discovered in the D-link Firmware DIR-816L&DIR-803

## Vulnerable Firmware Versions

**DIR-816L REVB1 2.06 & 2.06.B09\_BETA(Lastest)
DIR-803 REVA 1.04.B02 (Lastest)**

*DIR-815 REVB 2.07.B01 & DIR-860L REVA 1.10B04 & DIR-645 REVA 1.06B01 & DIR-865L REVA 1.08B01 may also be affected.*

## Vulnerability Details

A Reflected Cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in DIR-816L and DIR-803, due to an unescaped `HTTP_REFERER` value being printed on the webpage.

## SYNOPSIS

In file **webinc/js/info.php**,there exists no output filtration being applied to the `HTTP_REFERER` parameter, before it's printed on the webpage.

## Analysis

```
From info.php:

$referer = $_SERVER["HTTP_REFERER"];
		if($referer == "")
			$referer = "./index.php";

		if($_GET["REASON"]=="ERR_REQ_TOO_LONG")
		{

			$message = "'".i18n("The action requested failed because the file uploaded too large.")."', ".
						"'<a href=\"".$referer."\">".i18n("Click here to return to the previous page.")."</a>'";
		}

		echo "\t\tvar msgArray = [".$message."];\n";
		echo "\t\tBODY.ShowMessage(\"".$title."\", msgArray);\n";
?>  },

```

So

```
POC：
