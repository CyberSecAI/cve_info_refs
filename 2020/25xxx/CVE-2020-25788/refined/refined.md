Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-25788:

**Summary:**

The discussion thread revolves around several security-related fixes pushed to the Tiny Tiny RSS (tt-rss) trunk, primarily concerning the `af_proxy_http` plugin. While the specific CVE isn't mentioned, the context strongly suggests the fixes are related to the vulnerabilities reported in CVE-2020-25788. The fixes, discovered and responsibly disclosed by Daniel Neagaru and other employees of DigeeX, aimed at addressing various issues, some of which are discussed in the thread.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
While the specific root cause of CVE-2020-25788 is not explicitly detailed in this thread, the discussion points towards vulnerabilities within the `af_proxy_http` plugin and related URL handling. The vulnerabilities seem to stem from how tt-rss handles and rewrites URLs, especially relative URLs, and potentially involve insufficient validation of the `SELF_URL_PATH` configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **`af_proxy_http` vulnerabilities:** The primary focus of the fixes was on this plugin, suggesting that issues existed in how it handled HTTP requests or responses.
*   **URL Rewriting Issues:** The thread highlights problems with the `rewrite_relative_url()` function, which incorrectly handles absolute paths within relative URLs, leading to broken links. The vulnerability is related to how tt-rss processes URLs in feed content and rewrites them for display.
*   **Inadequate `SELF_URL_PATH` Validation:** The discussion indicates issues with how `SELF_URL_PATH` is used and validated. Specifically, setting it to "." or using an incorrect scheme (http vs https) can cause unexpected behavior and errors.
*   **Potential CSRF Issues:** There's a mention of potential CSRF-related issues with less-used popup dialogs. This suggests vulnerabilities related to cross-site request forgery protection.
*   **Feed Subscription:** The discussion highlights that the feed subscription bookmarklet broke and that URLs passed in the query string were not being correctly handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Broken links:** Incorrect URL rewriting could lead to broken links, making it difficult to navigate the content within tt-rss.
*   **Inability to subscribe to feeds:** Problems with the bookmarklet and query string parameters would prevent users from subscribing to feeds.
*   **CSRF attacks:** Vulnerabilities related to CSRF could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
*  **Potential information disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, improper handling of URLs could potentially expose sensitive information, though this is not confirmed within the provided text.
*   **Insecure Connection Warning:** The user receiving an insecure connection warning shows that the application was not correctly configured and was attempting to send the session over a plain http connection instead of the expected https connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RSS Feeds:** Attackers could potentially exploit the URL rewriting issues by injecting specially crafted relative URLs into RSS feeds, which could redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **CSRF attacks:** Attackers could trick users into performing actions on their tt-rss instance without their consent by exploiting the CSRF vulnerabilities present in the popup dialogs or other areas of the application.
*   **Misconfiguration:** Misconfiguring `SELF_URL_PATH` could lead to broken functionality, and possibly provide some attack opportunities, though not confirmed in the text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject malicious content into RSS feeds:** Attackers could craft malicious links that leverage the URL rewriting vulnerabilities.
*   **Ability to trick users:** For CSRF attacks, attackers would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or performing a malicious action.

**Additional Notes:**

* The discussion points out that the fixes might break some existing configurations, particularly those relying on non-standard `SELF_URL_PATH` settings or using relative URLs in feed content.
* The thread also shows the developer's approach to handling these issues, which includes a trade-off between strictness and compatibility.
*   The developer acknowledges the shortcomings of the current code and is working on simplifying it, indicating an ongoing effort to improve the security and reliability of tt-rss.
