{
  "CVE-2020-25645": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Traffic between two GENEVE endpoints may be unencrypted when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel. The tunneled data is not correctly routed over the encrypted link and is sent unencrypted.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unencrypted traffic between Geneve endpoints due to incorrect routing when combined with IPsec."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Loss of data confidentiality, as anyone between the two endpoints could read the traffic.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network traffic interception between two GENEVE endpoints.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be positioned on the network between the two GENEVE endpoints.",
	"Additional Information": "This vulnerability is a flaw in the Linux kernel that affects versions before 5.9-rc7. It can occur when IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel."
