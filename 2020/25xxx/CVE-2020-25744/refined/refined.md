{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The SaferVPN for Windows application spawns openvpn.exe, which runs with SYSTEM privileges. The openvpn.exe process creates log files in a user-controlled directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Overwrite",
       "Use of user-controlled directory for log files created by a privileged process",
      "Lack of proper permission controls on log directories"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service by overwriting a high-privilege file (e.g., C:\\Windows\\win.ini). Although the attacker cannot control the content being written, the overwrite causes a DOS.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access using symbolic links to redirect the log file creation to a high-privilege file.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access and the ability to create symbolic links. User must have full control over the log folder."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "fix_details": "The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.0.3.3. The log file and the entire log folder were moved to C:\\ProgramData\\Mudhook Marketing, Inc\\SaferVPN\\Diagnostics\\Service with proper permissions.",
