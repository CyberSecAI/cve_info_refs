Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25718:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) did not properly validate if a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) was authorized to issue Kerberos tickets for specific users. This lack of validation occurred when the Samba AD DC accepted a ticket from a Samba or Windows RODC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The Samba AD DC failed to check the `msDS-NeverRevealGroup` and `msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup` attributes to determine if the RODC had the necessary permissions to generate tickets for a given user. These groups are intended to control which RODCs can access specific user credentials.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The Samba AD DC was missing a check to ensure RODCs only print tickets for users they are authorized to print tickets for.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has compromised an RODC could exploit this vulnerability to print Kerberos tickets for any user, including administrative accounts.
*   **Domain Compromise:** By obtaining administrator tickets, an attacker could gain full control of the Active Directory domain.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising an RODC and then using it to request and obtain unauthorized Kerberos tickets.
*   **RODC Compromise:** This attack requires prior compromise of a RODC.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Compromised RODC:** The attacker needs to have already compromised a Read-Only Domain Controller within the affected Active Directory domain.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Samba AD DC.

**Summary of Details:**

The vulnerability exists because the Samba AD DC does not properly validate Kerberos ticket requests from RODCs. The fix is to implement the missing check on group membership of the RODC in the `msDS-NeverRevealGroup` and `msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup` before issuing the ticket. This check enforces proper RODC authorization for ticket generation.

The vulnerability is rated as high severity and remotely exploitable, with a CVSSv3 score of 7.5.
