## CVE-2020-25718.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Samba AD DC did not correctly sandbox
==              Kerberos tickets issued by an RODC.
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2020-25718
==
== Versions:    Samba 4.0.0 and later
==
== Summary:     The Samba AD DC, when joined by an RODC, did
==              not confirm if the RODC was allowed to print a
==              ticket for that user.
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is able to support an
RODC, which is meant to have minimal privileges in a domain.

However, in accepting a ticket from a Samba or Windows RODC, Samba
was not confirming that the RODC is authorized to print such a ticket,
via the msDS-NeverRevealGroup and msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup (typically
"Allowed RODC Replication Group" and "Denied RODC Replciation
Group").

This would allow an RODC to print administrator tickets.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba  4.15.2, 4.14.10 and 4.13.14 have been issued
as security releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2019726#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-11-03 09:00:10 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:   Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is able to support an RODC, which is meant to have minimal privileges in a domain.  However, in accepting a ticket from a Samba or Windows RODC, Samba was not confirming that the RODC is authorized to print such a ticket, via the msDS-NeverRevealGroup and msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup (typically "Allowed RODC Replication Group" and "Denied RODC Replciation Group").  This would allow an RODC to print administrator tickets.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2019726#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2021-11-10 02:54:09 UTC  ``` Created samba tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2021718](show_bug.cgi?id=2021718 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25718 samba: Samba AD DC did not correctly sandbox Kerberos tickets issues by an RODC [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2019726#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-11-10 03:21:12 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
