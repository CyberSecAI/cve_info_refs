  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-25023",
    "description": "The vulnerability is located in the AESGCMOnCtrCipherState.encryptWithAd() method where multiple boundary checks are performed to prevent invalid length or offsets from being specified for the encrypt or copy operation. However, some checks were found to be either incomplete or missing, which would likely lead to the following scenarios: Out-of-bounds read or write with huge plaintextOffset, negative cipertextOffset, or negative length (Depending on the underlying JVM's validation). Exception thrown by the JVM instead of Noise-Java throwing ShortBufferException.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient boundary checks in the `AESGCMOnCtrCipherState.encryptWithAd()` method.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read or write due to large plaintextOffset, negative ciphertextOffset, or negative length.",
      "Potential for JVM exceptions instead of the expected ShortBufferException from Noise-Java."
    ],
    "impact": "Out-of-bounds read/write could lead to memory/secrets disclosure, arbitrary code execution within the JVM, denial of service, or data loss. If the JVM handles it, an unhandled exception could crash the JVM process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Passing large `plaintextOffset` values.",
      "Passing negative `ciphertextOffset` values.",
      "Passing negative `length` values."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the input parameters of the `encryptWithAd` method, specifically `plaintextOffset`, `ciphertextOffset`, and `length`."
