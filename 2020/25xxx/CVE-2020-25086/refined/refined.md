The provided content is related to CVE-2020-25086.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit addresses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in the application. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it in HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the direct output of unsanitized user inputs within HTML attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web pages. This could lead to:
*   Stealing of user session cookies
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Defacement of the website
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code in user-controlled input fields within the administrative interface. The following input fields were vulnerable:
*   Username field when adding or editing an administrator
*   Email field when adding or editing an administrator
*   Notification field when adding or editing an administrator
*  Language edit field
*  Blog image field
*  Discount code and amount fields
*  Product image field
*  Product quantity field
*  Product position field
*  Virtual product field

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields in the admin panel. This could mean that the attacker would need to be a valid user with admin privileges, or potentially could exploit another vulnerability to gain the ability to input data into these fields.

**Mitigation:**
The commit mitigates these vulnerabilities by applying `htmlspecialchars()` to the vulnerable user-provided inputs before rendering them in the HTML, which prevents the browser from interpreting the user input as code.
