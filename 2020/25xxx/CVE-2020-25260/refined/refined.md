{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hyland OnBase relies heavily on client-side validation, leading to multiple server-side deserialization flaws.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure deserialization using ASP.NET's BinaryFormatter.Deserialize, allowing injection of bytecode into SOAP messages.",
    "Insecure XML deserialization using various XML deserialization libraries.",
    "Insecure JSON deserialization."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the OnBase server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Injection of malicious bytecode into SOAP messages.",
    "Exploitation of XML-based deserialization vulnerabilities.",
      "Exploitation of JSON-based deserialization vulnerabilities."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote network access to the OnBase server. No user authentication or privileges are required."
}
