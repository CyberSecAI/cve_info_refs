Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

The content describes several vulnerabilities in rConfig version 3.9.5, including:

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `configcompare.crud.php` script discloses the contents of a file specified by the `path_a` parameter if it's different from the file specified by `path_b`.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input validation/sanitization on the `path_a` parameter in `configcompare.crud.php`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files such as `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php` with attacker-controlled `path_a` and `path_b` parameters.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the rConfig application.

2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php` script allows deletion of files based on user-supplied `path` and `ext` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:**  Inadequate input validation/sanitization on the `path` and `ext` parameters in `ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to denial of service or data loss.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php` with attacker-controlled `path` and `ext` parameters.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the rConfig application.

3.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `ajaxDeviceStatus.php` script makes a connection to a server based on user-supplied `deviceIpAddr` and `connPort` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of validation on the `deviceIpAddr` parameter in `ajaxDeviceStatus.php`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can make internal connections from the server to internal resources or external servers.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeviceStatus.php` with attacker-controlled `deviceIpAddr` and `connPort` parameters.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the rConfig application.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Root Cause:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs in the "Model" field when adding devices, "Command" field when adding commands, and "Snippet" field when adding snippets.
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate input sanitization on the mentioned fields in `/devices.php`, `/commands.php`, and `/snippets.php`.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or other attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker inserts a payload such as `<svg onload=alert(1)>` into the vulnerable fields and saves the entry. The XSS is triggered when the page with the reflected injection is loaded.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and able to access and modify entries related to devices, commands, and snippets.

5. **Privilege Escalation**
    * **Root Cause:** The `sudo` tool is configured in a way that allows the exploitation of `zip` and `crontab` for privilege escalation.
    * **Weakness:**  Misconfiguration of the `sudo` tool and the ability to run `zip` and `crontab` as a privileged user.
    * **Impact:**  The attacker can escalate their privileges to root.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker executes `sudo zip` and `sudo crontab -e` to run commands as root.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have sudo permissions for `zip` and `crontab`.

6. **Arbitrary file read through tail:**
    * **Root Cause:** Usage of `tail` which can be leveraged to read files
    * **Weakness:**  Use of `tail` without proper sanitization
    * **Impact:**  The attacker can escalate their privileges to root.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker executes `tail` with arguments that allow to read files.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have permissions to execute `tail` on the server.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig. However, without the specific CVE description, it's impossible to directly correlate the described vulnerabilities to **CVE-2020-25352**. Therefore, I will respond with **NOINFO**, since the provided information is not sufficient to determine if this content relates to the specified CVE.
