Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-25170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, the B. Braun OnlineSuite software mishandles multiple input fields during an Excel export, leading to an Excel Macro Injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability is an "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File" (CWE-1236), which allows for Excel Macro Injection. This means that when data from the OnlineSuite is exported to a CSV file and opened in Excel, specially crafted input could be interpreted as a formula or macro.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the following impacts:
*   **Compromised Integrity:** Attackers can inject malicious formulas or macros into the exported CSV files.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** Sensitive information within the CSV file could be accessed or leaked.
*   **Compromised System:** If the injected macro is malicious, it can lead to further exploitation of the system where the CSV file is opened.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attack involves:
1.  Manipulating input fields within the OnlineSuite.
2.  Exporting data to a CSV file.
3.  The victim opening the maliciously crafted CSV file using Microsoft Excel, which then executes the injected formula or macro.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OnlineSuite application.
*   **High Privilege:** The attacker must have high privileges on the OnlineSuite application to manipulate input fields for export.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (i.e., the victim must open the specially crafted CSV file).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in B. Braun OnlineSuite versions AP 3.0 and earlier.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 6.9, with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Julian Suleder, Nils Emmerich, and Birk Kauer of ERNW Research GmbH; Dr. Oliver Matula of ERNW Enno Rey Netzwerke GmbH.
