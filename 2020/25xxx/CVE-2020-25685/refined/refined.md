{
  "CVE-2020-25685": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in dnsmasq's reply_query() function, where a loose check on the query name is performed when matching a reply to a forwarded query. Instead of strictly matching the query name as specified in RFC5452, dnsmasq uses a weak hash (CRC32 or SHA-1) of the query name. This allows an off-path attacker to find different domain names that result in the same hash, thus significantly reducing the number of attempts required to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the usage of a weak hash of the query name in `reply_query()`, rather than matching the full query name, as per RFC5452.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Weak hash function for query name comparison",
      "Insufficient validation of DNS query names in replies"
    ],
    "impact": "An off-path attacker can more easily forge DNS replies, leading to DNS cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Off-path network attack",
      "Forging DNS responses"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to inject forged DNS responses into the network. No prior access to the target system is required."
