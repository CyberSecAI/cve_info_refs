Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-25698:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on user enrollment capabilities during course restoration in Moodle. Specifically, when a user restores a course into an existing course, the system does not adequately verify if the user has the necessary permissions to unenroll other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization checks during the course restoration process. This allows users (specifically teachers in this case) to perform actions (unenrolling users) they should not be permitted to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized User Unenrollment:** A teacher could exploit this vulnerability to unenroll students from a course without having the appropriate permissions. This leads to disruption of learning, data loss and administrative overhead.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Course Restoration:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user restores a course backup into an existing course.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Teacher Role:** The attacker needs to have the role of a teacher or have the ability to restore courses within the Moodle environment.
- **Existing Course:** The attacker needs access to a course where they can perform the restore operation.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 3.5 to 3.5.14, 3.7 to 3.7.8, 3.8 to 3.8.5, 3.9 to 3.9.2 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.
-   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Moodle versions 3.10, 3.9.3, 3.8.6, 3.7.9 and 3.5.15.
