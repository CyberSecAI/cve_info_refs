1. [Fix a bug in xml stream parsing where a previously unmatched node cau…](/antchfx/xmlquery/commit/e26cec513303f0794d94c9b80cee131eb925908a)
    …

   ```
   …sing all subsequent valid matches fail.

   Recall that for streaming mode, we have two xpaths: one for matching the element, the other (optionally) for
   adding additional filtering. Imagine the following example, where the xml doc is:

   ```
   	<ROOT>
   		<AAA>
   			<CCC>c1</CCC>
   			<BBB>b1</BBB>
   			<DDD>d1</DDD>
   			<BBB>b2<ZZZ z="1">z1</ZZZ></BBB>
   			<BBB>b3</BBB>
   		</AAA>
   		<ZZZ>
   			<BBB>b4</BBB>
   			<BBB>b5</BBB>
   			<CCC>c3</CCC>
   		</ZZZ>
   	</ROOT>
   ```

   The stream parser is created as:

   ```
   	CreateStreamParser(strings.NewReader(s), "/ROOT/*/BBB", "/ROOT/*/BBB[. != 'b3']")
   ```

   Basically we want the stream parser to return all the `BBB` nodes whose text aren't `b3`. By looking at the sample
   XML, we know it should return: the `<BBB>` nodes whose texts are `b1`, `b2`, `b4`, and `b5`.

   However, the current code only returns `b1` and `b2`.

   The problem lies in the stream element matching inside `case xml.StartElement`.

   Currently the code does this:

   ```
   case xml.StartElement:
   	...
   	...
   	if p.streamElementXPath != nil {
   		if p.streamNode == nil {
   			if QuerySelector(p.doc, p.streamElementXPath) != nil {
   				// Now we assume this node is the stream node candidate.
   			}
   ```
   We originally under the assumption that if the `streamElementXPath` query returns anything, it must be this node itself;
   thus if it returns, this node is the stream node candidate.

   But it's clearly wrong in this `b3` example above. For the node `<BBB>b3</BBB>` it is first considered as the stream
   candidate, but later filtering (`[. != 'b3']`) removes its stream node status, and treats it just like any other non-stream
   nodes, and keeps it in the node tree. But the problem is, by keeping it in the tree, any future XML element start will
   **always** "matches" `streamElementXPath`. So in the example above, the node `<ZZZ>` is now erroneously considered stream
   node, and any child nodes are not even tested for streaming anymore.

   There are two fixes:

   1) In `xml.StartElement` stream match, instead of just doing `QuerySelector(...) != nil` check, we need to issue a
   `QuerySelectorAll(...)` call and examine all the returned nodes, if the current node is one of them, then this current node
   is considered stream candidate.

   2) Simpler: if a stream candidate is later filtered out inside `case xml.EndElement` handling, then simply remove
   it from the node tree, thus preventing future erroneous matches.

   1) seems an overkill: if a stream candidate gets filtered out, it's hard to imagine caller would like to interact with it
   in any capacity. Thus chose fix 2).
   ```

### Summary

The `LoadURL` function allows all response types/formats to be parsed *(other than XML)*, so that it can proceed to the next process (e.g. `xmlquery.(*Node).InnerText` from `xmlquery.FindOne`) without validation.

### Description

This security issue affects all `xmlquery` version.

### Steps to Reproduce

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/antchfx/xmlquery"
)

func main() {
	wadl, err := xmlquery.LoadURL("https://httpbin.org/get")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	attr := xmlquery.FindOne(wadl, "//application/@xmlns")
	fmt.Println(attr.InnerText())
}
```

The logs will look similar to the following:

```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x28 pc=0x6a179a]

goroutine 1 [running]:
github.com/antchfx/xmlquery.(*Node).InnerText.func1(0xc00032e2d0, 0x0)

github.com/antchfx/xmlquery.(*Node).InnerText(0x0, 0x746b67, 0x14)
        /home/dw1/.go/src/github.com/antchfx/xmlquery/node.go:67 +0x84
main.main()
        /tmp/xmlquery.go:15 +0xa0
exit status 2

```

### Recommended Mitigations

* Validates the response from URLs loaded in `LoadURL`, if not XML format; then returns an error.
* Using `xml.Unmarshal` *(only to check the validity of the XML content)*.
