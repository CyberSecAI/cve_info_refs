Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-25621:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The local Postgres database on the SolarWinds N-Central backend does not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication for the local Postgres database.
- Storage of sensitive data (private keys, MD5 password hashes, and plaintext passwords) in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Access to sensitive data including private keys, password hashes, and plaintext passwords, potentially leading to full compromise of the backend system and related systems.
- Ability to compromise N-Central backend by accessing the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The database is usually protected by a local firewall on the backend server.
- An attacker can bypass the firewall by exploiting other vulnerabilities, such as the SSH port forwarding vulnerability (CVE-2020-25619), to access internal services, including the unauthenticated database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to find a way to bypass the firewall.
- Access to an agent or N-Central user to leverage SSH port forwarding.
