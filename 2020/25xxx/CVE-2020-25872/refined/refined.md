Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the file manager plugin of FrogCMS v0.9.5. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when viewing uploaded files. Specifically, it doesn't adequately handle encoded directory traversal sequences like `.%2f%2f./` in the GET request parameter, leading to arbitrary file access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the ability to traverse directories using specially crafted file paths.
* **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization to prevent directory traversal sequences from being interpreted as such, allowing attackers to break out of the intended directory.
* **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability is present when logged in as an admin and view the uploaded files, meaning the admin user has enough access to trigger this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as:
   * Configuration files (e.g., `config.php`), which might contain database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
   * Source code files (e.g., `index.php`), allowing attackers to understand the application's logic and potentially identify further vulnerabilities.
* **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read system files or source code could lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request. The vulnerable parameter is used when viewing uploaded files.
* **URL Encoding:** Attackers use URL encoding (`%2f` for `/`) to bypass some basic input filters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authentication:** The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality of the file manager plugin.
* **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL encoding to craft the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided examples show how an attacker can read `config.php` and `index.php`. However, any file readable by the webserver's user is accessible.
* The use of `.%2f%2f./` indicates that the application might be attempting to normalize paths using a technique that is not sufficient to handle directory traversal.
* The provided images shows the code outputted by the server, which indicates no output sanitization is performed.
