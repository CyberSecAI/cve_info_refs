  "cve": "CVE-2020-25656",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free was found in the way the console subsystem was using ioctls KDGKBSENT and KDSKBSENT. A local user could use this flaw to get read memory access out of bounds.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Linux kernel",
        "StarWind HCA, SA, VTLA",
    "StarWind VSAN for vSphere builds 12533, 12658, 12859, 13170, 13586, 13861"
 ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Race condition in the virtual terminal (vt) driver within the KDGKBSENT (getter) and KDSKBSENT (setter) ioctl handlers, leading to a use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can achieve out-of-bounds read memory access, potentially leaking sensitive kernel data or causing a denial of service (crash).",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system is required. Specifically, the attacker needs access to a virtual terminal or the `CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG` capability.",
        "required_capabilities": "Local user with CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability or access to a virtual terminal, and ability to use ioctl calls on the virtual terminal device."
  },
    "additional_information": {
        "mitigation": "The issue has been fixed in kernel 5.10-rc2. For systems that cannot immediately update, it is possible to mitigate the issue by restricting access to the `/sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj` files.",
        "poc": "A Proof of Concept (PoC) was created utilizing `userfaultfd` to control the order of free and use operations, which is included in the provided content."
