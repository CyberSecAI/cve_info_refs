At least "CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG" needs to be enabled, but this is not the only precondition. As far as I know, there is no known way today for triggering this until CONFIG_KASAN enabled (that is parameter for runtime memory debugger and usually disabled for production systems). Means that if parameter CONFIG_KASAN not enabled for the kernel (for rhel* by default disabled), then the bug happens silently (without kernel crash) since read use-after-free usually not easily triggerable.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1888726#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-16 13:51:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2021:0856 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0856](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0856)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1888726#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-16 13:52:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2021:0857 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0857](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0857)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1888726#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-16 19:19:06 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Then it needs a buffer for a local copy of'kb_string'.KDSKBSENT (the setter) needs a copy up to the length of'user_kdgkb->kb_string'.That means, we obtain the index before the switch-case and use it inboth paths and:1) allocate full space in the getter case, and2) copy the string only in the setter case. We do it by strndup_user   helper now which was not available when this function was written.Given we copy the two members of 'struct kbsentry' separately, we nolonger need a local definition. Hence we need to change all the sizeofshere too.Signed-off-by: Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>--- drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c | 42 +++++++++++++++++++-------------------- 1 file changed, 20 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)diff --git a/drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c b/drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.cindex 55014f57a3de..81afe0438b34 100644--- a/drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c+++ b/drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c@@ -2021,7 +2021,7 @@ int vt_do_kdsk_ioctl(int cmd, struct kbentry __user *user_kbe, int perm, /* FIXME: This one needs untangling */ int vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl(int cmd, struct kbsentry __user *user_kdgkb, int perm) {-	struct kbsentry *kbs;+	char *kbs; 	u_char *q; 	int sz, fnw_sz; 	int delta;@@ -2034,39 +2034,37 @@ int vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl(int cmd, struct kbsentry __user *user_kdgkb, int perm) 	if (!capable(CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG)) 		perm = 0; -	kbs = kmalloc(sizeof(*kbs), GFP_KERNEL);-	if (!kbs) {-		ret = -ENOMEM;-		goto reterr;-	}+	if (get_user(kb_func, &user_kdgkb->kb_func))+		return -EFAULT; -	/* we mostly copy too much here (512bytes), but who cares ;) */-	if (copy_from_user(kbs, user_kdgkb, sizeof(struct kbsentry))) {-		ret = -EFAULT;-		goto reterr;-	}-	kbs->kb_string[sizeof(kbs->kb_string)-1] = '\0';-	kb_func = array_index_nospec(kbs->kb_func, MAX_NR_FUNC);+	kb_func = array_index_nospec(kb_func, MAX_NR_FUNC);  	switch (cmd) { 	case KDGKBSENT: { 		/* size should have been a struct member */ 		ssize_t len = sizeof(user_kdgkb->kb_string); +		kbs = kmalloc(len, GFP_KERNEL);+		if (!kbs)+			return -ENOMEM;+ 		spin_lock_irqsave(&func_buf_lock, flags);-		len = strlcpy(kbs->kb_string, func_table[kb_func] ? : "", len);+		len = strlcpy(kbs, func_table[kb_func] ? : "", len); 		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&func_buf_lock, flags); -		ret = copy_to_user(user_kdgkb->kb_string, kbs->kb_string,-				len + 1) ? -EFAULT : 0;+		ret = copy_to_user(user_kdgkb->kb_string, kbs, len + 1) ?+			-EFAULT : 0;  		goto reterr; 	} 	case KDSKBSENT:-		if (!perm) {-			ret = -EPERM;-			goto reterr;-		}+		if (!perm)+			return -EPERM;++		kbs = strndup_user(user_kdgkb->kb_string,+				sizeof(user_kdgkb->kb_string));+		if (IS_ERR(kbs))+			return PTR_ERR(kbs);  		fnw = NULL; 		fnw_sz = 0;@@ -2084,7 +2082,7 @@ int vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl(int cmd, struct kbsentry __user *user_kdgkb, int perm) 		else 			fj = first_free; 		/* buffer usage increase by new entry */-		delta = (q ? -strlen(q) : 1) + strlen(kbs->kb_string);+		delta = (q ? -strlen(q) : 1) + strlen(kbs);  		if (delta <= funcbufleft) { 	/* it fits in current buf */ 		    if (j < MAX_NR_FUNC) {@@ -2136,7 +2134,7 @@ int vt_do_kdgkb_ioctl(int cmd, struct kbsentry __user *user_kdgkb, int perm) 		    funcbufsize = sz; 		} 		/* finally insert item itself */-		strcpy(func_table[kb_func], kbs->kb_string);+		strcpy(func_table[kb_func], kbs); 		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&func_buf_lock, flags); 		break; 	}-- 2.29.1 ``` | \ |

Debian Bug     : 949863 968623 971058

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-19039

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    assertion failure (WARN).  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) if the panic_on_warn kernel parameter is set.

CVE-2019-19377

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19770

    The syzbot tool discovered a race condition in the block I/O
    tracer (blktrace) that could lead to a system crash.  Since
    blktrace can only be controlled by privileged users, the security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    out-of-bounds write.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0423

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could result in a use-after-free.  On systems using this driver, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28941

    Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Speakup screen
    reader subsystem.  Speakup assumed that it would only be bound to
    one terminal (tty) device at a time, but did not enforce this.  A
    local user could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.160-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2020-0427

    Elena Petrova reported a bug in the pinctrl subsystem that can
    lead to a use-after-free after a device is renamed.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25645

    A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE
    encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is
    configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the
    GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the
    encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive

    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that

[StarWind’s response to Apache Log4j2 vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 (Log4shell)](https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/apache_log4j/)

# Vulnerability Management Policy

StarWind follows a resilient and robust product security and vulnerability management policy.

StarWind puts a heavy emphasis on ensuring the security of our products and services since the release of our first product and throughout the entire company history. We always use extensive vulnerabilities testing programs, conduct periodical developer training, and implement secure design principles. As well, StarWind constantly works on improving extending its security development policies.

StarWind adheres to the following process to address vulnerabilities and inform our customers:

### **Constant** analysis

Our products and services are constantly and strictly analyzed for known vulnerabilities. This involves mandatory scans of all ready-to-release products and features inside the organization prior to the actual product release and delivery to the customers.

### Notification

StarWind makes sure to inform the customers in case the vulnerabilities are discovered. This is achieved by automatic notification of any vulnerability discovered to the customers who are subscribed for StarWind Security updates. This allows our customers to always stay informed and undertake the appropriate actions to ensure their business proper operation.

### Verification of the fixes

StarWind always first tests the fix to the identified vulnerability through a thorough QA cycle. Once the fix has been verified, we release a private security update and notify our customers about it as well as steps required to apply it. The StarWind security updates are delivered separately (for the subscribers or on-demand) and all of them are included as part of general StarWind build updates.

### Resolution

Once the resolution to the vulnerability is found, tested, and verified, we notify our customer about the resolution process and the steps required to resolve the vulnerability.

StarWind security and vulnerability information-delivery methods:

* Security Notice – informs customers about the security vulnerabilities that can affect StarWind products and require an upgrade or specific customer action to remediate.
* Security Bug Report – informs customers about low-level security vulnerabilities and can be resolved by a standard build upgrade procedure.

### **Security** updates **delivery**

StarWind as a company issues private security updates. Once notification about the potential vulnerability fix is received, a customer who is subscribed to the StarWind Security updates, receives notice on the remediation process steps. To receive a private security update, subscribe to StarWind Security updates or submit a request via StarWind support form – <https://www.starwindsoftware.com/support-form> with the description the vulnerability that is under the consideration.
