{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Hyland OnBase relies on client-side validation and contains direct string concatenations to form SQL queries on the server side, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection",
     "Connection String injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote users can execute arbitrary SQL queries as the database administrator. Attackers can modify, delete, insert, or read arbitrary data inside the database, probe backend services, connect OnBase to a malicious SQL server, and execute arbitrary commands as the database administrator. Connection String injection allows unauthenticated users to connect OnBase to arbitrary SQL servers and execute arbitrary commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a SOAP request to the OnBase server querying the vulnerable service method and using the injection point.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the OnBase server. Some vulnerabilities are accessible to unauthenticated users, many to any authenticated user, and a few require special (but not administrative) permissions."
