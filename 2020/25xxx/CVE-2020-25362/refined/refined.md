Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is the lack of input validation in the `details.php` script when handling the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically an error-based blind SQL injection. This vulnerability exists because the `id` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, product information, and potentially other sensitive data. The exploit-db entry specifically mentions the ability to "retrieve all databases".
*   **Authentication Bypass:** One comment on the sourcecodester page mentions using the payload `' or 1=1 --` to bypass authentication, although the exploit-db entry describes SQL injection in a different script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `details.php` script with a manipulated `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL (`/alphaware/details.php?id=...`) is the direct attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web application to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQLi:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques, specifically error-based blind SQL injection, to craft the exploit. Tools like sqlmap can automate this process.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a proof-of-concept (POC) using `sqlmap` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as "Online Shopping Alphaware 1.0".
*   The software was tested on Windows 10 Pro 1909 (x64_86) with XAMPP 3.2.4
*   The vulnerable path is `/alphaware/details.php?id=431860`

This information clearly relates to a SQL injection vulnerability, and it provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including the vulnerable parameter, the attack vector, and a PoC.
