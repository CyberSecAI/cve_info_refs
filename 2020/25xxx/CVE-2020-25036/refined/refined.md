Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25036:

**CVE-2020-25036:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `showDhcpLeases` command, which allows piping the output to `less`. This implementation of `less` does not disable command execution using the `!` (bang) command, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, which results in escaping the restricted CLI environment.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Unrestricted command execution within `less`.
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization when piping output to `less`.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can escape the restricted CLI environment and gain access to a restricted `rbash` shell, which can then be escalated to a `sh` shell, allowing further system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must be logged into the CLI as an authenticated user, which due to default credentials, is equivalent to unauthenticated access.
    *   The attacker uses the `showDhcpLeases less` command to enter the `less` interface.
    *   The attacker uses the `!` command within `less` to execute arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires network access to the Ucopia appliance and default admin credentials to access the CLI interface.
