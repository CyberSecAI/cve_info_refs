- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software insecurely loads libraries, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking due to uncontrolled search path element. Specifically, the software loads libraries in an insecure manner.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation by a local attacker could lead to a takeover of the system where the software is installed. This indicates full compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable software will load it from.
