WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• If possible do not execute the LOGO! Soft Comfort software with administrative privileges
• Restrict access to project files on the engineering station to trusted users
• Import only project files from trusted sources

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

LOGO! Soft Comfort is an engineering software to configure and program LOGO! BM (Base Module)
devices.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25243

A zip slip vulnerability could be triggered while importing a compromised project file to the affected
software. Chained with other vulnerabilities this vulnerability could ultimately lead to a system takeover
by an attacker.

CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
(’Path Traversal’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25244

The software insecurely loads libraries which makes it vulnerable to DLL hijacking. Successful
exploitation by a local attacker could lead to a takeover of the system where the software is installed.
