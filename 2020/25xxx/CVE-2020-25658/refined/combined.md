## Description

![@tomato42](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618246?v=4&size=48)[tomato42](https://github.com/tomato42)opened [on Oct 26, 2020](https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/issues/165#issue-729797804)

Current PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption code:

|  | blocksize = common.byte\_size(priv\_key.n) |
| --- | --- |
|  | encrypted = transform.bytes2int(crypto) |
|  | decrypted = priv\_key.blinded\_decrypt(encrypted) |
|  | cleartext = transform.int2bytes(decrypted, blocksize) |
|  |  |
|  | # Detect leading zeroes in the crypto. These are not reflected in the |
|  | # encrypted value (as leading zeroes do not influence the value of an |
|  | # integer). This fixes CVE-2020-13757. |
|  | if len(crypto) > blocksize: |
|  | raise DecryptionError('Decryption failed') |
|  |  |
|  | # If we can't find the cleartext marker, decryption failed. |
|  | if cleartext[0:2] != b'\x00\x02': |
|  | raise DecryptionError('Decryption failed') |
|  |  |
|  | # Find the 00 separator between the padding and the message |
|  | try: |
|  | sep\_idx = cleartext.index(b'\x00', 2) |
|  | except ValueError: |
|  | raise DecryptionError('Decryption failed') |
|  |  |
|  | return cleartext[sep\_idx + 1:] |

performs the checks on the decrypted value in turn, aborting as soon as first error is found, it also raises an exception in case of errors. This likely provides enough of a timing side channel to mount a Bleichenbacher style attack.

While it's unlikely that a completely side-channel free implementation is possible (see <https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2018/08/03/constant-time-compare-in-python/> ), it should be possible to minimise the side-channel by making at least the execution path the same irrespective of previous checks and by providing an API that returns a randomly generated secret in case of error (instead of leaking the timing side-channel by rising an exception) for uses that decrypted value directly as an input to a hash or use it as a symmetric key.

I haven't looked at the old code, but I don't expect any old versions to be secure, the issue at least partially stems from the fact that the API raises an exception in case of malformed plaintext, so all versions that can raise an exception in decryption API are vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1889972#c10)  Alicja Kario    2020-11-10 11:23:17 UTC  ``` It looks like all versions since 2.1 (inclusive) are vulnerable, versions before 2.1 don't provide RSA decryption API: <https://github.com/sybrenstuvel/python-rsa/commit/714324a9a34f0958704e5064251a1f00ed37a372>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1889972#c13)  Jason Shepherd    2020-11-18 01:21:55 UTC  ``` .   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1889972#c18)  Summer Long    2020-12-10 02:29:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-rsa package.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1889972#c19)  Huzaifa S.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.
