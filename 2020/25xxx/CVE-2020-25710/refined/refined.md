  "CVE-2020-25710": {
    "Description": "Two vulnerabilities in the certificate list syntax verification and in the handling of CSN normalization were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash) via specially crafted packets.",
    "Root cause": "An assertion failure in the csnNormalize23 function due to invalid input during CSN normalization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of invalid input during CSN normalization.",
      "Lack of proper input validation leading to an assertion failure."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to slapd daemon crash.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted packets sent to the OpenLDAP server.",
      "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send these packets."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send network packets to the OpenLDAP server." ,
      "No authentication is needed."
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
       "The vulnerability is triggered in the `csnNormalize23` function within `servers/slapd/schema_init.c`",
       "Patches were provided in OpenLDAP commit `bdb0d459187522a6063df13871b82ba8dcc6efe2` and `ab3915154e69920d480205b4bf5ccb2b391a0a1f`",
       "Fixed in OpenLDAP version 2.4.56.",
       "NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of OpenLDAP are affected."
