Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `sized-chunks` crate has multiple soundness issues stemming from incorrect size handling and lack of panic safety in `Chunk` and `InlineArray` types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Chunk Size Checks:**
    *   When `Chunk` is constructed with `unit()` and `pair()`, the array size is not checked leading to potential overflow and out-of-bounds access.
    *   When `Chunk` is constructed from an `InlineArray`, the size is also not checked, leading to potential out-of-bounds access.
*   **Panic Safety:**
    *   The `Clone` and `insert_from` methods of `Chunk` are not panic-safe. If a panicking iterator is used during cloning or insertion, it can lead to memory safety issues like double-frees or use-after-free.
*   **Unaligned References:**
    *   `InlineArray` can generate unaligned references when used with types that have large alignment requirements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory corruption:** Due to unchecked array sizes and lack of panic safety, memory corruption is possible which can lead to crashes, denial of service or even arbitrary code execution.
*   **Undefined Behavior**: Generating unaligned references leads to undefined behavior.
*   **Denial of Service:** The application using the crate might panic due to the issues and can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious input**: By providing inputs that trigger the vulnerable code paths
*   **Panicking Iterators**: By providing iterators that panic during `clone` or `insert_from` methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the inputs to the `sized-chunks` library. This could be through data provided to an application using the library or through manipulating program flow.
*   No special privileges are required and the attack is network exploitable according to the CVSS score.

**Additional Details (from the Github issue):**

*   The issue was found during a security scan on crates.io.
*   Demonstration code is provided to show each of the vulnerabilities. The code includes examples of how to trigger each issue.
*   The issue also mentions that `insert_from` relies on the correctness of `ExactSizeIterator`, which is not a safe assumption.
*   The advisory also notes a minor issue: using `debug_assert!` where `assert!` should be used.

This information provides significantly more detail than a simple CVE description would provide.
