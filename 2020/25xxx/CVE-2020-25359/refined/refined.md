Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in rConfig version 3.9.5:

**Vulnerabilities identified:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root cause:** The `/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php` script discloses the content of a file specified via the `path_a` parameter when comparing it to another file via the `path_b` parameter, if they are completely different.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization or validation on file paths.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted request to `/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php` with manipulated `path_a` and `path_b` parameters.
    *   **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php` script deletes files based on the `path` and `ext` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation or sanitization of the file paths provided by the user.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can delete any file on the server with a specified extension.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php` with manipulated `path` and `ext` parameters.
    *   **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    *  **Root cause:** The `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeviceStatus.php` script opens a connection to a host specified by the `deviceIpAddr` parameter and port specified by the `connPort` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation or sanitization of the hostname/IP and port provided by the user
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can use the server to make connections to internal resources or external servers.
    *   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeviceStatus.php` with manipulated `deviceIpAddr` and `connPort` parameters.
    *    **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root cause:** Multiple instances of stored XSS vulnerabilities are present in the application.
        *   `/devices.php` (Add device form) via the `Model` field.
        *   `/commands.php` (Add command form) via the `Command` field.
        *   `/snippets.php` (Add snippet form) via the `Snippet` field.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization on user-supplied data before storing it in the database.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will be executed when other users view the affected pages.
    *   **Attack vector:** Injecting a malicious payload (e.g., `<svg onload=alert(1)>`) into the vulnerable fields and then accessing the pages which render the user supplied data.
    *   **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to be able to access the forms and submit the malicious payloads.

*   **Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Root cause:** The blog post lists two ways to achieve privilege escalation by exploiting the sudo permissions:
         *  Using `sudo zip`: allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
         *  Using `sudo crontab -e` then executing a shell.
    *   **Weakness:** Misconfigured sudo permissions that allow a non-privileged user to run commands as root.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain root access on the server.
    *   **Attack vector:** By using the exposed sudo commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
    *   **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to have a shell on the system and sudo privileges for one of the listed commands.

*   **Arbitrary File Read via Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Root cause:** Exploiting the privilege escalation methods and using `tail` to read arbitrary files.
    *   **Weakness:** Combination of the privilege escalation vulnerabilities and a known method to read files using tail.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read any privileged file on the system.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploiting the sudo privilege escalation to read arbitrary files using tail.
    *   **Attacker capability:** An attacker needs to have a shell on the system with sudo access and then use tail to read files.

**Summary:**

The blog post details multiple vulnerabilities within rConfig 3.9.5, including LFI, arbitrary file deletion, SSRF, and multiple XSS vulnerabilities. It also describes two ways to achieve privilege escalation, leading to arbitrary file reads as root. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, delete important data, make connections to internal servers, inject malicious scripts and gain complete control of the server.
