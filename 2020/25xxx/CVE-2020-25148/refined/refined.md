Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `iftype` component of the Observium application. Specifically, the `type` parameter in the URL is not sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. It allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `type` parameter of the URL, which is then reflected in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions:
   - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
   - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive data from the victim's browser.
   - **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content.
   - **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - **Defacement:** Modifying content displayed on the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `type` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to trick a user into clicking the malicious link to trigger the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the `type` parameter in the `iftype` component is vulnerable.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that contains a working XSS payload.
- **Ability to deliver the URL:** The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to click the malicious URL (e.g., through a link in an email or message).

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `iftype.inc.php` file, specifically in the lines where the `type` parameter is extracted from the URL and used to construct the HTML title of the page.
- The provided example shows how the payload `<svg onload=alert(1)>` injected into the `type` parameter is rendered in the HTML and executes the JavaScript.

```php
29 for ($i = 0; $i < count($vars['type']);$i++) { $vars['type'][$i] = nicecase($vars['type'][$i]); }
30 $types = implode(' + ', $vars['type']);
31
32 register_html_title("$types Ports");
33
34 echo generate_box_open(array('title' => 'Total Graph for ports of type : '.$types));
35
```

The vulnerable code is located in the line 34, where the unsanitized $types variable is used.
