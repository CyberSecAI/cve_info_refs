Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Consul KV API's lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when the `raw` parameter is used. Specifically, when the KV API is called with the `raw` parameter, the stored value is served without JSON wrapping, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where a specially crafted key-value entry can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser when viewed in the Consul KV API's raw mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of successful exploitation can vary widely and could lead to targeting a Consul service, the environment where it is situated, or users interacting with the service. XSS vulnerabilities can potentially be used for:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacement of the Consul UI
    - Further exploitation of the environment

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Consul KV API, by storing a specially crafted payload as a key-value entry. 
- The payload is then triggered when a user accesses the API endpoint with the `raw` parameter set.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to write data to the Consul KV store.
- They also need knowledge of the API and the ability to craft malicious payloads, specifically ones that will be executed as JavaScript within the browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all Consul versions up to 1.9.4.
- It is fixed in versions 1.9.5, 1.8.10, and 1.7.14.
- The vulnerability is present only when the raw parameter is used with the Consul KV API.

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, which would likely only indicate the presence of an XSS vulnerability in the KV API.
