The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Booking Core 1.7, including CVE-2020-25445.

**CVE-2020-25445**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input when generating CSV files, allowing for CSV formula injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** CSV Formula Injection. Specifically, the "Subscribe" feature's first name and last name fields are vulnerable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** When an admin downloads and opens the exported CSV file, the malicious formulas embedded in the cells will be executed. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the admin's system, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can inject malicious Excel formulas into the "first\_name" and "last\_name" fields when using the subscribe feature.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "Subscribe" feature. The vulnerability is triggered when an admin downloads and opens the exported CSV file. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
