Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25132:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of input parameters. Specifically, the application fails to handle array-type parameters correctly, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database queries via crafted array-type input parameters.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application's input sanitization mechanisms are inadequate and fail to properly handle array parameters, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full Authentication Bypass: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, attackers can bypass the application's authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
- Potential Data Breach: Successful SQL injection could allow attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malformed HTTP Request: The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing a cookie with an array-type parameter (`ckey[]`) that includes malicious SQL code.
- Specifically, the `ckey[]` parameter is designed to bypass input validation by being an array type instead of a string/integer the application expects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: Attackers need network access to the application.
- Understanding of Application's Parameter Handling: Attackers need to understand how the application handles parameters to craft the SQL injection payload.
- No prior authentication: Attackers do not need to authenticate with the application, the vulnerability bypasses authorization checks.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Code Location: The vulnerability exists in the `/var/opt/observium/html/includes/authenticate.inc.php` file, specifically line 188-189:
   ```php
    $ckey = dbFetchRow("SELECT * FROM `users_ckeys` WHERE `user_uniq` = ? AND `user_ckey` = ? LIMIT 1",
    array($user_unique_id, $_COOKIE['ckey']));
   ```
- The vulnerability is triggered by the  `$_COOKIE['ckey']` not being properly sanitized, and allowing array types to reach the database query.
- Example exploit request:
    ```
   GET /?debug=0 HTTP/1.1
   Host: localhost
   User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_3) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.1.1 Safari/605.1.15
   Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
   Accept-Language: pl,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
   Connection: close
   Cookie: ckey[]=1 or expire>1597307817; dkey=1
    ```
- The injected SQL statement is: `1 or expire>1597307817`

**Affected Software:**
- Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community version 20.8.10631

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both the Community Edition (CE) and the paid Professional Edition (PRO) of Observium.
- The provided proof of concept works without the `debug` parameter; `debug` was used to track the injection point.
