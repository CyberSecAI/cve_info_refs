Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)** vulnerability. Specifically, the application does not properly restrict the use of XML external entities when processing parameter entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The vulnerability lies in the software's failure to sanitize or restrict XML external entities when processing project files. This lack of proper handling allows for the potential injection of malicious XML code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive files on the local system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted project file. This implies that the attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the targeted system.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to open the malicious file within the vulnerable application (LeviStudioU).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the local system to deliver the malicious project file.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory states the vulnerability is of a low skill level to exploit, indicating that it does not require deep technical knowledge to execute.
*   **User Action:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted project file in the vulnerable LeviStudioU application.

**Additional Information**
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely
*   CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated. CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
