- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of an outdated cipher mode on port 10005/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially extract the encryption key from a captured communication with the device, which could then be used for further attacks, potentially compromising confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, targeting port 10005/tcp of the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the affected device and the ability to capture communication to exploit the vulnerability.
