Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25635:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `aws_ssm` connection plugin in Ansible uses an S3 bucket to transfer files to instances. However, it fails to remove these files from the S3 bucket after the file transfer is complete.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of Garbage Collection:** The plugin does not implement a mechanism to clean up files in the S3 bucket after they are no longer needed. This leads to the files persisting indefinitely.
- **Data Exposure:**  The files remain in the S3 bucket after the play has completed, which exposes the data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality. Sensitive data transferred via the plugin remains accessible in the S3 bucket to anyone with access to the bucket.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the S3 bucket used by the `aws_ssm` connection plugin could gain unauthorized access to transferred files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the S3 bucket used by the vulnerable `aws_ssm` connection plugin to read the files.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects Ansible collection `aws_ssm` connection community plugin versions 1.0.0 to 1.2.1
- An upstream fix is available and was addressed in pull request #237
- The fix was included in the aws_ssm version 1.3.0
