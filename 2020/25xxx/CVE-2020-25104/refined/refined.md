Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- It arises from the lack of sanitization of user-uploaded file attachments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Persistent XSS:** The application allows users to upload files containing malicious scripts. These scripts are then executed when other users (or the same user) access or view the uploaded file.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the content of uploaded files, allowing malicious code to be embedded and later executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- This could lead to various attacks, including:
  - Account hijacking (session stealing)
  - Data theft or manipulation
  - Defacement of the application
  - Redirection of users to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker with a valid account on the Eramba platform uploads a file with malicious javascript (e.g., a specially crafted image file).
- When another user (or the attacker) views or interacts with the uploaded file, the embedded JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a valid user account in Eramba, meaning they must have already been authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to upload attachments.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor's response indicates that the vulnerability is not considered severe because the attacker needs an existing account, which implies a degree of trust.
- The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the output of attachments.
- The provided writeup provides more detailed information on the vulnerability than the official CVE description.
