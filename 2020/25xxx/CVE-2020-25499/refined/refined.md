Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication or authorization checks when handling POST requests to the `/boafrm/formSysCmd` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands through the `sysCmd` parameter. The vulnerability is exposed through the "Run Command" functionality of the router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The web interface does not require a valid authentication token or cookie to execute the system command.
*   **Insecure System Command Handling:** The system's "Run Command" functionality does not properly sanitize input or restrict the commands that can be executed.
*   **Publicly Accessible Interface:** The vulnerability is more dangerous when the router's management interface is accessible through the public IP address on the WAN port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control of the router, with root privileges, by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker could access or manipulate sensitive data stored on the router.
*   **Network Disruption:** The attacker can disrupt network services by causing denial-of-service, network reconfiguration or malicious traffic redirection.
*   **Botnet Enlistment:** The compromised device can become part of botnets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/boafrm/formSysCmd` with the desired command within the `sysCmd` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without a valid authentication token if an administrator session is active.
*   **Remote Exploitability:** The router can be exploited remotely if the administration interface is accessible via the WAN port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's management interface (either LAN or WAN if remote management is enabled).
*   **Knowledge of the Target Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the `/boafrm/formSysCmd` endpoint and the `sysCmd` parameter.
*   **HTTP Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **Admin Session Timing:** The attacker needs to send the crafted request while an administrator session is active or if authentication is not enforced.

**Additional Information:**

*   The router uses BusyBox, which allows the attacker to execute commands like `telnetd` to gain a shell with root privileges.
*   The vendor (Totolink) has released a firmware update to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 9.09.2020, as mentioned in the content.
