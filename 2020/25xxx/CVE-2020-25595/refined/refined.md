  "CVE-2020-25595": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Code paths in Xen's MSI handling act on unsanitized values read back from device hardware registers. Devices with out-of-spec \"backdoor\" operations can affect the result of these reads.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper use of register data, acting on unsanitized values read from hardware registers.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A guest that is not fully trusted may be able to crash Xen, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded.",
    "Attack vectors": "Guests with passed-through PCI devices exploiting out-of-spec functionality of hardware registers.",
