Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25876:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Pages" feature of Codoforum. Specifically, the application fails to properly HTML entity encode the 'Page Title' when it's reflected back in the web page.
*   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application allows the injection of malicious scripts due to inadequate output encoding of user-provided data.
*   **Impact:** A successful XSS attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a malicious payload into the "Page Title" field through the admin panel, then the page is viewed by a user, which executes the malicious javascript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have an account with administrator privileges to access the admin panel and create pages.
    *   The attacker must be able to add and save a new page with a malicious payload in the "Page Title" field.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious page is viewed by another user.

**Technical Details**
*   The specific payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability was `'><details/open/ontoggle=confirm(document.domain)>`. This payload leverages the `details` HTML tag along with the `ontoggle` event handler to execute JavaScript code upon the tag's opening.
* The provided information indicates that merely removing script tags is insufficient to prevent the XSS, because it does not stop the usage of other vectors of attack such as event handlers in HTML tags.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is found in Codoforum V.5.0.2.
*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability, which means the malicious payload is stored on the server and executed each time the page is visited.
*   The provided information goes into greater detail than the summary CVE, as it provides the specific vulnerable location and proof of concept attack.
