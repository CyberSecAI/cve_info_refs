# Cross Site Script Vulnerability on "Pages" in Codoforum feature V.5.0.2 #3

## Description

![@r0ck3t1973](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62001260?v=4&size=48)[r0ck3t1973](https://github.com/r0ck3t1973)opened [on Sep 15, 2020](https://github.com/r0ck3t1973/xss_payload/issues/3#issue-701570289)

**Describe the bug**

An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a Stored XSS vulnerability in the "Pages" feature.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Login into the Admin panel
2. Go to 'codoforum/admin/index.php?page=pages/pages'
3. Click Add Page
4. Insert Payload in 'Page Title':

   '><details/open/ontoggle=confirm(document.domain)>
5. Click Save
6. Go to Page 'codoforum/admin/index.php?page=pages/pages'
7. XSS Alert Message

**Expected behavior**

The removal of script tags is not sufficient to prevent an XSS attack. You must HTML Entity encode any output that is reflected back to the page

**Screenshots**

1. Add Pages

[Download v.5.2.1](buy)

 [Community](http://codologic.com/forum)

## Released on Sept 4th 2022

## Beautifully Designed

![](img/codoforum-forum-software-screenshot.png)

Say good bye to the old, cluttered and cumbersome
forum interfaces. Our Forum software has a fresh UI which is
simple, clean and impressive with a fast and secure engine
underneath.

---

## Mobile Ready

No more separate apps or websites for mobile
devices. Codoforum provides a free layout structure that is fully
responsive, which can not only spread throughout large screens but
also squeeze into tiny devices.

[![php forum responsive](img/forum-software-phone.png)](http://bradfrostweb.com/demo/ish/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcodologic.com%2Fforum%2Findex.php%3Fu%3D%2Fforum%2Ftopics%2Fgeneral-discussion#disco)

---

## Rich Content

Our WYSIWYG shows live preview as you type. It
recognizes Markdown as well as BBCode if you are coming from another
forum script. Images and other rich content can be easily embedded,
files can be attached and code blocks are prettified.

![php forum markdown bbcode](img/wysiwyg.gif)

---

## SSO & Integration

Our discussion software integrates with your existing website's
login system and it provides name and avatar synchronization too.
Now you don't need a separate login for your website and your forum
software.
It also supports the most popular social logins,
reducing the time-to-post and increasing the likelihood of engaging
a visitor.

![php forum SSO social login](img/social_login.png)

---

## Mentions

User can mention each other in posts by typing an
"@" before the username. Mentioned users are instantly notified by
desktop notifications or by e-mail if they are offline. This way
they can quickly jump into the discussion.

![forum software notifications](img/mentions.gif)

---

## Tagging

Do you feel forum categories are too restrictive?

![forum software tags](img/forum-software-tags.gif)

---

## Daily & Weekly Digest

Your visitors don't visit the forum often? but you
still want to send them a gist of the interesting things that
happened in the forum ? It is now possible with the daily and
weekly digest which sends your visitor a beautifully formated mail
that contains all the interesting events that happened in their
absence and make them come back for more.

![forum digest](img/forum-email-digest.png)

![unread notification](img/forum-notifications.gif)

## Notifications

The notification system provides you live updates as and when new
replies are posted or your name is mentioned.

 Not on
the same tab or window? No problem, with desktop notifications,
we will send you notifications no matter which window you are on.

![unread notification](img/notification-subscriptions.gif)

## Subscriptions

Tired of those confusing subscription systems?
 With
Codoforum, you can set your subscriptions and notification level
by simply moving the slider.

 Can't remember which
topics you have subscribed to? No problem, Codoforum will list
all your subscriptions with their respective notification
levels for you.

---

## Built for developers

The code is clean, well documented and extensible. Codoforum is
built with PHP using the latest coding patterns and is fully
compliant with the new PSR standards.

The installation is
easier than Wordpress!
