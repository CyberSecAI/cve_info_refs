  "CVE-2020-25600": {
    "description": "The so called 2-level event channel model imposes different limits on the number of usable event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels, due to limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information structure, whereas all other domains can use up to 4095 in this model. The recording of the respective limit during domain initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit didn't get updated accordingly.\n\nDue to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail. Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared info structure.",
    "root_cause": "The recording of the event channel limit for 32-bit x86 domains occurred too early in the domain initialization process, before the domain was recognized as 32-bit, resulting in an incorrect, higher limit being applied.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect limit setting during domain initialization.",
      "Failure to update event channel limit when domain type is recognized as 32-bit x86.",
       "Potential for out of bounds write to shared info structure."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, to misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest can exploit this by allocating more event channels than permitted for 32-bit x86 domains.",
      "Subsequent use of the out-of-bounds event channels can corrupt the shared info structure, potentially leading to system instability and DoS."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged guest is required to allocate the excess event channels. The guest must be 32-bit x86."
