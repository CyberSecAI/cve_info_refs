{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the way the `snoopy.class.inc` library handles external web feeds. Specifically, it uses the `exec` function to call `curl` with user-provided URIs without proper sanitization of the URI or additional command line parameters, allowing an attacker to inject `curl` specific parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to insecure use of `exec` and `curl`",
    "Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided URI and command line parameters used by the curl command.",
    "Use of an ancient library with known vulnerabilities."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server by injecting `curl` command line parameters that allows downloading a malicious php shell on the web server, provided write permissions are available on the webserver.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'Add New Webfeed' functionality in ILIAS, where the application calls `curl` on the provided external web feed URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges to access the 'Add New Webfeed' functionality. They also need to have the ability to host a malicious file (e.g. a php shell) on a remote server accessible to the vulnerable ILIAS server."
