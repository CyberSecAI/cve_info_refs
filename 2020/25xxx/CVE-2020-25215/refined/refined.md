Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-25215

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The yEd Graph Editor application has XML External Entities (XXE) enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application parses XML files (specifically GraphML documents) without properly disabling or sanitizing external entity references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially exfiltrate files from the victim's workstation by crafting a malicious XML file that includes references to local files. The attacker can then cause the application to parse this file, which results in the local file's content being included in the XML parsing output, which is then accessible to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML File:** The attack is carried out by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted XML file (GraphML document) with the yEd Graph Editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft a malicious XML file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a GraphML file that contains the malicious XML payload.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable yEd Graph Editor application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable version is 3.20, and the fixed version is 3.20.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Czarnecki.
- The CVSS score is 2.9 (Low).
- The attack requires user interaction and has a low impact on confidentiality with no impact on integrity or availability, according to the provided CVSS score.
