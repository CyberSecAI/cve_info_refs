SSA-139628: Vulnerabilities in Web Server for Scalance X Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2021-01-12
2021-09-14
V1.2

SUMMARY

Several SCALANCE X switches contain vulnerabilities in the web server of the affected devices.

An unauthenticated attacker could reboot, cause denial-of-service conditions and potentially impact the
system by other means through heap and buffer overﬂow vulnerabilities.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Limit network trafﬁc of web servers of Scalance X switches to trusted connections by ﬁrewall rules

(port 443/tcp).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15799

The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to reboot the device over the network by
using special urls from integrated web server of the affected products.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Vulnerability CVE-2020-15800

The webserver of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a heap overﬂow
condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending specially crafted
requests. This could stop the webserver temporarily.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25226

The web server of the affected devices contains a vulnerability that may lead to a buffer overﬂow
condition. An attacker could cause this condition on the webserver by sending a specially crafted
request. The webserver could stop and not recover anymore.
