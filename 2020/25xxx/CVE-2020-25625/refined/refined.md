{
  "CVE-2020-25625": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An infinite loop issue was found in the USB OHCI controller emulator of QEMU while servicing OHCI isochronous transfer descriptors (TD). It occurs when a TD is retired after passing its time frame, without checking if it was already processed and holds an error code. This can happen if the TD list has a loop.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Infinite loop vulnerability in the USB OHCI controller emulator."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume CPU cycles on the host, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious guest user or process can craft a looped TD list to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to control the guest operating system and the ability to manipulate the OHCI transfer descriptors."
  }
