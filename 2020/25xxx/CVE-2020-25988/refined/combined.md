[00:03] welcome again
[00:05] hope y'all had coffee and cake and are
[00:07] happy now
[00:08] um i'm going to talk on topic of upnp
[00:12] universal pwn and play as we call it
[00:15] if you're an attacker it's the most
[00:16] amazing protocol you ever found on the
[00:18] network your defender
[00:20] i'm sorry
[00:24] you'll see why
[00:26] um agenda first of all bit of an
[00:28] overview what is upnp
[00:30] then we're going to attack uh sorry
[00:32] cover bit like how it works and attacks
[00:34] and
[00:35] a bit of defense also of course and
[00:38] maybe a demo at the end
[00:40] we'll see about that actually
[00:42] we had a bit of technical problems also
[00:45] upnp what is it how does it work um
[00:49] it's universal plug and play and
[00:51] if you think back for some of you at
[00:53] least um something like 20 years about
[00:54] the early days you bought a printer you
[00:57] bought a scanner or whatever and then
[00:58] you had to plug it onto your machine and
[01:00] get it connected somehow and get it to
[01:02] talk and it never worked and your
[01:04] parents called you and all that
[01:06] and
[01:07] so then they came up first of all with
[01:09] plug and play and then for the network
[01:10] universal plug-and-play i mean
[01:13] the idea is quite obvious what you want
[01:14] to have is that device that you just
[01:17] put on your network and it all works and
[01:19] it's magic and if you you know your
[01:21] parents can do it
[01:22] and
[01:23] well that's what what it was designed
[01:26] like so
[01:28] what you really need to remember about
[01:29] it what's the important point about it
[01:31] is
[01:31] there's no authentication there's no no
[01:34] passwords no anything there's no
[01:35] usernames no stuff
[01:37] it's just talking to each other and if
[01:40] there's a you know server client
[01:42] um
[01:43] it will provide functionality to whoever
[01:45] connects to it and there's no levels
[01:48] between you know regular users or or
[01:51] administrators or whatever because that
[01:52] would assume that you have passwords in
[01:54] between which you don't
[01:56] so if there's your pnp device
[01:58] see what it can do for you and quite
[02:00] often there's a lot
[02:03] um
[02:04] yeah
[02:05] it's not so much maybe you will wonder
[02:07] if you see this on a like on a company
[02:10] network
[02:11] it's mostly for residential use really
[02:13] but if you're looking around for example
[02:15] right now you have the overhead
[02:17] projectors nowadays you mean all your
[02:19] printers all your tvs here these l
[02:22] routers and everything else they're all
[02:23] talking upnp your phones the
[02:25] applications there's a lot of them and
[02:28] upmp is probably one of the most widely
[02:30] deployed protocols on the local networks
[02:33] and sort of sadly also on the internet
[02:36] because no one stopped it
[02:38] um
[02:39] yeah it's a combination of you know sstp
[02:42] there's http i think
[02:44] it's partly based on udp it's partly
[02:47] based on tcp
[02:48] and it all works together quite
[02:50] amazingly and provides all sorts of
[02:52] functionality in the end
[02:54] um
[02:55] yeah so
[02:56] first of all how does it work
[02:59] basically you have your operating system
[03:01] let's say
[03:02] windows and it wants to find out what
[03:04] kind of upnp devices there are on the
[03:07] local network so that's what it does it
[03:09] sends out a single udp packet port 1900
[03:12] multicast address and it's uh that's the
[03:14] what do you see down there the m search
[03:17] it's are there any upnp devices on this
[03:20] network if so please reply
[03:23] and that's what you get back that's your
[03:25] reply also edp
[03:26] coming from the devices look something
[03:28] like this
[03:29] the interesting part is the red part
[03:31] where it specifies well yes i'm over
[03:33] here if you want to talk to me and if
[03:35] you want to find out what i can do for
[03:37] you what kind of services i offer and
[03:40] what kind of functionality
[03:42] um
[03:43] you connect to my http port on you know
[03:47] ipport whatever and there's an xml file
[03:49] waiting for you you know just download
[03:51] the file pass it and it's all in there
[03:54] what i can do for you
[03:56] um
[03:57] yes so yeah exactly that's this part
[03:59] actually so your windows the next step
[04:01] is going to be it will connect to this
[04:03] advertised http port will download the
[04:06] xml file
[04:07] and then find out so what kind of device
[04:09] am i actually talking to what is this
[04:11] what does it offer and then you see it
[04:13] on your system tray of similar
[04:16] depends on the functionality of course
[04:18] oh yes
[04:19] i know it's hard to read it's small
[04:21] that's intentional by the way don't even
[04:22] read it
[04:23] you get a whole lot of information in
[04:25] these xml files
[04:27] i
[04:28] remove the you know the clutter
[04:30] basically and that's part of what you
[04:31] get so what you see in this case for
[04:34] example so what kind of device is it oh
[04:36] well it's a residential it's an internet
[04:38] gateway device oh it's manufactured by
[04:40] linksys um it's you see the model you
[04:43] even see the software version isn't that
[04:45] amazing if you're an attacker knowing
[04:47] you know very detailed what you're
[04:49] talking to and then you can just google
[04:51] for exploits basically
[04:53] um
[04:54] yeah european peer pac attacks there's a
[04:56] whole bunch
[04:59] ddos was quite famous for a while
[05:02] um
[05:03] if you think back once again there's a
[05:04] udp packet a single packet going out and
[05:07] then there's a reply coming back
[05:09] so that's quite ideal for you know your
[05:12] normal amplification attacks because the
[05:14] udp is easily spoofable so you send out
[05:17] a small packet requesting information
[05:19] from a upnp device
[05:21] and you get back a sort of beautiful a
[05:23] bigger packet announcing all sorts of
[05:25] services so you just move the source ip
[05:28] to whatever victim you want to hit and
[05:31] well and direct a whole lot of traffic
[05:33] this way and this was quite quite in use
[05:36] on the internet for a while until they
[05:38] switch to ntp and
[05:40] and well whatever stuff it's nowadays
[05:44] in general upnp you saw the xml
[05:48] they offer all sorts of functionality
[05:50] which means there's interfaces different
[05:53] interfaces uh providing different
[05:55] functions
[05:58] and
[05:59] unlike zeroconf as far as i know upnp is
[06:02] more like a platform so it's every
[06:04] window can basically just use the upnp
[06:07] functionality
[06:09] and then implement their own whatever
[06:10] they want to have on top of it so there
[06:13] you have it's not standardized
[06:15] basically whatever device you order they
[06:17] have different functions under different
[06:19] names with different functionality
[06:21] and
[06:23] it's really it's sort of amazing
[06:24] whatever you find in these devices
[06:27] for example so once again there's no
[06:29] authentication no whatever if you can
[06:32] talk to it you can use all the
[06:34] functionality it offers
[06:36] so for example if a bunch of devices
[06:38] offering you to remotely change the dns
[06:40] settings
[06:42] well if you're talking to the local
[06:44] router on the on the network and you can
[06:46] change the dns settings without being
[06:48] you know not logging in being
[06:49] administrate or anything you just
[06:52] send a plain text request to the upnp
[06:54] interface can you please change the dns
[06:56] to this server which is under my control
[06:59] and you get backer http 200 yeah sure
[07:01] why not
[07:03] it's
[07:04] sort of scary i guess as a defender
[07:06] but it gets better
[07:08] the requesting ppp username and password
[07:12] that's not
[07:13] you know sort of
[07:14] well
[07:15] let's call it a feature because it's
[07:17] even in the standard that's defined in
[07:19] the upnp docs if you read them
[07:22] so
[07:22] same stuff
[07:24] plain text request well actually this
[07:25] one interface and i'm calling the
[07:28] ppp password function can you please
[07:31] send it over
[07:32] and well
[07:35] simple soap request in the http
[07:37] interface
[07:38] you see the event ppp connection
[07:41] interface being called in the get
[07:42] password function
[07:45] simple stuff that's the reply and sure
[07:47] enough why not here's the password
[07:50] once again no authentication just you
[07:52] know talk to it it's it's a feature
[07:54] that's what i mean about
[07:56] functionality um
[07:58] what else do we have oh yeah that was
[08:00] fun too um what about remotely changing
[08:02] the admin password of course without
[08:04] having the old one in the first place
[08:06] because some vendors think that's a good
[08:08] idea um that's what you find out there
[08:12] um
[08:13] yeah that's another one that was a quite
[08:15] big vendor actually i don't know how
[08:17] many devices implemented this one
[08:19] but
[08:20] it was remotely possible to on one hand
[08:23] request the wi-fi the ssid and also the
[08:27] plain text wi-fi password because why
[08:29] not
[08:30] um
[08:32] yeah
[08:33] upnp amazing stuff
[08:36] and like i said it's
[08:37] every vendor seems it by on its own and
[08:41] provide its own functionality and
[08:44] we'll get to auditing it later and how
[08:46] we have a look at it and see what kind
[08:47] of functions your device may offer
[08:50] that was one fun that one was quite
[08:52] fantastic
[08:54] so i mean upnp is designed for
[08:56] residential use for you know home
[08:58] networks and similar
[09:00] there's basically there's no point in
[09:03] upmp being provided on your these io
[09:06] routers on the internet
[09:07] side on the you know on the van
[09:09] interface
[09:10] um
[09:11] for whatever reason seems to be the
[09:13] default so you have millions of devices
[09:15] out there on internet really
[09:18] happily speaking upmp to you over the
[09:20] network over the internet that is
[09:22] including i mean upnp a big part of the
[09:25] functionality is when you're running
[09:27] applications or games also on your local
[09:29] network on the inside
[09:30] so it can talk to the router for example
[09:33] hey
[09:34] i would need a port forward i need this
[09:36] external port forwarded to me can you do
[09:38] this for me please that would be so
[09:40] great
[09:41] now the fun part is of course if this
[09:43] also works over the internet and it does
[09:46] so it means you have a you know you can
[09:48] talk to it over the internet could you
[09:50] please open this external port and
[09:52] forward it to the inside to this ip
[09:54] address and yeah sure why not
[09:57] um so it's you know whatever there was
[10:00] devices
[10:01] they're being sold quite often as well
[10:02] we're implementing our firewall and
[10:04] anti-hacker stuff and whatnot
[10:06] and then run upnp on the external
[10:08] interface and you can just ask for a
[10:10] connection to the inside
[10:12] now even better the ip address you
[10:15] specify doesn't have to be on the inside
[10:17] you can also specify an ip address on
[10:19] the on the external side on the internet
[10:21] so you can use it to just bounce around
[10:24] so you can talk to upnp can you please
[10:27] add port forwarding
[10:28] um
[10:29] forward port 25000 maybe to you know
[10:32] whitehouse.gov port 80 i'd like to do
[10:34] some stuff
[10:36] and
[10:37] yes it will do so
[10:39] and
[10:40] so that's not rare by the way that's
[10:43] a lot of devices doing this um yeah
[10:47] that's one of the requesting just you
[10:48] specify external port and internal port
[10:51] where you want to connect to the ip
[10:53] address
[10:54] and oh yeah least duration it's also fun
[10:56] i think it's the next slide actually
[10:57] yeah i mean those devices typically no
[10:59] logging
[11:00] um it's not just tcp you can also use it
[11:03] you know doing udp and also quite
[11:08] handy for an attacker there's a custom
[11:10] timeout that you can specify so the rule
[11:12] will be gone after a while
[11:17] yeah finding upmp devices on the
[11:19] internet
[11:20] um some years back in late 2012 h.g
[11:24] moore the guy behind the metasploit
[11:26] project
[11:27] he scanned the entire internet for upnp
[11:29] devices so at least you know finding the
[11:31] ones that wanted to talk to him and he
[11:33] found about 80 million devices something
[11:35] like 2 of the internet
[11:38] talking upnp over the internet talking
[11:40] to him because
[11:42] you had something like 7000 vendors back
[11:44] then already implementing upnp in a sort
[11:47] of creative way
[11:48] and
[11:49] 1500 vendors i suppose is many more by
[11:52] now so you can't just easily patch this
[11:54] it's not like you can talk to those 5 10
[11:57] 20 50 whatever vendors and get them to
[12:00] patch it
[12:01] then you have so many
[12:03] um
[12:05] yeah
[12:06] so what he was doing is sending these
[12:08] what we saw earlier the udp packet on
[12:10] port 1900
[12:11] basically uh
[12:14] what windows also sends on the local
[12:15] network it's a
[12:16] hi um are you a upnp device if so please
[12:19] talk back to me and tell me where to
[12:21] find the xml config
[12:23] and
[12:24] so of note which that's why i'm pointing
[12:26] it out here so i test this it doesn't
[12:29] work for windows um which also means if
[12:31] that's not windows house replying those
[12:34] 80 million devices
[12:36] there was all sorts of embedded devices
[12:37] where there's printers network attack
[12:39] storage
[12:40] um routers of course and many many of
[12:42] them and tvs and digital video recorders
[12:45] and cameras and everything else
[12:48] um which was later used by the way when
[12:50] was the mirror botnet it sounds like two
[12:52] years ago the iot botnet it was used for
[12:55] ddos um that's was a whole lot of these
[12:57] devices also yeah
[12:59] um
[13:01] once again also so udp to port 1900 are
[13:04] you a upnp device udp back yes i am my
[13:08] high port tcps over there that's where
[13:10] all the functionality is that's where
[13:12] you talk to and
[13:13] where you you know get your whatever you
[13:15] want to do that's all tcp
[13:18] that means just because port 1900 udp is
[13:21] blocked and you can't talk to it
[13:23] it doesn't mean you cannot talk to the
[13:25] upnp device if the tcp high port is open
[13:29] still
[13:30] and it's typically just a range of ports
[13:32] and always you know sort of a
[13:34] four or five different names for the xml
[13:36] basically you can just probe for it
[13:38] basically without using udp so even if
[13:40] some sort of firewall a provider so it's
[13:42] blocking udp 1900
[13:44] that does not mean that it's you know
[13:47] there might still be um the tcp port for
[13:50] the upnp interface for the soap
[13:52] interface open port 5000 for example and
[13:55] willing to accept commands
[13:58] um yeah also html he had a look so
[14:02] most vendors are not implementing their
[14:04] own upnp stacks which is probably a good
[14:06] idea they're buying or using open source
[14:09] or using just a few different stacks
[14:11] really so he found there was four
[14:13] different
[14:15] software development kits used in the
[14:17] three-quarters of these devices
[14:19] that also means of course when you find
[14:20] a vulnerability in one of these
[14:23] libraries
[14:25] that's good enough to attack millions of
[14:27] devices
[14:28] it's sort of critical that way
[14:31] oh yes then of course client-side
[14:33] vulnerabilities
[14:34] so
[14:36] so far what he had the typical approach
[14:38] is
[14:40] operating system sending out a multicast
[14:42] packet on local network are there any
[14:44] upnp devices
[14:45] and the device replying with yes sure
[14:47] i'm over here and my
[14:50] tcp interface is on this http port
[14:53] but
[14:54] according to the standard
[14:56] the client the you know your printer for
[14:58] example
[14:59] may do so on a periodic basis and do
[15:02] just the same you know without being
[15:04] requested just send out the multicast
[15:06] packet well actually i'm a upmp device
[15:09] i'm over here if you want to talk to me
[15:11] my http is up there and you know just
[15:14] find out what i can do for you
[15:16] so that's what i was doing and sending
[15:18] these packets to the internet just
[15:20] announcing myself as a upnp device hi
[15:22] i'm a upnp device i have a http port if
[15:25] you want to talk to me you know just
[15:27] connect
[15:29] so once again if you think about this it
[15:31] means i'm sending on an easily spoofable
[15:34] udp packet announcing a http service and
[15:38] you wouldn't believe how many requests i
[15:39] got back downloading the xml file
[15:44] so that means i can get
[15:47] millions
[15:48] of devices to connect to an http server
[15:51] of my choice
[15:53] it doesn't have to be mine it's not
[15:54] connecting back to the source ip address
[15:56] it's connecting back to whatever has
[15:58] been specified in the udp packet
[16:01] so i can get it to you know
[16:02] execute malicious requests on remote
[16:04] sites
[16:05] for you know exploitation or for dos
[16:08] i was wondering about the click fraud
[16:10] really um if i set up a website and you
[16:12] know include some sort of ban
[16:14] advertisement
[16:15] and then get a bunch of iot devices to
[16:18] connect you know to click it
[16:20] um
[16:21] well
[16:22] it may or may not work it didn't try it
[16:26] um in general of course you get
[16:30] clients you get software to download an
[16:31] xml file
[16:33] that you created that you specified we
[16:36] all know xml is sort of
[16:38] hard to pass especially if you really
[16:39] get into it
[16:41] so
[16:42] there might be malicious xml files that
[16:44] you can craft to potentially execute
[16:47] code
[16:49] that's just a bunch of user agents that
[16:50] i saw connecting back to me it was
[16:52] interesting behavior you saw five
[16:54] volatiles obviously because i was trying
[16:56] to connect back and find out what i well
[16:58] what was talking to me
[17:00] and wouldn't accept any connections
[17:02] but it would happily reply to my udp
[17:05] packet and connect back to me and
[17:06] download the xml
[17:08] um yeah so network attached storage i
[17:10] saw some business gateways
[17:13] um and many many more you know all sorts
[17:15] of bigger and smaller iot devices
[17:17] basically
[17:19] um attacking client applications now
[17:22] that's research from a colleague of mine
[17:24] it's alexander nikolich
[17:26] and um when i was doing my stuff he was
[17:29] well auditing uh upnp client-side
[17:33] library
[17:34] because
[17:35] you know you have applications like it
[17:38] doesn't have to be games there's also um
[17:41] basically whatever needs to exchange
[17:43] data over network and receive a remote
[17:45] connection from the internet
[17:46] will want to talk to your router
[17:48] especially to do what we saw earlier and
[17:50] request support forward so connection
[17:52] can come back in
[17:54] so that's what he was having a look at
[17:57] and
[17:59] yeah he saw he found a torrent clients
[18:01] cryptocurrency using upnp
[18:04] and running you know a bunch of
[18:06] libraries and he audited it
[18:09] um which one is it the
[18:12] was mini upnp i guess this one yeah
[18:15] that's when he audited um it's in
[18:17] widespread use for many different
[18:18] clients
[18:19] and
[18:20] he actually found a bug in there in the
[18:22] xml parsing
[18:25] so
[18:26] this code that he audited and where he
[18:28] found a park is or was being used at
[18:30] least and on the top left that's
[18:32] transmission it's a torrent client
[18:35] um top right bitcoin we all know what
[18:37] that is
[18:38] and
[18:39] tor
[18:40] used to use it that was quite
[18:42] interesting because
[18:43] a bit earlier they removed it from the
[18:46] cold base in the road something like um
[18:48] the c code here was fine but frankly we
[18:50] don't trust the underlying libraries
[18:52] and yeah they were right about it
[18:54] actually
[18:56] so what he found was an overflow in the
[18:58] xml parser
[19:00] which means
[19:03] your i mean your typical setup is he
[19:05] wrote an exploit to act as a upnp server
[19:08] on the local network and it was just
[19:11] sorry just um
[19:13] waiting for your typical upnp packet to
[19:16] arrive you know something like are there
[19:17] any devices i would like to talk to one
[19:20] so and he would reply yeah sure i'm over
[19:22] here there's my xml file come and get it
[19:25] and that's what happened so the
[19:27] application fetches the xml
[19:30] starts passing it
[19:31] um there was a mem copy and
[19:34] buffer overflow
[19:35] and he managed to
[19:37] execute code on the application
[19:39] now the fun application that he decided
[19:41] to exploit back then was bitcoin
[19:43] so that means he was able to take over
[19:46] bitcoin clients over the local network
[19:48] the moment the bitcoin main client
[19:50] started up it would do you know send out
[19:52] a upnp request
[19:53] is there any upnp device on the network
[19:56] um the exploit would reply yeah sure my
[19:59] xml file is over there
[20:00] um trigger the exploit um
[20:03] take over the client it's you know sort
[20:05] of a could be an expensive bug
[20:11] fixed pen of course demo um we'll skip
[20:14] this for now actually maybe in the end
[20:16] we had some technical problems while
[20:18] setting everything up so
[20:20] maybe not
[20:21] um yes auditing upnp so
[20:27] if you're on your home network or also
[20:29] in the company it's quite interesting
[20:30] really to just fire up wireshark and
[20:33] look for udp packets on port 1900
[20:35] because they're quite a bunch of them
[20:37] flying around always from
[20:39] from your colleagues from operating
[20:40] systems you know just like
[20:42] windows linux whatever but also you
[20:44] realize that you have devices on the
[20:46] network like what is that oh wait that's
[20:47] an um
[20:50] that's an apple what's the thing you
[20:51] call the media center
[20:54] sorry
[20:55] no the apple media center the small box
[20:57] apple tv yes thanks apple tv for example
[21:00] on and you know and similar
[21:02] that's just stuff that's on on regular
[21:04] networks and
[21:05] asking for upnp so
[21:08] if you want to find out what kind of
[21:09] functionality a upnp device is offering
[21:12] um there's a little tool called miranda
[21:16] written pyson
[21:18] miranda is very helpful because it will
[21:20] connect
[21:21] and you can just
[21:23] a bit like in a browser i mean it's text
[21:25] interface but still you can just connect
[21:27] to your device and map all the different
[21:29] functions see what kind of interfacial
[21:31] intel sorry what kind of functions the
[21:33] interfaces provide you can call the
[21:35] functions you can provide parameters you
[21:38] can change settings and so on
[21:40] and
[21:41] that's quite helpful
[21:47] defense
[21:50] i mean yeah patching obviously or just
[21:53] removing it if possible would probably
[21:55] be even better
[21:57] ids ips rules will help
[22:00] mostly
[22:01] um
[22:02] not my preferred solution really like i
[22:04] said if you can just disable it remove
[22:06] it
[22:07] it's just not a good idea to run it
[22:09] really
[22:10] what else yeah general sanity
[22:13] no one needs to run upnp on an external
[22:15] interface to be reachable over the
[22:17] internet
[22:18] if you're doing that you're just doing
[22:20] it wrong really
[22:22] um
[22:23] same goes for port forwarding of course
[22:26] uh port forwarding requests from the
[22:28] outside to the inside that's not
[22:30] functionality it should even be possible
[22:32] for whatever reason millions of devices
[22:33] will happily do it
[22:35] um yeah and yeah like i said patches but
[22:38] we all know how that works
[22:41] um conclusion yeah upnp is amazing it's
[22:44] the best protocol ever if you're an
[22:46] attacker
[22:48] if not if you're a defender like i guess
[22:50] most of the room
[22:51] um
[22:52] do something about it
[22:54] disable if possible
[22:57] um
[22:58] thanks a lot for now if you have any
[23:00] questions go ahead
[23:02] and
[23:04] yeah you might try the demo later
[23:07] okay
[23:14] okay first of all thank you for a very
[23:16] interesting talk i'm gonna have to try
[23:17] some of that stuff
[23:19] so are there any questions
[23:26] so uh thanks for the talk uh
[23:29] you could have uh
[23:31] tell us all this about
[23:33] five years six years ago yeah
[23:36] and uh it's right the same it kept the
[23:39] same
[23:40] and i wonder uh there is only a bunch of
[23:43] i don't know five or six uh
[23:46] really deployed upnp stacks and i don't
[23:49] know uh back then six years ago
[23:52] uh there were only two with known
[23:54] authors and uh the rest was unknown did
[23:58] anything change uh
[24:00] from what i saw the the hd moore uh
[24:04] graphic uh is that it doesn't change uh
[24:07] so there are still
[24:09] several
[24:10] uh
[24:10] [Music]
[24:12] several upmp stacks that uh that have no
[24:15] known
[24:16] author
[24:18] you know how it is it's the whole never
[24:20] changer running system
[24:22] and it always is about money in the end
[24:24] it's cheap to use software it just sort
[24:26] of works
[24:29] i don't think it really change i'm
[24:31] really waiting mostly for the protocol
[24:32] to be phased out and replaced by
[24:34] something else it's a mess
[24:37] is there any software to uh
[24:39] to check which upnp stack is implemented
[24:43] sorry sandy what is there any any any
[24:45] software uh that can remotely check the
[24:49] the upnp stack that is implemented
[24:54] like i said i mostly i use miranda for
[24:57] auditing and i don't know any asset off
[24:58] there really okay but um
[25:01] yeah
[25:02] i'd go with miranda for the moment
[25:03] really thanks but you have all sorts of
[25:06] even in the same stacks
[25:07] vendors you know modify the code base so
[25:10] you have different replies from the same
[25:12] software
[25:13] different versions maybe also
[25:15] it's yeah it's hard to i don't know it's
[25:18] difficult really yeah
[25:21] any other questions
[25:29] um i'm wondering i'm seeing a lot of
[25:31] hotels never a lot of bonjour services
[25:33] also have you taken a look at them i
[25:36] haven't um as far as i know bonjour is
[25:38] more like i said that's the
[25:40] it's more static it doesn't allow you
[25:42] like upnp does to implement your own
[25:45] services or whatnot on top as far as i
[25:47] know brochure is more like you have to
[25:49] stick to the standard and nothing but
[25:50] the standard
[25:52] so it's probably also by upnp so
[25:55] so wide spread because that's the
[25:57] functionality you know that it offers
[25:59] it's um it's you know how it is it's a
[26:01] feature
[26:08] have you been looking into the feature
[26:10] of upmp support somehow of media
[26:14] streaming and
[26:16] they have a limited
[26:17] audio and video support and i guess they
[26:21] at least at either home cinema thing
[26:24] that kind of can stream for my mobile
[26:27] and
[26:28] yeah it somehow
[26:30] needs to transform this data and i guess
[26:32] this data can also be exposed because
[26:34] you have audio and video decoders on the
[26:36] on the client side i didn't have a close
[26:39] look at audio video and i remember
[26:42] it's my what was it
[26:44] dvd player whatever or something my home
[26:47] network as well it also offered upnp
[26:50] services i did have a look it's what you
[26:52] described that's here audio video
[26:55] streams like i said it didn't have a
[26:57] close look at it
[26:59] something else by the way that upnp
[27:00] provides is eventing
[27:02] so it reminds me of snmp so you can
[27:06] subscribe to events and have events you
[27:09] know when they happen
[27:10] send out packets to probably also
[27:12] sources that you specify somewhere so
[27:15] well
[27:18] it's basically something that should be
[27:19] looked at i guess really upnp eventing
[27:22] it could be something else where you
[27:23] trust you know a supplier single packet
[27:25] to um subscribe to an event um provide a
[27:28] source ip address and it's not yours and
[27:30] if there's plenty of events there might
[27:32] be plenty of packets
[27:36] another question
[27:39] sorry again um
[27:40] we had a discussion in our office
[27:42] because we have a sonos like this audio
[27:44] thing
[27:45] and i guess it's also somehow you upnp
[27:49] connected how do you isolate such
[27:52] devices because um
[27:53] um you need to connect with your phone
[27:56] at least
[27:57] to
[27:58] to the device and it's
[28:00] very complicated we had internal
[28:02] discussion about this how um put it on a
[28:05] different network but then you have
[28:06] always to switch and yeah it's not an
[28:09] easy easy task
[28:12] ah
[28:13] isn't that the the general problem about
[28:15] security versus
[28:18] yes exactly
[28:20] yeah
[28:21] maybe have a close look uh you know run
[28:24] miranda on it really would be interested
[28:25] to to see the results
[28:27] and maybe just in offering you know
[28:29] innocuous functions nothing special
[28:31] about it
[28:32] but um
[28:34] maybe it will you know spit out the
[28:35] admin password in plain text that's the
[28:37] same password like on the rest of your
[28:39] network i don't know
[28:41] um
[28:42] yeah but really run me miranda on it and
[28:45] see what happens
[28:47] and yeah just see what happens
[28:50] good luck
[28:54] more questions
[28:58] no more questions
[28:59] we still have eight minutes if you want
[29:01] to do yeah
[29:02] we could try the demo
[29:06] just
[29:08] i'm not very confident that it will work
[29:10] so what i have here is the the exploit
[29:13] my colleague wrote
[29:14] and
[29:16] i wonder if
[29:18] i can move this over here
[29:21] that's not too bad
[29:33] now i can't read it from here
[29:35] so
[29:37] that's the yeah that's the exploit it's
[29:39] already running um waiting for
[29:40] connections to come in
[29:42] and
[29:46] that's the other shell
[29:49] that's one probably that's the one i
[29:50] want so that's bitcoin that's the
[29:53] qt interface
[29:55] and
[29:56] when i hit enter it's going to you know
[29:58] start up you'll see the interface and i
[30:01] can just tell you it's sending out the
[30:02] upnp packet and the exploit will reply
[30:05] with the yeshua i'm over here grab the
[30:08] xml pass it have fun good luck and
[30:11] the i'm sorry the connect back shell is
[30:14] probably not going to work what you will
[30:16] see
[30:17] is
[30:18] well let's try it
[30:20] bitcoin starting up
[30:23] interface
[30:24] and yeah so here's your segfault
[30:28] and
[30:30] what do you see on the on the exploit
[30:32] side yeah exactly that's the shell which
[30:36] sadly did not work
[30:37] but the exploit is over here um so he
[30:41] like i said that's what he did he set it
[30:43] up on network to listen for the upnp
[30:45] packets
[30:46] reply send the exploit and well you saw
[30:49] the client crash trust me it worked for
[30:51] him
[30:52] and
[30:53] yeah
[30:54] bitcoin was quite an interesting target
[30:56] at least
[30:59] okay so um if nobody else has any
[31:01] questions then i have one more question
[31:03] go ahead yeah you said miranda can be
[31:05] used for auditing yeah um could it also
[31:07] be used to continuously monitor in your
[31:10] own network if a there are any upnp
[31:12] devices or if anyone
[31:14] answers to any upnp
[31:16] it's probably the wrong piece of
[31:18] software really i mean it will
[31:20] um you can list the devices it saw on
[31:22] the network so it will tell you yes you
[31:24] know the list of networks that it sorry
[31:27] devices which send out packets so far
[31:30] but you probably want something else
[31:32] maybe you know it's
[31:34] write a piece of code couple lines of
[31:36] code just basically you're listening
[31:39] that does that already you can't
[31:40] recommend anything that does that
[31:41] already no i can't okay because i can
[31:44] basically i could understand how people
[31:46] are now a little bit worried about the
[31:47] stuff that's in their networks and they
[31:49] might really
[31:50] might might want to think about that
[31:52] maybe but
[31:53] um yeah so you better start coding um
[31:56] yeah
[31:57] okay thank you thanks again for the
[31:59] great talk
[32:00] and
[32:01] yeah

Fig 0. Genexis Platinum 4410 Router

A quick run of a UPnP based credential exposure in Genexis Platinum 4410 v2.1.34H Home Router.

There are references to various blogs of super awesome folks in Infosec, huge shoutouts to you! Thank you for the awesome work!

CVE-2020–25988 has been published completely on 2nd December, 2020.

**Product:** Genexis Platinum 4410 Router v2.1
**Version Affected:** P4410-v2.1.34H
**Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
 **Base Score**: 6.5 Medium

**Description:**

While playing around with the ‘Genexis Platinum 4410 Router V2.1.34H’, it was found that network-adjacent attackers could fetch the credentials of the ‘admin’ user and use it to login to the router panel by querying the *upnp* service running on port 5555. The ‘X\_GetAccess’ action leaks the ‘admin’ user’s credentials in plaintext.

**Background:**

UPnP is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other’s presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise-class devices. [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play)]

The upnp stack has 6 layers:

1. Addressing
2. **Discovery**
3. **Description**
4. **Control**
5. Eventing
6. Presentation [[2](http://www.upnp-hacks.org/upnp.html)]

and it uses the following protocols:

* **SSDP**: *Simple Service Discovery Protocol*, for discovering UPnP devices on the local network.
* **SCPD**: *Service Control Point Definition*, for defining the actions offered by the various services.
* **SOAP**: *Simple Object Access Protocol*, for actually calling actions. [[3](https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2016/07/05/exploring-upnp-with-python/)]

Once a device (personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices) has been assigned an IP Address and the upnp services are enumerated, the description of the available UPnP services can be fetched (in XML format).

A user can then fetch the router details (eg. External facing IP Address, DNS Server IPs etc) by querying the UPnP service *actions,* using crafted POST messages based on the SOAP.

The description of a devices’ upnp services contains the possible ‘actions’ (similar to function calls) and in this case, one of the ‘actions’ that any adjacent network user could perform is ‘X\_GetAccess’ , to view the credentials of the ‘admin’ user. This does seem like a functionality at the beginning, but this can be abused since anyone on the same network (wireless or physical) can fetch the ‘admin’ user’s credentials.

**PoC:**

On looking around for tools related to UPnP testing, I found a tool ‘UPnP-Pentest Toolkit’ opensourced by the NCC Group [[4](https://github.com/nccgroup/UPnP-Pentest-Toolkit)].

Using the tool, one can discover devices that are based on UPnP and enumerate the device description. The device description is populated in an XML file and using the SOAP protocol, an attacker on the adjacent network [[5](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)] can request for and fetch the credentials of the ‘admin’ user.

![]()

Fig 1. List of ‘Actions’ (not comprehensive)

The action of interest is ‘**X\_GetAccess**’ and the request and response look like this (admin:idontwantyoutoseethis) -

![]()

Fig 2. Cleartext Credentials of ‘admin’ user.

Proof Of Concept [[Script](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49075)] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOMLavacqSI)] -

The above script is adapted from [*upnpy*](https://pypi.org/project/UPnPy/)module and works when there’s only one UPnP device on the network. (Well, you can specify which upnp device do you want to look into).

**Impact:**

An network adjacent attacker can fetch the cleartext credentials of ‘admin’ account and login to the router’s admin panel by sending a POST request to the UPnP Service running on port 5555 in Genexis Platinum 4410 Router V2.1.34H.

**Remediation:**

Uncheck the ‘Enable UPnP’, which is enabled by default out of the box. However, ISPs use UPnP remotely to upgrade firmwares, perform maintenance and troubleshooting tasks.

Fig 3. Uncheck ‘Enable UPnP’

**Notes:**

There are two CVEs on the same product but for an older version:

1. Authentication Bypass on login page due to client side validation: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6170>
2. Remotely change the WIFI access point’s password (CSRF): <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25015>

As you may have noticed, the above two issues do not discuss the UPnP service and the second one is based on a 1-Click Password change. Upon checking for the above two security issues on the router that I had, none were found in the updated version.

Throughout the process of finding things on Google, I learned that UPnP is more of a feature but then, it has been abused by [botnets](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/br/security/news/internet-of-things/mirai-variant-spotted-using-multiple-exploits-targets-various-routers) and in [amplification attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ssdp-ddos-attack/). I stumbled upon great content from [Bsides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rseMaljMcBY) and learned andfetched my [zeroth](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25988) CVE.

So, what do you do when you have a router in your home?

Drink all the juice and hack all the things!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
