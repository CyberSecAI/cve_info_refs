Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `scanServer64` module of Trend Micro Apex One. This allows a local attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory locations outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system by reading data outside the intended buffer boundaries.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The advisory mentions that an attacker can combine this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code as SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **User-Supplied Data:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing maliciously crafted user-supplied data to the `scanServer64` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must have pre-existing low-privileged code execution on the target machine. They do not need to be in a privileged account.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro Apex One.
*   Trend Micro has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported this vulnerability to Trend Micro.
