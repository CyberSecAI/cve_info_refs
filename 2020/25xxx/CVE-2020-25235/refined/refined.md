Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The password used for authentication for the LOGO! Website and the LOGO! Access Tool is transmitted in a format that can be recovered by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper protection for the transmitted password, allowing it to be easily recovered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who captures the network traffic can recover valid login credentials for the LOGO! Website and LOGO! Access Tool.
- This could allow the attacker to access and potentially manipulate the device’s configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have network access to the affected LOGO! device and be able to capture the network traffic.
- No specific user interaction is required, the attacker only needs to passively capture traffic while an authentication attempt is made.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory indicates that the password is sent in a "recoverable format," although the advisory does not specify the exact format (e.g., clear text, reversible encryption, weak hashing).
- The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability is 5.9, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C.
- The vulnerability affects the LOGO! Website and LOGO! Access Tool, indicating these are separate applications that use the affected authentication method.
- The discoverer of the vulnerability is Max Bäumler.
