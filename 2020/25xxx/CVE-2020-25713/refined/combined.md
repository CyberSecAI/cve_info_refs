# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1900#c0)  olli.saarela    1999-03-31 08:08:41 UTC  ``` Function readtcp() in sunrpc/svc_tcp.c has recently(?) been optimized for situations with competetive client calls. This optimization fails when the clients send large data items to the client. ("Large" probably meaning data which RPC has split to several read() blocks, in our case, a struct with arrays of several thousand double elements).  When readtcp() is reverted back to the old version, everything works well again. (= call to svc_getreqset() is removed and readfds=svc_fdset; is replaced by FD_ZERO(&readfds);)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1900#c1)  Preston Brown    1999-03-31 22:50:59 UTC  ``` this could be nasty.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1900#c2)  Cristian Gafton    1999-07-09 22:21:59 UTC  ``` Is this bug still valid? Can we have a test case for the failure?  For now, "it works for me". The glibc-2.1.2-1 package that will be available from rawhide shortly does include a number of RPC fixed. Can you also test that?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1900#c3)  olli.saarela    1999-07-19 07:51:59 UTC  ``` The glibc-2.1.2-1 package has fixed this bug. I wrote a test case (5 files, 10 kB), and can provide it to anyone interested.  I don't want to "Reopen bug", but there is no way to unchek it from the radio button below.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1900#c4)  Cristian Gafton    1999-07-28 05:16:59 UTC  ``` Fixed in glibc-2.1.2-1 and later.   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).
