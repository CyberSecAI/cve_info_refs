Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-25733, CVE-2020-25734, and CVE-2020-25735:

**CVE-2020-25733: File Upload Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or restrict file uploads, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files. While the application attempts to block `.php` uploads, this can be bypassed by uploading other executable file types (e.g., `.exe` on a Windows system).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Unrestricted file upload, insufficient file type validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute malicious files on the server, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a malicious executable file via the `/webtareas/linkedcontent/addfile.php` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to upload files.

**CVE-2020-25734: File Listing Directory**

*   **Root cause:** The `/webtareas/files/Default/` directory is publicly accessible, allowing unauthenticated users to view a list of uploaded files.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Insecure directory listing, lack of access controls for the upload directory.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of files uploaded by authenticated users. This vulnerability is used in conjunction with CVE-2020-25733 to locate the uploaded executable files, or could expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** Accessing the `/webtareas/files/Default/` directory via a web browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is needed to access the directory listing.

**CVE-2020-25735: Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts in various input fields.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding for multiple input fields.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields on various pages. The article lists multiple vulnerable pages and input fields.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable pages and interact with the input fields.

**Additional notes:**

*   The article highlights how the file upload vulnerability (CVE-2020-25733) and the file listing directory (CVE-2020-25734) can be combined to achieve remote code execution. By uploading an executable and then using the file listing to locate it, an attacker can execute the file by triggering it with a specially crafted `.shtml` file.
*   The article lists multiple vulnerable input fields vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via the following pages `/webtareas/clients/editclient.php`, `/webtareas/extensions/addextension.php`, `/webtareas/administration/add_announcement.php`, `/webtareas/administration/departments.php`, `/webtareas/administration/locations.php`, `/webtareas/expenses/claim_type.php`, `/webtareas/projects/editproject.php`, `/webtareas/general/newnotifications.php`.
