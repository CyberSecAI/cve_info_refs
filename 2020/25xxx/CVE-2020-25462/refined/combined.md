[`5639abb`](/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/commit/5639abb24b6d725554969dc0be5822edb54a4a08)

* BLE does not invoke `onDisconnected` when no connection establiished
* On M5Stack, use GPIO 33 to distinguish screen type to determine if inversion is needed
* On ESP32, quiet `phy_init` logging to error level to reduce size of instrumented logs
* On ESP32, enable multicore by default
* ESP8266 targets default to 40 MHz `dio` for maximum compatibility. Moddable One and Moddable Three targets still run at 80 MHz `qio`
* Update "[Keeping Up To Date](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/blob/public/documentation/Moddable%20SDK%20-%20Keeping%20Up%20To%20Date.md)" guide for Python 3 on Linux
* XS JavaScript engine fixes overflow detection on `xsBeginHost` (and optimizes code to build stack frame)
* XS JavaScript engine fix crash when inspecting host stack frame in xsbug
* XS JavaScript engine fixes for [#432](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/issues/432) (reported by [@kvenux](https://github.com/kvenux))
* Suspend implemented for lwip and macOS socket
* HTTP client implements suspend method for flow control of incoming data
* Fix file name case mistake in Servo class [#436](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/pull/436) (from [@abparker](https://github.com/abparker))
