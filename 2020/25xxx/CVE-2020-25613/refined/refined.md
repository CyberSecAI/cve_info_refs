  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "WEBrick was too tolerant of invalid `Transfer-Encoding` headers, leading to potential inconsistencies in header interpretation between WEBrick and some HTTP proxy servers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "HTTP Request Smuggling",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to smuggle HTTP requests, potentially leading to data modification or other attacks depending on the application's logic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Transfer-Encoding` header to a vulnerable WEBrick server"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server"

  "affected_products": [
    "ruby versions 2.5.8 and prior (bundled WEBrick)",
    "ruby versions 2.6.6 and prior (bundled WEBrick)",
    "ruby versions 2.7.1 and prior (bundled WEBrick)",

  "remediation": [
    "Upgrade to webrick gem version 1.6.1 or later.",
    "Upgrade to ruby version 2.7.2 or later."
