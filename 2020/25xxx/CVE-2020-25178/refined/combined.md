### 4.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 4.2.1    [RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html)

Some commands used by the ISaGRAF eXchange Layer (IXL) protocol perform various file operations in the file system. Since the parameter pointing to the file name is not checked for reserved characters, it is possible for a remote, unauthenticated attacker to traverse an application’s directory, which could lead to remote code execution.

[CVE-2020-25176](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25176) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.2    [UNPROTECTED STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS CWE-256](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html)

ISaGRAF Runtime stores the password in plaintext in a file that is in the same directory as the executable file. ISaGRAF Runtime reads the file and saves the data in a variable without any additional modification. A local, unauthenticated attacker could compromise the user passwords, resulting in information disclosure.

[CVE-2020-25184](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25184) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

ISaGRAF Workbench communicates with ISaGRAF Runtime using TCP/IP. This communication protocol provides various file system operations, as well as the uploading of applications. Data is transferred over this protocol unencrypted, which could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to upload, read, and delete files.

[CVE-2020-25178](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25178) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.4    [UNCONTROLLED SEARCH PATH ELEMENT CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)

ISaGRAF Runtime searches for and loads DLLs as dynamic libraries. Uncontrolled loading of dynamic libraries could allow a local, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability only affects ISaGRAF Runtime when running on Microsoft Windows systems.

[CVE-2020-25182](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25182) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 4.2.5    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

ISaGRAF Runtime includes the functionality of setting a password that is required to execute privileged commands. The password value passed to ISaGRAF Runtime is the result of encryption performed with a fixed key value using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) on an entered or saved password. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could pass their own encrypted password to the ISaGRAF 5 Runtime, which may result in information disclosure on the device.

[CVE-2020-25180](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-25180) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing, Energy, Water and Wastewater Systems
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Rockwell ISaGRAF Runtime vulnerabilities for Flygt MultiSmart

June 8, 2021

Overview & Impact

Rockwell Automation recently announced security vulnerabilities which impact ISaGRAF
Runtime v5.x, which is a feature that can be enabled in the Flygt MultiSmart pump station
management system.

These vulnerabilities in Rockwell Automation’s software do not affect most MultiSmart
devices.

However, MultiSmart Gen-1 devices and MultiSmart Gen-2 devices running firmware prior to
version 3.2.0 contain a version of ISaGRAF 5.x. If ISaGRAF is enabled on those device, then
they might be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Users may refer to the MultiSmart Technical Product Information to determine their firmware
version (see Section 6.2.4 of the Installation, Operations, and Maintenance Manual). That
documentation also provides guidance on enabling and disabling the ISaGRAF feature (see
Section 6.2.5.40 of the Installation, Operations, and Maintenance Manual).

Certain pump operation architectures with MultiSmart are vulnerable if the ISaGRAF feature is
enabled, and could allow unauthorized users to read, download, or delete content from the
device.  Please refer to the recommendations in the mitigation section below to reduce the risk
of these vulnerabilities.

MultiSmart devices are NOT affected by the vulnerabilities if:

  They were purchased in the last 7 years (since 2014).
  They are running firmware versions 3.2.0 or later.
  The ISaGRAF feature has not been enabled. (It is disabled by default.)

Affected Products and Versions

ISaGRAF Runtime v5.x

  MultiSmart Gen-1 devices

  Please consult with Xylem’s Flygt Transport Team for assistance with upgrading the

hardware.

Xylem also recommends a comprehensive defense-in-depth strategy to reduce the risk of these
vulnerabilities.  This means employing adequate network segmentation and security controls
including, but not limited to:

  Restricting network connections and confirming the devices are not accessible from the

Internet.

  Harden workstations that connect to the MultiSmart devices (e.g., maintain Endpoint

Detection & Response solutions, application whitelisting, remove administrative rights).
  Ensuring control devices are behind firewalls and isolated from the enterprise/business

network or any other wide-area network.

  Continuously monitor affected devices for security events that could warn of attempted

unauthorized use.

  Strictly managing remote access and any privileged access to all devices that can

connect to the MultiSmart.
