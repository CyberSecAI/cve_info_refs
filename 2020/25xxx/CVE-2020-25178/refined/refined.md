Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25178:

**Vulnerability:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)

*   **Root Cause:** ISaGRAF Workbench communicates with ISaGRAF Runtime using TCP/IP, and this communication protocol transmits data unencrypted.
*   **Weakness:** The lack of encryption in the communication protocol exposes sensitive data transmitted between the ISaGRAF Workbench and ISaGRAF Runtime.
*   **Impact:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could intercept the unencrypted communication and gain the ability to upload, read, and delete files on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically targeting the unencrypted TCP/IP communication between the ISaGRAF Workbench and ISaGRAF Runtime.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the affected system,
    *   No authentication is required.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to passively listen to the network traffic or inject malicious packets into the communication stream.
    *   The attacker needs to induce a user to perform an action (UI:R) by interacting with the vulnerable software to upload, read, or delete files.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The advisory from CISA mentions that the vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   Xylem's advisory confirms that MultiSmart devices using ISaGRAF are vulnerable if the ISaGRAF feature is enabled and running firmware prior to version 3.2.0. This corroborates that the impact of the cleartext transmission could allow unauthorized users to read, download, or delete content from the device.
