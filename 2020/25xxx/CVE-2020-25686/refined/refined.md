{
  "CVE-2020-25686": {
    "Description": "Multiple DNS query requests for the same resource name (RRNAME) by dnsmasq versions before 2.83 allows for remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic, using a birthday attack (RFC 5452), that can lead to DNS cache poisoning.",
    "Root cause": "When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not check if there is already a pending request for the same name and it forwards a new request for it. By default a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of check for existing pending requests for the same name before forwarding a new request.",
        "Lack of proper address/port check, which when combined makes forging replies easier for an off-path attacker.",
      "Lack of query resource name (RRNAME) checks, allowing remote attackers to spoof DNS traffic."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can abuse this issue to substantially reduce the number of attempts he would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq, leading to DNS cache poisoning.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Off-path attacker on the network.",
        "Open forwarders: For the approximately 1 million dnsmasq servers openly visible on the Internet, attacks through the Internet are very simple.",
        "Closed network with internal attacker: If a dnsmasq server is only configured to listen to connections received from within an internal network, and an attacker gains a foothold on any device in the network, the attacker would be able to perform the attack.",
        "Browser-based attack: Even if a dnsmasq server is closed off to the outside world, and is only configured to listen to connection received from within an internal network, if attackers are able to get a device within the network to browse to their website, they could perform the attack this way.",
        "Open Wi-Fi or wired network: If a dnsmasq server is only configured to listen to connections received from within an internal network but the network is open, such as an airport network or a corporate guest network, an attacker will be able to perform the attack."

    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An off-path attacker on the network needs to send forged replies.",
          "Affected software": "Dnsmasq versions before 2.83"
