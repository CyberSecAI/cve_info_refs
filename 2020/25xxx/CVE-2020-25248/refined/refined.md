```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Hyland OnBase server fails to properly sanitize and escape user input, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities. User-controlled input is directly concatenated into local file system calls without proper validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Path traversal vulnerability exists, allowing attackers to read and write arbitrary files on the server.
- Both read-only and write/append-only instances of the vulnerability are present.
- Vulnerable parameters are typically named "FileName."
- String.format and string concatenation are used in the code.

Impact of exploitation:
- Attackers can read configuration data and arbitrary files across the server.
- Attackers can append, create, and write to arbitrary files on the server.
- Attackers can upload malicious DLLs and backdoors.
- Potential for complete compromise of the server.

Attack vectors:
- Sending SOAP calls directly to vulnerable methods using vulnerable parameters (typically "FileName").

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Remote attacker can send SOAP calls directly to the vulnerable methods.
- No user privileges are initially required, but some instances may require "workview configuration privilege".

Additional details:
- Seven read-only instances and twelve write/append-only instances were found.
- The vulnerability was confirmed to exist in OnBase versions up to and prior to OnBase Foundation EP1 (tested: 19.8.9.1000) and OnBase 18 (tested: 18.0.0.32).
- Later versions of OnBase (18.0.0.37) were also confirmed to be vulnerable.
- EP3 may require additional privileges to exploit path traversal vulnerability.
- The write access is limited to the current resourcePath.
