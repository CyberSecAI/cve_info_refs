{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The affected products are vulnerable when an authenticated attacker runs a debug command, which can be sent to the patient reader and cause a heap overflow event within the MCL Smart Patient Reader software stack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap overflow could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the MCL Smart Patient Reader, potentially leading to control of the device.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker needs to be authenticated to send debug commands to the MCL Smart Patient Reader.",
         "Exploitation must be initiated within Bluetooth signal proximity of the vulnerable product."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to authenticate to the MCL Smart Patient Reader and send a crafted debug command."
