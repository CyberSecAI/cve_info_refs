{
  "CVE-2020-25650": {
    "Root cause": "The `spice-vdagentd` daemon maintains a hash map (`active_xfers`) that maps `task_ids` to UNIX domain socket connections. An arbitrary client can add entries to this hash map without proper validation or limits.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted entry creation in the `active_xfers` hash map.",
      "Lack of limit on the maximum amount of file transfers.",
      "No timeouts for file transfers."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unprivileged local user with access to the UNIX domain socket path (`/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`) can cause a memory denial-of-service by filling the `active_xfers` hash map. This can lead to an out-of-memory situation, affecting `spice-vdagentd` and potentially other processes. Additionally, a large number of entries can cause high load in `systemd-journald` and excessive disk space consumption.",
    "Attack vectors": "An unprivileged local user within the virtual machine can connect to the `spice-vdagentd` UNIX domain socket and send crafted messages to trigger the creation of entries in the `active_xfers` hash map.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged user inside the virtual machine with access to the `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock` UNIX domain socket is required."
