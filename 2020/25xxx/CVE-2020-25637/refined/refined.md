  "CVE-2020-25637": {
    "description": "A double free vulnerability was found in libvirt while requesting information about the network interfaces of a running domain. The flaw lies in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu/qemu_agent.c. More specifically, this function interacts with the guest agent and receives JSON data from the agent that contains network interface information. It enumerates the interfaces one by one, using a pointer to a pointers to hold a split interface name (ifname). At some point in every iteration ifname is free'd. If an error occurs right after this, there is a 'goto error', the error handler at this label will free ifname again, leading to a double free.",
    "root_cause": "Double free in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() due to an error condition after freeing memory, leading to a second free on the same memory.",

    "impact": "Denial of service due to libvirtd daemon crash, potentially leading to code execution if an attacker can control the heap state during the second free.",
