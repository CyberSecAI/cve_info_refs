| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1177155#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-09-30 16:59:40 UTC  ``` rh#1881037  A double free vulnerability was found in libvirt while requesting information about the network interfaces of a running domain. The flaw lies in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu/qemu_agent.c. More specifically, this function interacts with the guest agent and receives JSON data from the agent that contains network interface information. It enumerates the interfaces one by one, using a pointer to a pointers to hold a split interface name (ifname). At some point in every iteration ifname is free'd. If an error occurs right after this, there is a 'goto error', the error handler at this label will free ifname again, leading to a double free. Depending on the ability of the attacker to control and shape the heap state when the second free happens, this flaw may be exploited to achieve code execution.

Is it possible to skip SLE12 SP2? I'm afraid updating SLE-12-SP2 is inevitable, as it appears to be affected by the double free condition. At the very least commit a63b48c5ecef077bf0f909a85f453a605600cf05 should be applied, IMHO. QA will have to test manually if there are no automated tests available.  > > SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update  Affected > > SUSE:SLE-12-SP4:Update  Affected > > SUSE:SLE-12-SP5:Update  Affected > > SUSE:SLE-15:Update      Affected > > SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:Update  Affected > > SUSE:SLE-15-SP2:Update  Affected >  > I've added the patches to all of these products, and in some cases have > already sent the submit requests.

SUSE distros are not affected since we use polkit auth out-of-the-box. Even RO operations like 'list' require root password when invoked by normal users  skifaster@virt82:~> virsh -c qemu:///system list --all ==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.libvirt.unix.manage ==== System policy prevents management of local virtualized systems Authenticating as: root Password:  ==== AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE ====  Id   Name        State ---------------------------  2    rancherOS   running  The admin must disable polkit auth in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf by setting auth_unix_{ro,rw} to 'none' to trigger the issue, at which point they should also set appropriate permissions on the sockets. IMO we can close this as INVALID. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c4)  James Fehlig   2020-08-08 03:31:09 UTC  ``` FYI, a patch was posted upstream that for us (SUSE) provides a slight improvement in the comments regarding authorization and socket permissions in libvirtd.conf  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2020-August/msg00360.html>  I can add the patch, which again would be a doc change only, to SLE15 SP2 and Factory if you would like. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c5)  James Fehlig   2020-08-25 16:47:41 UTC  ``` I asked rather indirect questions in #3 and #4 but didn't set needinfo.

I think it would be a good idea to take that patch, so that users are aware of the risks involved with turning off polkit.   I will go ahead and change our tracking, because we are not affected by default. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c7)  James Fehlig   2020-09-11 21:53:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Robert Frohl from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c6)) > I think it would be a good idea to take that patch, so that users are aware > of the risks involved with turning off polkit.  In the end what was committed upstream is a bit more involved  <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/b196f8fcdddd08194f267b7a02d8541a653d894a>  To backport all of the patch requires changing the meson bits to autotools. Upstream libvirt recently ditched autotools in favor of meson but all supported SLE products have older libvirt that still uses autotools. Even the improved comments in libvirtd.conf assume the build-time bits of the patch are present. Here are some options, please let me know what you prefer:  1. Backport full patch functionality by porting the meson parts to autotools 2. Write a downstream patch for the older libvirts in our supported products that simply warns of the perils of disabling polkit auth. 3. Do nothing for existing products and get the improvement in SLE15 SP3 as we update libvirt.  If 1 or 2 is preferred, follow up question: How far back do you want the fix? I mean, do we care about a doc patch for old LTSS stuff? :-) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c8)  Robert Frohl   2020-09-28 08:42:17 UTC  ``` @Marcus: What do you think? Is it worth the effort for something that is not an issue by default ? Maybe just fixing it in newer versions of SLE/openSUSE would be sufficient ? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c9)  Marcus Meissner   2020-09-28 14:04:44 UTC  ``` What the patch does is basically what we currently have, and it only makes it adjustable.   It does not mitigate the problem in another way, it just brings either polkit enabled with mode 666 or "no polkit" with user based access settings.   I think we can document that our current setup is safe, perhaps add some strong words to our libvirt.conf , similar to the referenced patch.  But no need to backport this meson thing. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c11)  James Fehlig   2020-10-08 22:47:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 842434](attachment.cgi?id=842434&action=diff "doc patch for libvirtd.conf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=842434&action=edit "doc patch for libvirtd.conf") doc patch for libvirtd.conf ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c12)  James Fehlig   2020-10-08 22:52:36 UTC  ``` I've added the patch in #11 to the SLE12 SP5 and SLE15 SP{1,2} libvirt packages and submitted for maintenance. The Factory and SLE15 SP3 libvirt packages got the upstream variant referenced in #7. IMO it is sufficient to "fix" the bug in these distros, but feel free to reassign back to me if you disagree :-). ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1174955#c15)  James Fehlig   2020-10-13 20:28:25 UTC  ``` While working on CVE-2020-25637, I continued backporting the doc fix in this bug to SLE15 GA and SLE12 SP{2,3,4}.

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libvirt, a C toolkit to interact
with the virtualization capabilities of Linux, which could lead to
denial of service or information disclosure.

CVE-2020-10703

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API that is responsible for
    fetching a storage pool based on its target path.  In more detail, this flaw affects
    storage pools created without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster
    and RBD.  Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to
    crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service.

CVE-2020-12430

    A memory leak was found in the virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible
    for retrieving domain statistics when managing QEMU guests.  This flaw allows
    unprivileged users with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats
    command, resulting in a potential denial of service.

CVE-2020-25637

    A double free memory issue was found in the libvirt API that is responsible for
    requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain.  This flaw
    affects the polkit access control driver.  Specifically, clients connecting to the
    read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the
    libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their
    privileges on the system.  The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
    confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

CVE-2021-3631

    An issue was found in the generation of SELinux MCS category pairs for VMs' dynamic
    labels.  This flaw allows one exploited guest to access files labeled for another
    guest, resulting in the breaking out of sVirt confinement.

CVE-2021-3667

    An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API.  It
    occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj
    object is not properly released on ACL permission failure.  Clients connecting to the
    read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock
    and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial
    of service condition.

CVE-2021-3975

    A use-after-free issue was found in libvirt in qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF(), where
    the qemuMonitorUnregister() function is called using multiple threads without being
    adequately protected by a monitor lock.  This flaw could be triggered by the
    virConnectGetAllDomainStats API when the guest is shutting down.  An unprivileged
    client with a read-only connection could use this flaw to perform a denial of service
    attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.

CVE-2021-4147

    Jim Fehlig discovered that a malicious guest using the libxl driver could cause
    libvirtd on the host to deadlock or crash when continuously rebooting itself.

CVE-2022-0897

    A flaw was found in the libvirt nwfilter driver.  The virNWFilterObjListNumOfNWFilters
    method failed to acquire the driver->nwfilters mutex before iterating over
    virNWFilterObj instances.  There was no protection to stop another thread from
    concurrently modifying the driver->nwfilters object.  This flaw allows a malicious,
    unprivileged user to exploit this issue via libvirt's API virConnectNumOfNWFilters to
    crash the network filter management daemon (libvirtd/virtnwfilterd).

CVE-2024-1441

    An off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in
    libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array.  This
    issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon,
    allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the
    libvirt daemon to crash.

CVE-2024-2494

    The ALT Linux Team discovered that the RPC server deserialization code allocates
    memory for arrays before the non-negative length check is performed by the C API entry
    points.  Passing a negative length therefore results in a crash due to the negative
    length being treated as a huge positive number.  This flaw allows a local,
    unprivileged user to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon
    to crash.

CVE-2024-2496

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the udevConnectListAllInterfaces()
    function.  This issue can occur when detaching a host interface while at the same time
    collecting the list of interfaces via virConnectListAllInterfaces API.  This flaw
    could be used to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to
    crash.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.0.0-4+deb10u2.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-21 12:18:32 UTC  ``` A double free vulnerability was found in libvirt while requesting information about the network interfaces of a running domain. The flaw lies in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu/qemu_agent.c. More specifically, this function interacts with the guest agent and receives JSON data from the agent that contains network interface information. It enumerates the interfaces one by one, using a pointer to a pointers to hold a split interface name (ifname). At some point in every iteration ifname is free'd. If an error occurs right after this, there is a 'goto error', the error handler at this label will free ifname again, leading to a double free. Depending on the ability of the attacker to control and shape the heap state when the second free happens, this flaw may be exploited to achieve code execution.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-21 12:18:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Ilja Van Sprundel (IOActive)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-21 13:37:32 UTC  ``` Seems like this flaw was introduced way back in libvirt v1.2.14 with the following commit:   -> <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=0977b8aa071de550e1a013d35e2c72615e65d520>  As a side note, a recent update in version 6.7.0 replaced virStringListFree (responsible for freeing ifname) with g_strfreev():   -> <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=ee247e1d3fbfcf8d2aaff9447b79a65910bcf026>  This change didn't have any repercussions on the impact of this flaw, though.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-21 13:59:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected by this issue as they shipped an older version of `libvirt` which did not include the vulnerable code. This flaw affects versions of the `libvirt` package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8. Future `libvirt` package updates for these products may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-28 08:17:42 UTC  ``` The check in virDomainInterfaceAddresses() in libvirt-domain.c prevents read-only clients from exploiting this flaw:  ``` if (source == VIR_DOMAIN_INTERFACE_ADDRESSES_SRC_AGENT)     virCheckReadOnlyGoto(dom->conn->flags, error); ```  This issue mostly involves a security boundary violation in the polkit access control driver: <https://libvirt.org/aclpolkit.html>. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions (i.e., read-only) could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-30 12:27:31 UTC  ``` Upstream commits: * <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=955029bd0ad7ef96000f529ac38204a8f4a96401> * <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=50864dcda191eb35732dbd80fb6ca251a6bba923> * <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=e4116eaa44cb366b59f7fe98f4b88d04c04970ad> * <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=a63b48c5ecef077bf0f909a85f453a605600cf05>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c9)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-30 12:30:06 UTC  ``` Created libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1883864](show_bug.cgi?id=1883864 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25637 libvirt: double free in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu_agent.c [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1883865](show_bug.cgi?id=1883865 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-25637 mingw-libvirt: libvirt: double free in qemuAgentGetInterfaces() in qemu_agent.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-11-10 13:13:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:5040 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5040](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5040)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1881037#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-10 14:21:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-25637 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25637)

#### Description

A double free memory issue was found to occur in the libvirt API, in versions before 6.8.0, responsible for requesting information about network interfaces of a running QEMU domain. This flaw affects the polkit access control driver. Specifically, clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

The failures are caused by downstream patches that tweak the settings in the various config files. I've adjusted the patches to include tweaking the augeas test files.  BTW, the problem was recently exasperated with a downstream variant of  <https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/b196f8fcdddd08194f267b7a02d8541a653d894a>  I've fixed that patch too and submitted to SLE15 SP2 maintenance, which eventually feeds Leap 15.2 maintenance.  The same problem plagues Factory and SLE15 SP1 / Leap 15.1. I'll be fixing those next. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1175574#c3)  James Fehlig   2020-10-14 17:55:08 UTC  ``` Now fixed in Factory, SLE15 SP3, SLE15 SP1 (Leap 15.1), and SLE12 SP5. Older distros are likely affected too, but I'll ignore those unless someone asks. I doubt folks will be rebuilding older libvirt packages using 'rpmbuild'. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1175574#c4)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-14 18:20:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1175574) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/841811> Factory / libvirt ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1175574#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-26 20:13:48 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:3037-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has four fixes is now available.

Error message:  ... libvirtd[1724]: internal error: Failed to autostart VM 'claude':  internal error: Process exited prior to exec: libvirt:  QEMU Driver error : Unable to get devmapper targets for  /s1/kvm/claude/claude-disc1.raw: Success (Multiple attempts to start VMs on multiple hosts gave a similar message.)  For libvirt bugs, exec virt-manager --debug and post the output. The GUI opens and a bunch of stuff, including the host and guest  configuration, come out on stdout/stderr.  Just for laughs I selected Claude and hit the "power on" triangle.  On stderr and also a pop-up, it showed the above message and a traceback, probably useless  because the problem isn't in virt-manager.  I've attached the output.  Here's a related bug report:  <https://www.spinics.net/linux/fedora/libvir/msg206635.html> OP Andrea Bolognani (Red Hat), 2020-08-04 Referring to a patch involving CVE-2020-14339 made by  Michal Privoznik, 2020-07-27 Jimc's summary: On a system with only plain partitions, no LVM (like mine), /proc/devices lacks an entry for dev-mapper which virdevmapper needs.  Without AppArmor the error message above is  seen; with AppArmor the message is about deleting a busy directory.  Workarounds mentioned: Set namespaces=[] in qemu.conf, but he implies that this may have baleful security issues maybe relating to the  leaked file descriptor mentioned in CVE-2020-14339.  To populate /proc/devices you could run (as root) dmsetup info (says no devices found, which we already knew) and the startup will work.  (jimc confirms this; it's block device 254 at the end.)    See the bug report for Andrea's offer of help in getting this fixed. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c1)  James Carter   2020-08-19 00:39:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 840787](attachment.cgi?id=840787 "Systemd unit to run dmsetup info ahead of libvirtd") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=840787&action=edit "Systemd unit to run dmsetup info ahead of libvirtd") Systemd unit to run dmsetup info ahead of libvirtd  I've put together a systemd unit that runs dmsetup info ahead of libvirtd. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c2)  James Fehlig   2020-08-19 19:55:06 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report. The issue has already been fixed upstream with this series  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2020-August/msg00521.html>  I've backported the patches and will submit an updated libvirt to Factory tomorrow. That gives you a bit of time to test the libvirt packages from our Factory devel project :-)  <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization/openSUSE_Factory/>  No worries if you are unable to do that. I'll submit to Factory tomorrow regardless. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c3)  James Fehlig   2020-08-20 15:12:08 UTC  ``` I've submitted the updated libvirt to Factory now. Please reopen the bug if you still see problems with the updated package. Thanks! ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c4)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-08-20 15:40:12 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1175465) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/828226> Factory / libvirt ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c5)  James Carter   2020-08-20 21:52:10 UTC  ``` I installed libvirt-daemon-6.6.0-903.1.x86_64 and 20 friends (and disabled my libvirtd-bug.J unit that runs "dmsetup info").  All guests start up OK.  Thanks for the quick work backporting the upstream patch.    In one case where I rebooted the host, with the guest not autostarted, and confirmed that /proc/devices did not include 254 dev-mapper, libvirtd could start the guest with no hassle, confirming that the original problem was fixed.  254 dev-mapper reappeared after the guest was started, which seems logical.   The new Factory submission hasn't made it through the build farm and I'll await its appearance in Tumbleweed.  Thanks again. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1175465#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-09-18 01:17:04 UTC  ``` SUSE-RU-2020:2674-1: An update that has one recommended fix can now be installed.
