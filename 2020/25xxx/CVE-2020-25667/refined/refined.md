Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `TIFFGetProfiles` function within the `coders/tiff.c` file of ImageMagick. This occurs because the function uses `strstr()` to search for `dc:format="image/dng"` within the `profile` data. Due to improper string handling of a raw C string, this can lead to an out-of-bounds read when a crafted input file is provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strstr()` with a raw C string instead of a `StringInfo` type.
- Out-of-bounds read.
- Improper string handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service due to the application crashing caused by the out-of-bounds read. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted TIFF input file is required to trigger the vulnerability when processed by ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted TIFF file to be processed by ImageMagick.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `strstr` function searches for a specific string within the profile data of a TIFF image.
- The fix for this issue involves using a `StringInfo` type instead of a raw C string to handle the profile data.
- This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7
- Inkscape is not affected because it no longer uses a bundled ImageMagick in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
