# Nagios-Log-Server-2.1.7-Persistent-Cross-Site-Scripting

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in [Nagios Log Server 2.1.7](https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-log-server/) can result in an attacker performing malicious actions to users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page.

[Nagios Log Server 2.1.7](https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-log-server/) and older versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

# CVE-2020-25385

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25385>

# PoC-1

To exploit vulnerability, someone could use a POST request to '/nagioslogserver/configure/create\_snapshot' by manipulating 'snapshot\_name' parameter in the request body to impact users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page.

```

### Real-Time Log Analysis and Network Security

Easily correlate log events across all servers and view data in real time to quickly resolve problems. Create alerts based on custom queries and thresholds to stay on top of security and network auditing.

Notify users via various methods, including Nagios XI / Nagios Core, email, SNMP traps, or script execution. Utilize historical archives of all events to keep your organization in compliance with security requirements.

### Log Data Threat Notifications

Simplify log data management by setting up alerts to notify you when potential threats arise or querying your data to quickly audit any system.

Easily configure your servers to send all log data with source setup wizards. Keep all log data accessible and safe with high availability and fail-over capabilities.

### Robust Scalability and Adaptability

Meet the needs of your organization, no matter the size. As your organization grows, you can effortlessly add more instances to your monitoring cluster to enhance power, speed, storage, and reliability.

With a fully accessible API, you can also integrate with third-party solutions or your current infrastructure to fit your needs.

### Advanced User Management and Customization

Create the ideal monitoring setup with multi-user capabilities. Admins can set access permissions and add, modify, or remove users. They can also grant specified users access to the external API via an access key.

 With a powerful GUI, users can tailor layout, design, and preferences on a per-user basis and create customized dashboards to share with a custom URL.

## Features
