Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SolarWinds N-Central software has a default support account (`support@n-able.com`) and a built-in admin account (`nableadmin@n-able.com`) that are active by default with fixed, default credentials on all installations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The presence of active default accounts with static credentials.
*   **Lack of Enforcement:** The software does not enforce the changing or deactivation of these default accounts upon installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the default credentials to log into the N-Central Administrative Console (NAC) and the regular web interface, gaining unauthorized access to the system.
*   **System Compromise:** This unauthorized access can be a stepping stone for further exploitation of other vulnerabilities or system compromise. The content also notes that the support user (with default credentials) can be used to authenticate to the NAC and exploit an RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-25617).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker with network access to the N-Central server can attempt to log in to the web interface or NAC using the known default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the N-Central server.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the default usernames and passwords for the support and admin accounts, which are stated in the content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content explicitly states the support account (`support@n-able.com`) can log into both the NAC and regular web interface, while the admin account (`nableadmin@n-able.com`) can only log into the NAC.
*   The content emphasizes the criticality of this vulnerability as SolarWinds itself suggests in their security whitepaper that the NAC needs to be exposed to the internet, thus exposing the vulnerable credentials.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in SolarWinds N-Central 2020.1 HF2.
