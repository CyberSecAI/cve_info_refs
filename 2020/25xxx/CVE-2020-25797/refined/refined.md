  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of user input on the authenticated part of the LimeSurvey application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and output encoding of the `firstname` and `lastname` parameters.",
     "The application accepts potentially dangerous input and embeds it back into the HTML response without sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `firstname` and `lastname` fields of a survey participant. When an administrative user views or edits the participant, the injected JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing cookies or session tokens, or redirecting them to a malicious site.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "method": "The attacker crafts malicious payloads in the 'firstname' and 'lastname' fields when adding or editing survey participants.",
      "location": "The vulnerability exists in the 'Add Participants' functionality of LimeSurvey, specifically when creating or editing participant records within a survey.",
      "exploit": "The attacker needs appropriate permissions (basic user role) to create a survey and add/edit participants."
    },
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a basic user role with the ability to create surveys and add or edit participants. An admin user does not need to be compromised."
