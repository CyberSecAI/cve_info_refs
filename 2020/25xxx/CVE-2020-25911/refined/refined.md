Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `_collectRequestParameters` function within `core\model\modx\rest\modrestservice.class.php` in ModxCMS. This function directly parses user-provided XML input without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. By sending a specially crafted XML payload, an attacker can exploit the `simplexml_load_string` function to include external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers can potentially read local files on the server by crafting malicious XML payloads that reference external entities.
- **DoS (Denial of Service) Attack:** Exploitation of the XXE vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service attack by potentially causing resource exhaustion or other unexpected behaviors by the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests with `Content-Type: text/xml`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and control the content of the request body with the correct content type.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippet highlights the vulnerable section in `_collectRequestParameters` where user input is read from php://input, and if the content type is set to `text/xml` the content is parsed directly using `simplexml_load_string` without any sanitization.
- The issue was identified and has been fixed (as mentioned in the first document). The fix was likely to sanitize user-provided XML data before parsing it.
