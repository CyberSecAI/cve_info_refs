### Insights vulnerability analysis

[View exposed systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves/CVE-2020-12351)

* Overview

## Executive summary

Red Hat is responding to three flaws (CVE-2020-12351, CVE-2020-12352, and CVE-2020-24490) in the Linux kernel. Two of those CVEs, CVE-2020-12351 and CVE-2020-12352, impact Red Hat Enterprise Linux. These flaws allow a remote attacker within Bluetooth range to perform a system crash, execute arbitrary code, or leak small portions of stack memory from the system. Red Hat customers using affected versions are recommended to apply mitigations and updates when available. Red Hat also recommends updating to the most recent images and latest versions of container host systems.

The first issue has been assigned [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) and rated with a severity impact of [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification).

The second issue has been assigned [CVE-2020-12352](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12352) and rated with a severity impact of [Moderate](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification).

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

Red Hat is also aware of a third vulnerability, [CVE-2020-24490](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-24490), which does not impact any of our released products except for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA. Please see below how Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 is being addressed.

To determine if your system is currently vulnerable to these flaws, see the Diagnose section below. Additionally, an Ansible playbook for automatic remediation is provided below.

### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA release

Red Hat was unable to include the fixes for the original CVE-2020-12351, CVE-2020-12352, and CVE-2020-24490 issues in the GA release, as the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA release was in the final stages of release preparation when the Bleeding Tooth issues were made public.

New Red Hat only CVEs have been assigned for CVE-2020-12351 and CVE-2020-12352 to track the regressions caused by the missing Bleeding Tooth fixes. To track the CVE-2020-12351 regression, [CVE-2020-25661](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25661) has been assigned and to track CVE-2020-12352, [CVE-2020-25662](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25662) has been assigned. These new Red Hat product specific CVEs only affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA kernel versions, kernel-4.18.0-240.el8 (and any kernel derived from this release such as kernel rt-4.18.0-240.rt7.54.el8).

To address CVE-2020-25661, CVE-2020-25662 and CVE-2020-24490, Red Hat is releasing so-called 0day (released on the same day or very close to that day) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel and kernel-rt errata that reintroduce (or address the newly introduced issue as is the case for CVE-2020-24490) fixes for these issues .

## Technical summary

These issues affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 in their default configurations when Bluetooth hardware is present and Bluetooth functionality is enabled on the system. An unauthenticated attacker in range to communicate over Bluetooth and with the knowledge of the system’s MAC (Media Access Control) address can exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges on the system as demonstrated by the researcher.

For Red Hat Atomic Host or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments, both virtual and physical hosts in a production environment should not have Bluetooth hardware present or enabled.

## Mitigation

To mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level, disable the Bluetooth functionality via blocklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Instructions on [how to disable Bluetooth modules](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931) are available on the Customer Portal.

Alternatively, Bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at BIOS level which will also provide an effective mitigation as the kernel will not be able to detect that Bluetooth hardware is present on the system.

## Remediation

Red Hat recommends all customers to update to new kernel packages as they become available.

## Technical details

### CVE-2020-12351

A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel’s Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol) packets with A2MP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) CID (Channel Identifier). This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or potentially executing arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

### CVE-2020-12352

An information leak flaw was found in the way Linux kernel’s Bluetooth stack implementation handled initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP (Alternate MAC-PHY Manager Protocol) packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

### CVE-2020-24490

A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel’s Bluetooth implementation processed extended advertising report events. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted Bluetooth packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

This issue is rated as having Moderate impact because the system needs to be actively scanning while the attacker is sending the advertisements in order to be exploited.

This issue does not impact any of Red Hat released products except for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA.

### CVE-2020-25661

A Red Hat only CVE-2020-12351 regression issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP packets with A2MP CID. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to crash the system, causing a denial of service or potentially executing arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.

This issue does not impact any of Red Hat released products except for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA.

### CVE-2020-25662

A Red Hat only CVE-2020-12352 regression issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled the initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP packets. This flaw allows a remote attacker in an adjacent range to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

This issue does not impact any of Red Hat released products except for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA.

## FAQ

**Q**: How can I check if my system has Bluetooth enabled?
**A**: We have provided Ansible playbook and detection scripts which can be used to detect if your system(s) have Bluetooth enabled. An alternative is using the lsmod command to confirm if the kernel has detected Bluetooth hardware and enabled the modules. Example output, searching for the presence of either bnep, btusb, or bluetooth kernel modules loaded is:

$ lsmod | egrep 'bnep|bluetooth|btusb'
   bnep                   23721  2
   btusb                  41449  0
   btrtl                  12945  1 btusb
   btbcm                  14040  1 btusb
   btintel                15709  1 btusb
   bluetooth             548688  49 bnep,btbcm,btrtl,btusb,rfcomm,btintel
   rfkill                 22391  8 cfg80211,thinkpad\_acpi,bluetooth
   $

**Q**: Do I need to reboot after applying mitigations?
**A**: Reboot is not required if you are able to remove the Bluetooth kernel modules from the running system. For more information refer to How to disable Bluetooth modules instructions that are available on the Customer Portal.

**Q**: How are containers impacted?
**A**: Bluetooth should not be enabled on container host environments. While this issue does not directly impact Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based containers, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends updating to the most recent images and latest version of container host-systems. To protect the integrity of the containers in use, customers will need to apply and deploy the updates to the container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Atomic Host).

### What is Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions?

Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions is a SAP specific offering, tailored to the needs of SAP workloads such as S/4HANA and SAP HANA platform. Furthermore, standardizing your SAP environment on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP Solutions helps streamline operations and reduce costs by providing integrated smart management and high availability solutions as part of the offering.

Customers also benefit from integrated customer support ticketing systems, enabling a single point of contact for support issues, streamlined resolution of incidents and continued collaboration for running SAP applications on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

With the integration of the ticketing systems, as well as our Technical Support Alliance Network (TSANet) membership Red Hat, SAP and certified hardware partners are able to more easily liaise on support issue resolutions, providing enhanced support services to customers.

All packages provided by **RHEL for SAP Applications** are also provided by **RHEL for SAP Solutions.**

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), the RHEL for SAP Solutions subscription offers the following additional components:

* SAP-specific technical components to support S/4HANA, SAP HANA, and SAP Business Applications.
* High Availability solutions for S/4HANA, SAP HANA, and SAP Business Applications.
* RHEL System Roles for SAP, which can be used to automate the configuration of a RHEL system to run SAP workloads.
* Smart Management and Red Hat Insights for lifecycle management and proactive optimization.
* Update Services and Extended Update Support:
  + Update Services for SAP Solutions provides support for specific minor RHEL releases for four years from General Availability.
  + Extended Update Support (EUS) for minor RHEL releases that do not have Update Services for SAP Solutions. EUS provides support for specific minor RHEL releases for two years from General Availability. See the [RHEL Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/) web page for more information on EUS and Update Services for SAP Solutions.

**Note:**

* Update Services for SAP Solutions is only provided with RHEL for SAP Solutions. It is not available on any other RHEL products.
* Update Services for SAP Solutions is only provided on specified minor RHEL releases, which may be different from the EUS releases.
* The RHEL for SAP Solutions subscription may be used with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, but it does not include Update Services for SAP Solutions. However, EUS is available on specific RHEL 6 releases, and it can be used under the RHEL for SAP Solutions subscription to allow for easier migration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c0)  Petr Matousek    2020-10-26 12:21:37 UTC  ``` This is a [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) regression that only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA kernel version kernel-4.18.0-240.el8 (and any kernel derived from this release such as kernel rt-4.18.0-240.rt7.54.el8).  [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) description follows:  A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP packets with A2MP CID. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to crash the system causing denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c1)  Petr Matousek    2020-10-26 12:21:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue only affects the Linux kernel version as shipped with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA release, kernel-4.18.0-240.el8 (and any kernel derived from this release such as kernel rt-4.18.0-240.rt7.54.el8). Red Hat was unable to include the fix for the original [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) issue in the GA release, as the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 GA release was in its final stages of release preparation when [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) was made public. All of the subsequent Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel versions, including the version included in the so-called 0day (released on the same day or very close to that day) erratum, contain the fix, thus immune to the original [CVE-2020-12351](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351) issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c2)  Petr Matousek    2020-10-26 12:21:48 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12351> <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/BleedingTooth>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c3)  Petr Matousek    2020-10-26 12:21:51 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  To mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level, disable the Bluetooth functionality via blocklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Instructions on how to disable Bluetooth modules are available on the Customer Portal at <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931>.  Alternatively, Bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at BIOS level which will also provide an effective mitigation as the kernel will not be able to detect that Bluetooth hardware is present on the system.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:27:16 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-25661>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-11-04 04:21:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:4686 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4686](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4686)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1891483#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-11-04 04:22:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:4685 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4685](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4685)   ``` |  |
