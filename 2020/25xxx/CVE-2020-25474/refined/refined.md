Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25474:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the software. This means that malicious scripts can be permanently stored on the server (e.g. in a database).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** If chained with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2020-25472), it can lead to account takeover.
- **Self-Stored XSS:** Without chaining, the impact is limited to a self-stored XSS, meaning the attacker can only execute the malicious script in their own browser, and it cannot be directly used to attack other users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious scripts into a field or input within the application, which is then stored by the software (likely in the database).
- When another user (or the attacker) views the page containing the stored script, it executes in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to input data into the application that is stored and later rendered in a way that allows the stored script to be executed.
- If attempting account takeover, chaining with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-25472) would be required, implying that the attacker can trigger a request on behalf of the victim user.
- For self-stored XSS, they only need to trigger the stored XSS in their own browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is "News Script PHP Pro" by SimplePhpScripts.
- The vulnerability is patched in the latest version of the software.
- The risk is rated as "High" for the Stored XSS because when chained with the CSRF, it leads to account takeover.
