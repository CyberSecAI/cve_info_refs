Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `device/port.inc.php` file. The application uses user-supplied input (`$vars['view']`) to include files, without proper sanitization or validation, and thus allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the `view` parameter in a GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files located on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the `$vars['view']` parameter, leading to the inclusion of unexpected files.
*   **Unrestricted File Access:** The code allows traversal out of the web root directory, which is a significant security concern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While the immediate impact is local file inclusion, the vulnerability can escalate to Remote Code Execution if the attacker can include a file containing malicious code (e.g. a PHP file with executable code).
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can include and view sensitive files from the server, potentially revealing configuration settings, credentials, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate the `view` parameter in the HTTP GET request to include arbitrary files by using directory traversal sequences like `../../`.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is located in `/var/opt/observium/html/pages/device/port.inc.php`:

```php
164 include($config['html_dir'] . '/pages/device/port/'.$vars['view'].'.inc.php');
```

The `$vars['view']` variable is taken directly from the HTTP GET parameter `view` without any filtering or sanitization. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences like `../../` to access any readable file on the server with `.inc.php` extension.

The provided example request demonstrates this:
```
GET /device/device=345/?tab=ports&view=../../../../includes/polling/wmi HTTP/1.1
```
This request includes the file `/var/opt/observium/includes/pooling/wmi.inc.php`, which is located outside the web root.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content highlights that the vulnerability affects multiple versions of the product (Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631), and also includes a link to a blog and OWASP page explaining the vulnerability type.
