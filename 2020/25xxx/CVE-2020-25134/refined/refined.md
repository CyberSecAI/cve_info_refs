{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows loading of arbitrary files with the `.inc.php` extension via the `format` parameter in the `settings` page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) could be achieved by including arbitrary `.inc.php` files from outside of the web root directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/settings/` with a manipulated `format` parameter, e.g., `?format=../../../includes/polling/wmi`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated user on the application."
