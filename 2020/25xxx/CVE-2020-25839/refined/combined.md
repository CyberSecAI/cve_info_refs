* [Section 3.2, Identity Reporting Issue](#t4dw295lcqc3)

### 3.1 Identity Applications Issue

You might encounter the following issue when you use Identity Applications, which includes Dashboard, Identity Applications Administration interface, and the User Application:

#### Settings to Enable and Disable Role to Role Approval Process is Not Working At Client Level

*Issue:*
In the settings page, if the approval process for role to role mapping is enabled for default client (client1) and disabled for other clients (say client2), the approval process is triggered for both client1 and client2 users when a child role is mapped to a parent role. (Defect OCTCR28Q289168)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. The enable and disable approval settings for role to role mapping must be configured for the default client, which will apply to all clients.

### 3.2 Identity Reporting Issue

You might encounter the following issue when you use Identity Reporting.

#### Data Generated in the Role Assignments of User Report is not Formatted Properly

*Issue:*
The Role Assignments of User Current State report displays the distinguished name (DN) of the group, approvers, and requester instead of their full names in the Source column. This is observed specifically for roles that are assigned to the user through role assignments to groups, containers, or through role to role mapping. (Defect OCTCR28Q287067)

*Workaround:*
There is no workaround at this time. However, there is no functionality loss. The fix for this issue will be available shortly.
