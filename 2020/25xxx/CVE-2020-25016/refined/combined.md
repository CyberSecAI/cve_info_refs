## Description

![@HeroicKatora](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5550310?u=38f33bbeb17c07d9f11cdc1dd465e4f0d62faac3&v=4&size=48)[HeroicKatora](https://github.com/HeroicKatora)opened [on Jun 14, 2020](https://github.com/kornelski/rust-rgb/issues/35#issue-638296079)

The trait assumes that an arbitrary type `T: Copy + 'static` can be viewed (and even modified!) as a byte slice. That is super unsound. Here's an example of causing UB with it:

```
let component: &'static str = "Hello, World!";
let mut not_rgb = [component; 3];
let bytes = FromSlice::as_rgb_mut(&mut not_rgb[..]).as_bytes_mut();
// Just write over this reference internals, lol.
bytes[0] += component.len() as u8;
// XXX: on most architectures this points after the original static now
// e.g. into some different static or executable memory
println!("{}", not_rgb[0]);
```

## Package

cargo

rgb
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.5.4, < 0.8.20

## Patched versions

0.8.20

## Description

Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any type T wrapped in RGB as bytes, and do not correctly constrain RGB and other wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.

Safety violation possible for a type wrapped in RGB and similar wrapper structures:

* If T contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized memory.
* If T contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing of arbitrary pointers.
* Any safety and/or validity invariants for T may be violated.

The issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB crate to implement an unsafe marker trait.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any type `T` wrapped in `RGB<T>` as bytes,
and do not correctly constrain `RGB<T>` and other wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.

Safety violation possible for a type wrapped in `RGB<T>` and similar wrapper structures:

* If `T` contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized memory.
* If `T` contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing of arbitrary pointers.
* Any safety and/or validity invariants for `T` may be violated.

The issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB crate to implement an unsafe marker trait.
