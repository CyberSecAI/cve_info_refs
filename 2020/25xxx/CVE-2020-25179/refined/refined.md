- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected GE Healthcare products may allow exposed or default credentials to be used to access or modify sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere. This is due to the presence of exposed/default credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain access to affected devices with privileges comparable to GE remote service users. This access could lead to the exposure of sensitive data (limited PHI), execution of arbitrary code, system unavailability, and manipulation of PHI.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to gain access to the healthcare delivery organization's (HDO) network to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable devices. The required skill level to exploit is low.
