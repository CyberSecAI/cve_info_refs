* Many other bug fixes as well.

### yEd 3.14 - Changes Since 3.13

#### New Features

* With the new **One-Click Layout service** getting a nice layout for your diagrams has become even easier:
  Just click the button in the toolbar and let this service analyze your diagram and choose an automatic layout algorithm for you that is then used to arrange your diagram. That's all!
  The service takes into account a diagram's structure as well as features like edge routing styles to base its decision on.
  (One-Click Layout is under ongoing development. With your feedback, we will constantly improve and update this service, independent of yEd releases.)
* The new series-parallel layout algorithm lends itself perfectly for a special group of diagrams that often arise in circuit diagrams and flowcharts.
* Added a new anonymization tool to remove any identifying information from a diagram.

#### Improvements

* Fixed a regression which affected, for example, the labels of a UML class node (stereotype, constraints, methods).

### yEd 3.6.1 - Changes Since 3.6

#### New Features

* New auto-rotation and auto-flipping support for edge labels. Edge labels can be configured to stay parallel to their corresponding edge segment, even in a dynamic scenario where the slope of the edge segment changes.
  Auto-flipping automatically flips the presentation of a label when it is upside-down, thus ensuring that users can understand the textual information in rotated labels.
* A new bus-style edge routing algorithm can be used to combine the edges in parts of a diagram where each node is connected to each other node. It produces edge paths that together form a concise, tree-like structure consisting of vertical and horizontal line segments.
* Local views, like, e.g., the Neighborhood view of a diagram, can be turned into documents of their own right. A new command in the context menu of local views enables this conversion.

* Addressed incorrect behavior of the Scope setting in the organic layout algorithm.
* Fixed application exception that could occur with damaged application settings files.
* Fixed an issue where image files that have been dragged into the active editor were not released by yEd, which prevented modifying/deleting such images in Windows Explorer.

### yEd 3.4 - Changes Since 3.3.0.2

#### New Features

* New comprehensive support for Swimlane diagrams has been added which comprises visual representation, user interaction, and support for automatic layout.
  Swimlane diagrams can be easily modeled using the new swimlane nodes from the palette which provide representations for rows and columns to which other nodes (group nodes also) can be added. Rows and columns can be interactively added, removed, resized, reordered, and also nested.
  The nodes from a Swimlane diagram can be automatically arranged by a new dedicated Swimlane layout algorithm.
* Four new tool windows, so-called context views, have been added that display specific information related to selected nodes or edges, including neighborhood, predecessors, successors, and the contents of folder nodes.
* A new tool has been added that can check whether a newer version of yEd is available for download from the yWorks website.
* New paste behavior allows to paste subgraphs directly into selected group nodes.
* Links to the yWorks home page and to the section with yEd-related articles in the yWorks Knowledge Base have been added to Help menu.
* Port constraints and edge groups are now persisted when the graph is saved to GraphML file format.

* Improved edge routing after closing and opening group nodes.
* The yEd Help has been updated.

#### Bugfixes

* Addressed a Mac OS X/Java 6 combo box selection problem where re-selecting the currently selected item from a list resulted in an application crash.
* Toggling between navigation mode and edit mode no longer resets the edit mode's configuration.
* Fixed problems with SVG nodes when printing in landscape orientation.

### yEd 3.3.0.2 - Changes Since 3.3.0.1

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed several undo-related issues, for example in conjunction with group node creation, and going into and out of group nodes.

#### Improvements

* JIDE version update.
* Reporting tool enhanced.

### yEd 3.3.0.1 - Changes Since 3.3

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed NPEs that could happen after the very first right mouse button release if the user is in Zoom To Area mode.
* Fixed NPE that happens if the user tries to change the application preferences while not in Edit Mode.
* Improved Report tool to not come up for expected exceptions (saving to read-only filesystems, malformed URLs, etc.)
* Fixed creation of self-loops with the Arc edge style leading to NPEs in orthogonal edge creation mode.
* Fixed exception that corrupted the graph structure that happened after undoing/redoing hierarchy operations.

#### Known Issues

* The Look and Feel for Mac OS X is broken for 64bit JDK 1.6 - switch to JDK 1.5 instead in the meantime.

### yEd 3.3 - Changes Since 3.2.0.1

#### New Features

* New support for so-called snap lines enables instant alignment of graph elements and makes editing a diagram easier than ever.
  When moving or resizing graph elements, the mouse snaps to suitable coordinates where other graph elements have their borders or centers and rests for an instant. Indicative lines are displayed to provide the user with an additional visual feedback.
  Node alignment functionality covers alignment of node centers and sides of nodes. Node resizing takes into account widths and heights of other nodes. Support for equidistant placement and placement according to preferred distances is provided for nodes and edges.
* New support for interactively creating and editing orthogonal edges.
  Edge creation yields an orthogonal edge path with alternating horizontal and vertical edge segments. Edge segments and bends can be easily moved while maintaining the orthogonal characteristic of an edge path.
* New distribution tools. Selected nodes can be distributed in horizontal or vertical direction so that they there is an equal distance between the graph elements.
* Visual feedback around nodes that indicate valid targets during edge creation and port relocation gestures.
* A new mechanism that allows for direct feedback has been added to yEd. In case of erroneous behavior, a comprehensive error report and additional comments can be sent to yWorks.

### yEd 3.2.0.1 - Changes Since 3.2

#### Improvements

* Simplified using the files produced by the HTML Flash Viewer export on a website.

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed file filter handling in Save and Export dialogs which sometimes produced exceptions like "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1."

### yEd 3.2 - Changes Since 3.1.2.1

#### New Features

* New export option "HTML Flash Viewer" that exports a graph to standard GraphML format together with a wrapping HTML page and a SWF file.
  The SWF file can be conveniently opened in a web browser by means of the HTML page. It contains an Adobe® Flash® Player-based viewer for displaying the GraphML file.
  Compared to the already existing export as a plain Flash file ("SWF Format"), the viewer adds several configurable features like an overview and zoom buttons.
* Added new "Current Elements" section to the Palette tool window that shows representatives of the current kinds of nodes and edges from the displayed graph. The representatives are dynamically updated when the graph changes.
  The criteria used to decide whether graph elements are considered equal are conveniently configurable.
* New "Editor" tab in the Preferences dialog that provides a variety of new configuration options for graph editing.
* Dragging an edge from the Palette tool window onto a node in the editor starts the creation of an edge of the corresponding type at the drop node.
* Dragging a node from the Palette tool window onto a group node adds the node to the group.

#### Improvements

* During a yEd session, the file format of the previous export is retained and preselected when the Export dialog is opened again.
* Diagram export to the TGF file format (Trivial Graph Format) has been reintroduced.
* Representations of large nodes in the palette were not properly centered.
* Added tooltips for entries in tabular views, i.e., entries in property tables and layout options/tool options that are docked.

#### Bugfixes

* Description and URL data for nodes or edges were ignored in the User Defined section of the Palette tool window. They are now properly handled.
* The yEd installer on Mac OS X no longer prompts for an administrator or root password.
* Application quit on Mac OS X can be canceled again.
* The overview is now properly updated with respect to selected graph elements on mode changes.
* It is no longer possible to apply a normal node's representation from a palette to a group node in the editor.
* Bends of edges inside folder nodes were displaced by Copy and Paste operations.
* A NullPointerException occurred when the Type combo box from the tabular properties view for a selected node or edge was opened followed by a click in the editor window.
* Multiline tooltips on the right side of an exported page had more line breaks than expected.
* The target editor window of a Drag and Drop operation from the palette did not gain focus, which prevented Paste operations using the keyboard shortcut (CTRL-V/Command-V on Mac OS X).

### yEd 3.1.2.1 - Changes Since 3.1.2

#### Improvements

* Problems during the setup for reusing an already running yEd application instance are handled more gracefully. If the setup fails, yEd starts up as in the pre-3.1.2 days.

### yEd 3.1.2 - Changes Since 3.1.1

#### New Features

* When opening graph files, there is no longer a new yEd application instance created for each single file. Instead, an already running instance is "reused."
* Added Mac-specific key bindings for menus, etc. Also, a new application icon has been added.

#### Bugfixes

* Added a workaround for a bug in Java 1.6.0\_10 which prevented checkboxes in yEd's property dialogs and property tables from working properly.
* Fixed a bug which occurred when edge grouping was used with multiple documents.

#### Improvements

* The yEd Windows installers (and uninstallers) no longer depend on the C runtime library file MSVCR71.dll to be accessible in the C:\Windows\System32 directory.

### yEd 3.1.1 - Changes Since 3.1

#### New Features

* Added panning support to the editor windows when in Edit Mode. Right-dragging the mouse (Command key-dragging on Mac OS X) moves the canvas.
* Label text optionally automatically adjusts to the width, the height, or both width and height of their nodes.
* Support for importing image files and SVG files via drag and drop gesture. Image files and SVG files can be dragged to the section for user-defined graph elements in the Palette tool window.
  Also, when dragged directly to the active editor window, a new image node is created at the drop location.
* The Palette tool window supports clearing all user-defined graph elements at once.

#### Bugfixes

* Corrected scroll bar behavior with regard to undo, area zoom, and navigating folder nodes (closed group nodes).
* Corrected language switching for node label options.
* Fixed incorrect behavior where multiple property dialogs could be opened.
* Corrected visual feedback for cut/copy/paste icons in the tool bar.
* Fixed inconsistent behavior when deleting nodes in group nodes.
* Addressed issue with node label placement where sometimes settings from the property dialog were not adhered to.

### yEd 3.1 - Changes Since 3.0.1.1

#### New Features

* Added new layout algorithm for genealogical family trees.
* yEd supports importing files in GEDCOM file format, the most common format for encoding genealogical data.
* New full-screen mode for browsing graphs.
* New palette that makes available "Modern"-style node representations.
* Labels can be selected just like other graph elements.
* Group nodes offer a new option to take into account their label's size for minimum size calculation. Effectively, this means that they will never get smaller than their label.

#### Improvements

* Help pages that explain a layout algorithm and its options can be opened directly from the algorithm's settings dialog.
* Loading graphs from URL now also supports non-GraphML file formats like, e.g., GML or YGF.
* Mouse wheel zooming considers the current position of the mouse.
* A warning dialog is presented before resetting to the factory defaults in any of the settings dialogs.
* Removed "Powered by yFiles" watermarking from the editor windows and from exported documents.

* Damaged history files ('history.xml' in the '.yed3' profile directory) are ignored at startup, there is no longer an exception thrown.

#### Improvements

* Larger initial size for the multi-line text fields in popup windows (used for editing node label and edge label text and also additional descriptions).

### yEd 3.0.0.7 - Changes Since 3.0.0.6

#### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug that occurred when searching for edges using CTRL-F.
* Changing a property for a selection of multiple graph elements sometimes failed (e.g. setting the color of differently colored nodes to black). This has been fixed.
* When leaving a folder node that is at the top-level, i.e., returning to the view of the root graph, the '(Back to the) Previous View' button in the tool bar is now properly disabled.

#### Improvements

* Improved startup time for the JNLP version with Java 1.6.
* Leaving a group node, i.e., returning to the view of the hierarchy level above, now centers the view so that the group node is in the middle of the canvas.
* yEd is more lenient when parsing GraphML files.
* Hot keys for switching to navigation mode or edit mode (CTRL-SHIFT-S and CTRL-SHIFT-D, respectively).
* Mac OS X support for the 'Go to URL' function has been improved.

### yEd 3.0.0.6 - Changes Since 3.0.0.5

* Setting the color value that is used to identify directed edges for Directed Orthogonal Layout to 'no color' no longer corrupts the layout algorithm's setup.
* Copy/Paste and Undo/Redo correctly handle additional data for nodes and edges, i.e., URLs and descriptions.

#### Improvements

* The color of the resize knobs at selected nodes has been set to dark gray.
* Dialogs for both layout algorithms and tools that were closed when in 'docked' state are opened standalone again the next time.
* In the 'Save As...' and 'Export...' file choosers the base name of the current graph is used as a suggestion for the file name.
* Re-enabled the GML graph exchange file format for diagram export.
* Settings that were modified in a standalone dialog for either layout algorithm or tool are kept when switching the dialog to 'docked' state.

### yEd 3.0.0.3 - Changes Since 3.0.0.2
