# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : libvncserver
Version        : 0.9.11+dfsg-1.3+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-25708 CVE-2020-29260

```
Two issues have been found in libvncserver, a library to write one's own
VNC server.
```

CVE-2020-25708

    Due to some missing checks, a divide by zero could happen, which could
    result in a denial of service.

CVE-2020-29260

    Due to a memory leak in function rfbClientCleanup() a remote attacker
    might be able to cause a denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.9.11+dfsg-1.3+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.

For the detailed security status of libvncserver please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libvncserver>
