Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-25708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a divide-by-zero error within the `rfbSendRectEncodingRaw` function in the `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` file. This occurs due to missing checks that would prevent the division by zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Divide-by-zero vulnerability in the `rfbSendRectEncodingRaw` function.
- The lack of input validation allows for a specially crafted message to trigger the divide by zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS). The divide-by-zero error causes a floating-point exception, which crashes the VNC server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious client can send a specially crafted message to the vulnerable VNC server to trigger the divide-by-zero condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable VNC server as a client and send malicious messages.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `libvncserver-0.9.12`.
- The fix is included in `libvncserver 0.9.13`.
- Red Hat mentions that a firewall flagged TurboVNC connections, however, they stated that LibVNCServer is the only vulnerable codebase.
- The issue was fixed in Debian version 0.9.11+dfsg-1.3+deb10u5 for Debian 10 buster.
