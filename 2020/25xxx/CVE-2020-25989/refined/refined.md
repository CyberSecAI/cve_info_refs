Based on the provided commit diff, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the code first removes a file using `os.Remove(pth)` and then attempts to write to it using `ioutil.WriteFile`. This is done in multiple functions including `write`, `writeUp`, `writeDown`, `writeBlock`, `writeAuth`, `writeConfWgLinux`, `writeConfWgQuick` and `PidInit`.

- **Root cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the unnecessary removal of the file before writing to it. This introduces a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **TOCTOU Race Condition:** An attacker can potentially exploit the time gap between the file removal and the file write to create a symlink or another file at the same path, thereby causing the program to write to a location it didn't intend to.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system with attacker-controlled content by exploiting the race condition. This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service, or other malicious outcomes depending on the specific context and what files are targeted.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attacker would need to be able to create a symlink or another file at the path where the application intends to create and write a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker would need local access to the system and the ability to manipulate files and directories to win the race condition.

The commit diff shows that the fix was to add the `os.Remove` call before the `ioutil.WriteFile` call.
