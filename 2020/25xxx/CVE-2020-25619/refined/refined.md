Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-25619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The N-Central backend utilizes SSH port forwarding to allow connections between agents and authorized users, enabling access to the agent machine. While the SSH connection is designed to be restricted to port forwarding only, and not command execution on the backend, it is possible to create port forwardings for localhost (127.0.0.1). This allows bypassing of the local firewall of the N-Central backend server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Localhost Port Forwarding:** The SSH port forwarding mechanism does not properly restrict the destination of the forwarding, allowing for connections to localhost (127.0.0.1).
*   **Firewall Bypass:** The ability to forward ports to localhost allows attackers to bypass the local firewall of the N-Central backend server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Internal Services:** By creating port forwardings to localhost, an attacker can access internal services of the backend server, which are normally protected by the local firewall.
*   **Database Access:** One of the internal services accessible is the local Postgres database which does not require authentication (CVE-2020-25621). This database contains sensitive data, including private keys, MD5 password hashes, and plaintext passwords.
*   **Compromised Backend:** Accessing the database can lead to a compromised backend, potentially affecting the whole network managed by SolarWinds N-Central.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSH Port Forwarding Abuse:** An attacker exploits the SSH port forwarding mechanism to forward a port to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on the N-Central backend server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to an Agent or N-Central User:** The attacker needs to have access to either an agent machine managed by N-Central, or an authorized user account. This allows the attacker to create the necessary SSH connection and port forwarding.

In summary, CVE-2020-25619 describes a vulnerability where an attacker, with access to either a managed agent or user account, can leverage the SSH port forwarding feature in SolarWinds N-Central to bypass the local firewall and access internal services, including an unauthenticated database containing sensitive data, potentially leading to a full compromise of the backend server.
