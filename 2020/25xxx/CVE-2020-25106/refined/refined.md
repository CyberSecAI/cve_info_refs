Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Supremo File Manager, which, when the application runs as a service, allows users to modify files with SYSTEM privileges. This occurs because the file operations performed through the File Manager inherit the SYSTEM context of the service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is a local privilege escalation.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** The File Manager, while running as SYSTEM, does not restrict file modification operations based on user privileges.
- **Insecure Service Context:** The service context of the application is not properly isolated from user file operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local System Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker SYSTEM level access on the target machine.
- **Malware Execution:** Attackers can replace the legitimate Supremo executable with a malicious one, which will then be executed with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can use the elevated privileges to perform various malicious activities, including installing malware, accessing sensitive data, and modifying system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker gains access to the target machine through Supremo's remote control functionality.
- **File Manager Usage:**  The attacker uses the file manager to navigate to the directory containing the Supremo executable.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker renames the original Supremo executable and uploads a malicious one, renaming the malicious file to the original executable's name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Connection:** The attacker needs to establish a remote connection to the target machine through Supremo.
- **Supremo Service Running:** Supremo must be running as a service on the target machine for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- **File Manager Access:** The attacker needs the ability to use the File Manager feature within the Supremo application.
- **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker needs to have a malicious executable ready to be uploaded to the target machine.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in Supremo version 4.1.3.2348 and older.
- The vendor released a fix in version 4.2.0.2423.
- The advisory was released on 2020-12-21.
