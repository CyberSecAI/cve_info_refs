We don't have to sift through data to find what we're looking for, with Cybereason our team can just focus on what's important, mitigate and isolate on the fly, and even automate those processes.

Richard Rushing
CISO
Motorola Mobility

I love Cybereason because it works. We believe that they're the leader in the industry in relation to our current posture.

Chaim Mazal
VP & Head of Information Security
ActiveCampaign

We are very satisfied with the Cybereason product, it's the best protection we're getting, and keeps us out of the news, which is the important part for us.
