Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25502:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue present in some versions of the Cybereason Defense Platform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DLL Hijacking: The platform was susceptible to loading a malicious DLL, potentially due to insecure search paths or lack of proper DLL verification. This could occur if a lower-privileged process attempts to load a legitimate DLL but instead loads a malicious one placed in a higher-priority location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Gaining additional control over vulnerable endpoints:** A successful exploit would allow a lower-privileged user or process to gain elevated privileges or additional control over the system by executing malicious code through the hijacked DLL.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious DLL placement:** An attacker could place a malicious DLL in a location where it will be loaded instead of a legitimate one when the Cybereason Defense Platform attempts to load it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Lower privileged user or process access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute a lower-privileged process on the target system or have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a specific location on the system.
- No mention of network access, meaning that the attacker's primary focus would be to place the malicious DLL locally.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Lockheed Martin Red Team and validated by the Cybereason Security Team.
- The issue has been fixed in specific versions of the Cybereason Defense Platform:
    - 19.1.282 and above
    - 19.2.182 and above
    - 20.1.343 and above
    - 20.2.X and above
