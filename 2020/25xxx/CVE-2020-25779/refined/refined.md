- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) homograph attack, using Punycode, could be used to bypass the web threat protection feature in Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac 2020 (Consumer).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software improperly handles IDNs allowing an attacker to use homoglyphs to create a malicious website that appears legitimate to the software. This allowed the attacker to add the malicious website to the approved website list, bypassing web threat protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass web threat protection by adding a malicious website to the approved list. This could potentially lead to further malware infection, phishing attacks, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the use of an Internationalized Domain Name homograph attack using Punycode. An attacker crafts a malicious website using homoglyphs to appear legitimate, which is then added to the approved list, bypassing web threat protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious website using Punycode to exploit the IDN homograph vulnerability. The attacker needs to trick the Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac software to add their crafted domain to the allowed list.
