Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-25696:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `\gset` meta-command in the `psql` interactive terminal. This command, used for setting `psql` variables based on query results, fails to distinguish between regular variables and those that control `psql`'s behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unrestricted Variable Overwriting:** The core weakness is that `\gset` allows overwriting special `psql` variables, which can control the program's execution and functionality, with values provided by a query result.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A compromised or malicious server, when queried via `psql` using `\gset`, can inject malicious commands or settings into `psql` variables, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the user's operating system, with the privileges of the user running `psql`. This means an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised Server:** An attacker needs to control a PostgreSQL server to be able to inject malicious data through queries.
- **Interactive psql Session:** The victim must use the `psql` client and use `\gset` to fetch data from the compromised server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to control a PostgreSQL server.
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious data through queries, that will be consumed by a vulnerable `psql` client.
- The victim must be using the `psql` client interactively and using the `\gset` meta-command.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in PostgreSQL versions 9.5 through 13.
- A mitigation is to use `\gset` with a prefix that is not recognized as a special `psql` variable e.g. using lowercase prefix.
- The upstream fix restricts the variables that `\gset` can modify.
