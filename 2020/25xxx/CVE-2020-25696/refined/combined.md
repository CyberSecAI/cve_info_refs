CVE ID         : CVE-2020-25694 CVE-2020-25695 CVE-2020-25696

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the PostgreSQL database system.

CVE-2020-25694

    Peter Eisentraut found that database reconnections may drop options
    from the original connection, such as encryption, which could lead
    to information disclosure or a man-in-the-middle attack.

CVE-2020-25695

    Etienne Stalmans reported that a user with permissions to create
    non-temporary objects in an schema can execute arbitrary SQL
    functions as a superuser.

CVE-2020-25696

    Nick Cleaton found that the \gset command modified variables that
    control the psql behaviour, which could result in a compromised or
    malicious server executing arbitrary code in the user session.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
9.6.20-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.6 packages.

# PostgreSQL 13.1, 12.5, 11.10, 10.15, 9.6.20, and 9.5.24 Released!

Posted on **2020-11-12** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 PostgreSQL Project
 Security

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of our database system, including 13.1, 12.5, 11.10, 10.15, 9.6.20, and
9.5.24. This release closes three security vulnerabilities and fixes over 65
bugs reported over the last three months.

Due to the nature of CVE-2020-25695, we advise you to [update as soon as possible](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

Additionally, this is the second-to-last release of PostgreSQL 9.5. If you are
running PostgreSQL 9.5 in a production environment, we suggest that you make
plans to upgrade.

For the full list of changes, please review the
[release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release.html).

## Security Issues

### CVE-2020-25695: Multiple features escape "security restricted operation" sandbox

Versions Affected: 9.5 - 13. The security team typically does not test
unsupported versions, but this problem is quite old.

An attacker having permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one
schema can execute arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a superuser.

While promptly updating PostgreSQL is the best remediation for most users, a
user unable to do that can work around the vulnerability by disabling
autovacuum and not manually running `ANALYZE`, `CLUSTER`, `REINDEX`,
`CREATE INDEX`, `VACUUM FULL`, `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, or a restore from
output of the `pg_dump` command. Performance may degrade quickly under this
workaround.

`VACUUM` without the `FULL` option is safe, and all commands are fine when a
trusted user owns the target object.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Etienne Stalmans for reporting this problem.

### CVE-2020-25694: Reconnection can downgrade connection security settings

Versions Affected: 9.5 - 13. The security team typically does not test
unsupported versions, but this problem is quite old.

Many PostgreSQL-provided client applications have options that create additional
database connections. Some of those applications reuse only the basic
connection parameters (e.g. `host`, `user`, `port`), dropping others. If this
drops a security-relevant parameter (e.g. `channel_binding`, `sslmode`,
`requirepeer`, `gssencmode`), the attacker has an opportunity to complete a MITM
attack or observe cleartext transmission.

Affected applications are `clusterdb`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql`,
`reindexdb`, and `vacuumdb`. The vulnerability arises only if one invokes an
affected client application with a connection string containing a
security-relevant parameter.

This also fixes how the `\connect` command of `psql` reuses connection
parameters, i.e. all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection
string now re-used.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Peter Eisentraut for reporting this problem.

### CVE-2020-25696: `psql`'s `\gset` allows overwriting specially treated variables

Versions Affected: 9.5 - 13. The security team typically does not test
unsupported versions, but this problem likely arrived with the feature's debut
in version 9.3.

The `\gset` meta-command, which sets `psql` variables based on query results,
does not distinguish variables that control `psql` behavior. If an interactive
`psql` session uses `\gset` when querying a compromised server, the attacker can
execute arbitrary code as the operating system account running `psql`.
Using `\gset` with a prefix not found among specially treated variables, e.g.
any lowercase string, precludes the attack in an unpatched `psql`.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Nick Cleaton for reporting this problem.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

This update also fixes over 65 bugs that were reported in the last several
months. Some of these issues only affect version 13, but may also apply to other
supported versions.

Some of these fixes include:

* Fix a breakage in the replication protocol by ensuring that two "command
  completion" events are expected for `START_REPLICATION`.
* Ensure `fsync` is called on the SLRU caches that PostgreSQL maintains. This
  prevents potential data loss due to an operating system crash.
* Fix `ALTER ROLE` usage for users with the `BYPASSRLS` permission.
* `ALTER TABLE ONLY ... DROP EXPRESSION` is disallowed on partitioned tables
  when there are child tables.
* Ensure that `ALTER TABLE ONLY ... ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER` does not apply to
  child tables.
* Fix for `ALTER TABLE ... SET NOT NULL` on partitioned tables to avoid a
  potential deadlock in parallel `pg_restore`.
* Fix handling of expressions in `CREATE TABLE LIKE` with inheritance.
* `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is disallowed on partitioned tables.
* Allow `LOCK TABLE` to succeed on a self-referential view instead of throwing
  an error.
* Several fixes around statistics collection and progress reporting for
  `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
* Ensure that `GENERATED` columns are updated when any columns they depend on
  are updated via a rule or an updatable view.
* Support hash partitioning with text array columns as partition keys.
* Allow the jsonpath `.datetime()` method to accept ISO 8601-format timestamps.
* During a "smart" shutdown, ensure background processes are not terminated
  until all foreground client sessions are completed, fixing an issue that broke
  the processing of parallel queries.
* Several fixes for the query planner and optimizer.
* Ensure that data is de-toasted before being inserted into a BRIN index. This
  could manifest itself with errors like "missing chunk number 0 for toast value
  NNN". If you have seen a similar error in an existing BRIN index, you should be
  able to correct it by using `REINDEX` on the index.
* Fix the output of `EXPLAIN` to have the correct XML tag nesting for
  incremental sort plans.
* Several fixes for memory leaks, including ones involving RLS policies, using
  `CALL` with PL/pgSQL, `SIGHUP` processing a configuration parameter that cannot
  be applied without a restart, and an edge-case for index lookup for a partition.
* libpq can now support arbitrary-length lines in the .pgpass file.
* On Windows, `psql` now reads the output of a backtick command in text mode,
  not binary mode, so it can now properly handle newlines.
* Fix how `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `clusterdb`, `reindexdb`, and `vacuumdb` use
  complex connection-string parameters.
* When the `\connect` command of `psql` reuses connection parameters, ensure
  that all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection string are also
  re-used.
* Ensure that `pg_dump` collects per-column information about extension
  configuration tables, avoiding crashes when specifying `--inserts`.
* Ensure that parallel `pg_restore` processes foreign keys referencing
  partitioned tables in the correct order.
* Several fixes for `contrib/pgcrypto`, including a memory leak fix.

This update also contains tzdata release 2020d for for DST law changes in Fiji,
Morocco, Palestine, the Canadian Yukon, Macquarie Island, and Casey Station
(Antarctica); plus historical corrections for France, Hungary, Monaco, and
Palestine.

For the full list of changes available, please review the
[release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release.html).

## PostgreSQL 9.5 EOL Notice

[versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) for more
information.

## Updating

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use `pg_upgrade` in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.

Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional,
post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for
details.

For more details, please see the
[release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/release.html).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-04 09:20:15 UTC  ``` The \gset meta-command, which sets psql variables based on query results, does not distinguish variables that control psql behavior.  If an interactive psql session uses \gset when querying a compromised server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code as the operating system account running psql.  Using \gset with a prefix not found among specially treated variables, e.g. any lowercase string, precludes the attack in an unpatched psql.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-11-04 09:20:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Nick Cleaton   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c8)  msiddiqu    2020-11-12 15:19:29 UTC  ``` Created mingw-postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897233](show_bug.cgi?id=1897233 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25696 mingw-postgresql: postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897230](show_bug.cgi?id=1897230 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25696 postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:10/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897227](show_bug.cgi?id=1897227 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25696 postgresql:10/postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:11/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897224](show_bug.cgi?id=1897224 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25696 postgresql:11/postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:12/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897221](show_bug.cgi?id=1897221 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-25696 postgresql:12/postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   Created postgresql:9.6/postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1897218](show_bug.cgi?id=1897218 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-25696 postgresql:9.6/postgresql: psql's \gset allows overwriting specially treated variables [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c11)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-11-17 08:17:47 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-131-125-1110-1015-9620-and-9524-released-2111/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c12)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-11-17 08:48:04 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Using \gset with a prefix not found among specially treated variables, e.g. any lowercase string, precludes the attack in an unpatched psql.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c13)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-11-17 09:14:23 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=098fb00799ffb026ff12c64bd21635f963cfc609>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-02 10:36:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2020:5316 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5316](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5316)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-12-02 10:39:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS  Via RHSA-2020:5317 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5317](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5317)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1894430#c18)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-12-02 17:33:57 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
