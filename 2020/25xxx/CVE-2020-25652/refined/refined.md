  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-25652",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the spice-vdagentd daemon, where it did not properly handle client connections that can be established via the UNIX domain socket in `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`. Any unprivileged local guest user could use this flaw to prevent legitimate agents from connecting to the spice-vdagentd daemon, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `spice-vdagentd` daemon does not limit the number of client connections accepted through the UNIX domain socket at `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`. Additionally, existing connections do not have timeouts or other preconditions to remain alive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of limit on the number of client connections.",
      "No timeouts or preconditions for existing connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged local user within the VM can open numerous connections to `spice-vdagentd`, exhausting the daemon's file descriptor limit. This prevents legitimate `spice-vdagent` instances from connecting, disrupting SPICE features and potentially causing a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local, unprivileged user in the VM opens multiple connections to the `spice-vdagentd` daemon via the UNIX domain socket.",
       "A local user exhausts file descriptors in `spice-vdagentd` preventing new connections."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged local user in the guest VM with access to the UNIX domain socket at `/run/spice-vdagentd/spice-vdagent-sock`."
