Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-25834:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the ArcSight Logger when parsing Syslog messages. Specifically, the Logger does not sanitize HTML tags within the syslog message, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious HTML/JavaScript code injected via a Syslog message is stored and then executed within the context of the ArcSight Logger's web interface when the log entry is viewed.
-   **Insecure Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**  The CSP of ArcSight Logger allows 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' which permits the execution of inline JavaScript, contributing to the exploitability of XSS.
-   **Lack of HttpOnly Flag:** The 'session\_string' cookie, which is used for authenticated sessions, lacks the HttpOnly flag. This allows an attacker with XSS to steal the user's session cookie.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Cookie Stealing:** The primary impact is the ability to steal user session cookies via XSS.
-   **Account Hijacking:** With stolen cookies, an attacker could potentially hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access to the ArcSight Logger application.
-   **Data Manipulation/Theft:** By executing arbitrary JavaScript, an attacker could perform various malicious actions such as manipulating data within the application or potentially exfiltrating sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Syslog Injection:** The attack vector is through the Syslog protocol. An attacker can send a specially crafted Syslog message containing malicious code to the ArcSight Connector, which forwards the message to the ArcSight Logger.
-   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the ArcSight Logger to send Syslog messages to the ArcSight Connector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ArcSight Connector to send Syslog messages.
-   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of syslog protocol and ability to send syslog messages.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was found and reported by Cyber Eagle in collaboration with WBSec.
-   The issue affects ArcSight Logger.
-   The vulnerability was remediated in ArcSight Logger version 7.1.1.
-   The attacker injects a malicious image tag within a syslog message that triggers an onerror event, executing arbitrary javascript to steal session cookies.
-   Attempts to exploit XSS in ArcSight Logger's classic search and ArcSight Management Center were unsuccessful due to input filtering.
