Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Summary:**
The commit message "remove sensitive info of guest sending to host" and the code changes in `federatedml/tree/hetero/hetero_decision_tree_guest.py` indicate a vulnerability where sensitive information (weights, gradients, and Hessians) was being sent from the guest to the host in a federated learning setting. The commit introduces a function `remove_sensitive_info` to remove this information before transmitting the tree.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper transmission of sensitive information during the federated learning process. Specifically, the weights, gradients (sum_grad), and Hessians (sum_hess) of tree nodes were sent from the guest to the host without being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. The host should not have access to the guest's model's internal parameters (weights, gradients, Hessians). This would violate privacy and could potentially lead to model inversion attacks where the host could infer information about the guest's data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Privacy Violation:** The host can learn sensitive information about the guest's data through the exposed model parameters.
-   **Model Inversion:** An attacker (the host) could potentially use the leaked parameters to reconstruct or infer aspects of the guest's training data.
-   **Compromised Federated Learning:** The fundamental principles of federated learning rely on keeping each party's data private, which is violated in this instance.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Malicious Host:** A malicious host could exploit this by receiving and analyzing the sensitive information of the guest.
-   **Compromised Host:** If the host is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain access to the sensitive information that was sent by the guest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Position:** The attacker needs to be the host in the federated learning setup.
-   **Capabilities:** The attacker would not require any specific technical capabilities beyond the ability to receive and interpret the data sent by the guest.

**Technical Details:**
The relevant code changes are in the `federatedml/tree/hetero/hetero_decision_tree_guest.py` file:
-   A new function `remove_sensitive_info` is added to clear the sensitive information (`weight`, `sum_grad`, `sum_hess`) from the tree nodes before sending it to the host:

```python
    def remove_sensitive_info(self):
        """
        host is not allowed to get weights/g/h
        """
        new_tree_ = copy.deepcopy(self.tree_)
        for node in new_tree_:
            node.weight = None
            node.sum_grad = None
            node.sum_hess = None

        return new_tree_
```
- The `sync_tree` method now calls the `remove_sensitive_info` method to sanitize the tree before sending it to the host.

```python
    def sync_tree(self):
        LOGGER.info("sync tree to host")

        self.transfer_inst.tree.remote(self.tree_,
        tree_nodes = self.remove_sensitive_info()
        self.transfer_inst.tree.remote(tree_nodes,
                                      role=consts.HOST,
                                      idx=-1)
```

This commit fixes the vulnerability by preventing sensitive data from being exposed to the host during federated learning.
