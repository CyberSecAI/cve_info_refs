  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2020-25853": {
      "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the CheckMIC() function during the processing of EAPOL frames.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The CheckMIC() function reads an unsigned short from the EAP packet, specifically the 802.1X Authentication's Length field, and stores it in &tmpbuf[16]. This value, `v8__len`, is later used as a size parameter to `_rt_md5_hmac_veneer()` or `_rt_hmac_sha1_veneer()`." ,
        "These functions will read outside of the `tmpbuf` bounds if `v8__len` is sufficiently large, leading to an out-of-bounds read. The size of tmpbuf is fixed at 512 bytes."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service. The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash or other unexpected behavior, disrupting the functionality of the device.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted EAPOL frame with a manipulated length field during the WPA2 handshake.",
          "The attacker does not need to know the network's Pre-Shared Key (PSK)."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker in the vicinity of an affected Wi-Fi module can send the crafted EAPOL packets."
