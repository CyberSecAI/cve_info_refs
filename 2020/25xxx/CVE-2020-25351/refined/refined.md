Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig version 3.9.5. However, without the official CVE description, it is difficult to confirm that the described vulnerabilities relate to **CVE-2020-25351** specifically. 

**Vulnerabilities Detailed:**

The content describes the following vulnerabilities in rConfig 3.9.5:

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/lib/crud/configcompare.crud.php` script discloses the content of a file specified via the `path_a` parameter when comparing it to another file (`path_b`) and they are different.
    *   **Weakness:** Uncontrolled path in `path_a` parameter allows arbitrary file access.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive file disclosure (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script with a path to the file that attacker wants to read in `path_a` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php` script allows deleting files based on `path` and `ext` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation on `path` and `ext` parameters allows deletion of arbitrary files.
    *   **Impact:** Deletion of system or application files, potentially leading to denial of service or system instability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with the target file's path using `path` parameter and extension via `ext` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

3.  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeviceStatus.php` script opens connections to specified hosts and ports via `deviceIpAddr` and `connPort` parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation on `deviceIpAddr` and `connPort` parameters allows making requests to arbitrary hosts and ports.
    *   **Impact:** Internal port scanning, access to internal resources, or potentially exploitation of other services within the network.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script with a target IP address and port.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

4.  **Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when adding devices, commands, and snippets in the application.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding of user-supplied data leading to reflected XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Inserting malicious JavaScript payloads (e.g., `<svg onload=alert(1)>`) into the `Model`, `Command`, and `Snippet` fields. The payloads are executed when the content is rendered on a different page within the application.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to access the application's administrative interface to add or edit devices, commands and snippets.

5.  **Privilege Escalation (via `sudo zip` and `sudo crontab`):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The user has permission to execute `sudo zip` and `sudo crontab`.
    *   **Weakness:**  Uncontrolled use of these programs by the user can allow for executing arbitrary commands with root permissions.
    *   **Impact:** The user can obtain root privileges.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Using `sudo zip` to execute shell commands or using `sudo crontab` to execute commands.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** User needs to have sudo permissions for `zip` and `crontab`

6.  **Arbitrary File Read via tail:**
    *   **Root Cause:** After privilege escalation, `tail` can be used to read any file on the filesystem.
    *   **Weakness:**  `tail` can be used to read any privileged file.
    *   **Impact:** The user can obtain root privileges.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Using `tail` to read a file.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The user needs to have sudo permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post indicates that the identified issues were found during a security review of rConfig version 3.9.5.
*   The post does not provide details on how the XSS vulnerabilities are handled by the application.

Given the description, it is likely that the vulnerabilities described are related to CVE-2020-25351 but without an official description for the CVE, this cannot be confirmed.
