CVSSv3.1 Score
-------------------------------------------------
AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Vendor
-------------------------------------------------
Hyland Software - (<https://www.hyland.com/en/> and <https://www.onbase.com/en/>)

Product
-------------------------------------------------
Hyland OnBase
All derivatives based on OnBase

Versions Affected
-------------------------------------------------
All versions up to and prior to OnBase Foundation EP1 (tested: 19.8.9.1000) and OnBase 18 (tested: 18.0.0.32). OnBase
Foundation EP2 and OnBase Foundation EP3 were not available to test, but Hyland's response indicates that they are not
likely to have fixed the vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Summary
-------------------------------------------------
Because Hyland OnBase largely relies on client-side validation, the server-side contains a number of critical XXE
injection flaws, allowing remote attackers read and write arbitrary files, as well as run arbitrary commands on the
OnBase server. All versions of OnBase were found to be equally vulnerable.

Technical Details
-------------------------------------------------
OnBase server allows XXE injection in multiple methods that accept and parse user-provided XML.

Solution
-------------------------------------------------
Multiple methods within OnBase server accept XML-based input, like for managing and creating users and patients,
creating and editing charts and documents, and editing and creating records. Several of these methods were found to
allow XXE injection because they fail to ignore the DTD specification, allowing attackers to read and write arbitrary
files on the server and run arbitrary commands. Additional methods were found in other parts of the application,
especially those tied to server configuration. All instances found required the user to be authenticated, but any
authenticated user could call the methods.

Timeline
-------------------------------------------------
07 May 2019 - Adaptive Security Consulting discovered a series of vulnerabilities in medical records management and
search applications being considered by our client
15 May 2019 - The client was provided with the results of the assessment, including POCs for a number of high and
critical vulnerabilities
12 July 2019 - Client asked for more information and demonstrations
01 October 2019 - Client asked to test latest version of Hyland software
15 October 2019 - Client was informed that EP1 contained many of the same vulnerabilities
March 2020 - Client contacted Hyland and spoke with the Director of Application Security who said that fixing
vulnerabilities was "writing custom code" and that Hyland "doesn't write custom code"
21 April 2020 - Adaptive Security Consulting attempted to contact Hyland's Application Security Team via email on
behalf of client, but attempts were ignored
