The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Qualcomm's QCMAP software, and one of them is indeed CVE-2020-25858.

**CVE-2020-25858 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the `Tokenizer` function of the `QCMAP_Web_CLIENT` binary. This occurs because the return value of `strstr` (or `strchr` in some implementations), which is used to locate the `=` character in an input string, is not checked for NULL before being dereferenced. If the `=` character is absent, `strstr` returns `NULL` leading to a crash.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of NULL return values from string manipulation functions (`strstr` or `strchr`).
*   **Impact:**  A successful exploit of this vulnerability causes the `QCMAP_Web_CLIENT` process to crash. This can lead to denial-of-service. While the document doesn't explicitly state it, the context indicates that other vulnerabilities could be chained to this to obtain code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web server, specifically to the `cgi-bin/qcmap_web_cgi` endpoint, which lacks the "=" character in its parameters, triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web server, which could be achievable over a local network or remotely if the webserver is exposed.
