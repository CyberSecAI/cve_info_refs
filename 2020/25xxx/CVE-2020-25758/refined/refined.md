Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-25758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The D-Link routers use a plain text configuration file, which can be modified by an attacker to inject arbitrary cron entries. The device's configuration upload mechanism only checks for a valid CRC, which is trivial for a malicious user to bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper input validation on the router configuration file.
- Insufficient validation during configuration file uploads, relying on easily modified checksums.
- Plain text configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary cron entries, which will execute commands as root.
- Complete control of the router, and therefore the potential to intercept, modify traffic, cause denial of service, and launch further attacks on connected devices/networks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious router configuration file.
- The malicious configuration is uploaded through the router's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated on the router's web interface.
- The attacker must have access to the web interface either on LAN or WAN.

**Additional Notes**
- The vendor (D-Link) did not consider this issue a high priority, classifying it as low threat, due to the fact that other vulnerabilities which would give the attacker access to the router would need to be exploited first. They did not fix this in the affected products.
- The affected devices are DSR-150, DSR-150N, DSR-250, DSR-250N, DSR-500 Rev. B, DSR-500AC, DSR-1000 Rev. B, DSR-1000AC
- The vulnerability affects firmware versions 3.17 and older.
