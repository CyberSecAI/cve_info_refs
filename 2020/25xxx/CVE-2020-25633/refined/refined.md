Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in how the RESTEasy client handles `WebApplicationException` responses from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** The RESTEasy client, in versions up to 4.5.6.Final, may expose sensitive information from the server when a `WebApplicationException` is received.
- The potentially leaked information includes headers, cookies, and the body of the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can gain access to potentially sensitive data intended for the server's internal use and not for the client.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when the RESTEasy client makes a call to a server and the server returns a `WebApplicationException`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to trigger the vulnerable RESTEasy client to make a call to a server that responds with a `WebApplicationException`, and have access to the response data.
- The attacker could be a malicious user of a client application using the vulnerable RESTEasy client.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects `resteasy-client` and `resteasy-client-microprofile` artifacts.
- The issue is resolved in RESTEasy version 4.5.9.Final.
- Several Red Hat products were affected and subsequently patched through errata, including:
    - Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
    - Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes
    - Red Hat build of Quarkus
    - Red Hat Satellite
    - Red Hat Fuse
