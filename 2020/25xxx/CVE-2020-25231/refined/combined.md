Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth concept, including protection concept outlined in the system manual.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25228

A service available on port 10005/tcp of the affected devices could allow complete access to all
services without authorization. An attacker could gain full control over an affected device, if he has
access to this service. The system manual recommends to protect access to this port.

CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25229

The implemented encryption for communication with affected devices is prone to replay attacks due to
the usage of a static key. An attacker could change the password or change the conﬁguration on any
affected device if using prepared messages that were generated for another device.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25230

Due to the usage of an outdated cipher mode on port 10005/tcp, an attacker could extract the
encryption key from a captured communication with the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25231

The encryption of program data for the affected devices uses a static key. An attacker could use this
key to extract conﬁdential information from protected program ﬁles.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25232

Due to the usage of an insecure random number generation function and a deprecated cryptographic
function, an attacker could extract the key that is used when communicating with an affected device
on port 8080/tcp.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-25234

The LOGO! program ﬁles generated and used by the affected components offer the possibility to save
user-deﬁned functions (UDF) in a password protected way. This protection is implemented in the
software that displays the information. An attacker could reverse engineer the UDFs directly from
stored program ﬁles.
