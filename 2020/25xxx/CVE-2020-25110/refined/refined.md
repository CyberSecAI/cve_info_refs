{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The function in Nut/Net that processes DNS questions/responses has several issues: there is no check on whether a domain name is NULL-terminated; the DNS response data length is not checked (can be set to arbitrary value from a packet); the number of DNS queries/responses (set in DNS header) is not checked against the data present; the length byte of a domain name in a DNS query/response is not checked and is used for internal memory operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)",
      "Improper Null Termination (CWE-170)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to corrupt memory, put devices into infinite loops, access unauthorized data, and/or poison DNS cache.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send specially crafted network packets that exploit the vulnerabilities.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device."
