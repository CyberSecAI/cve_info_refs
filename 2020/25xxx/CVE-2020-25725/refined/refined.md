Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-25725:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a heap-use-after-free error in Xpdf version 4.02. Specifically, the `SplashOutputDev::endType3Char(GfxState *state)` function in `SplashOutputDev.cc` attempts to access the `t3GlyphStack->cache` after it has already been freed. This occurs when a Type 3 char refers to another char within the same Type 3 font, a scenario that wasn't correctly handled by a previous fix for nested Type 3 characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap-use-after-free:**  The core vulnerability is a use-after-free error. This is a memory safety issue that occurs when a program attempts to access a memory location after it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF document to the `pdftops` tool can lead to a denial-of-service condition. This likely means the program crashes or becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted PDF Document:** The attack vector involves delivering a specifically crafted PDF document to the vulnerable `pdftops` tool. The PDF document needs to contain a particular structure of Type 3 font characters that trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to submit PDF:** An attacker needs the capability to provide a PDF document to the vulnerable `pdftops` tool. This could be done through various means depending on how the tool is used.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in xpdf version 4.02 and is fixed in version 4.03.
- The fix is related to how nested Type 3 characters within a Type 3 font are handled.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mike Zhang from Pangu Lab.
- Red Hat Bugzilla entries indicate that the vulnerability does not affect any commercially supported Red Hat products but does affect Fedora and EPEL.
