Package        : cacti
Version        : 1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-8813 CVE-2020-23226 CVE-2020-25706 CVE-2022-0730
                 CVE-2022-46169
Debian Bug     : 951832 1008693 1025648

Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in cacti, a web
interface for graphing of monitoring systems, which may result in
information disclosure, authentication bypass, or remote code execution.

CVE-2020-8813

    Askar discovered that an authenticated guest user with the graph
    real-time privilege could execute arbitrary code on a server running
    Cacti, via shell meta-characters in a cookie.

CVE-2020-23226

    Jing Chen discovered multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
    vulnerabilities in several pages, which can lead to information
    disclosure.

CVE-2020-25706

    joelister discovered an Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
    templates_import.php, which can lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2022-0730

    It has been discovered that Cacti authentication can be bypassed
    when LDAP anonymous binding is enabled.

CVE-2022-46169

    Stefan Schiller discovered a command injection vulnerability,
    allowing an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a
    server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected (which
    is likely the case on a production instance) for any monitored
    device.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.2.2+ds1-2+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.

For the detailed security status of cacti please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
