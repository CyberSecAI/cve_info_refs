* Bump the MSRV to 1.63.0 (#1207, #1246, #1269, #1341, #1416, #1536); note that 1.60.0 may work for dependents when using `--ignore-rust-version`
* The `serde1` feature has been renamed `serde` (#1477)
* Use `zerocopy` to replace some `unsafe` code (#1349, #1393, #1446, #1502)

### Other

* Allow `rand_core::impls::fill_via_u*_chunks` to mutate source (#1182)
* Add fn `RngCore::read_adapter` implementing `std::io::Read` (#1267)

* Add traits `TryRngCore`, `TryCryptoRng` (#1424, #1499)
* Add bounds `Clone` and `AsRef` to associated type `SeedableRng::Seed` (#1491)
* Rename feature `getrandom` to `os_rng` (#1537)

## [0.6.4] - 2022-09-15

* Fix unsoundness in `<BlockRng64 as RngCore>::next_u32` (#1160)
* Reduce use of `unsafe` and improve gen\_bytes performance (#1180)
* Add `CryptoRngCore` trait (#1187, #1230)

## [0.6.3] - 2021-06-15

* Improved bound for `serde` impls on `BlockRng` (#1130)
* Minor doc additions (#1118)

## [0.6.2] - 2021-02-12

### Fixed

* Fixed assertions in `le::read_u32_into` and `le::read_u64_into` which could
  have allowed buffers not to be fully populated (#1096)

## [0.6.1] - 2021-01-03

### Fixed

* Avoid panic when using `RngCore::seed_from_u64` with a seed which is not a
  multiple of four (#1082)

### Other

* Enable all stable features in the playground (#1081)

## [0.6.0] - 2020-12-08

### Breaking changes

* Bump MSRV to 1.36, various code improvements (#1011)

* Annotate feature-gates in documentation (#1019)
* Document available error codes (#1061)

### Changed

* `alloc` feature in `no_std` is available since Rust 1.36 (#856)
* Added `#[inline]` to `Error` conversion methods (#864)

## [0.5.0] - 2019-06-06

### Changed

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
